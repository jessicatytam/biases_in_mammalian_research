No decline in population size has been detected, and there are no known widespread major threats.","Inhabits semi-desert and mountain steppe habitats along the edge of forests. In China found in thinly wooded savannas and grassy steppes bordering the Gobi desert. In addition to grasslands, they occupy bushy terrain among oaks and white or black beech groves, alpine meadows, and wet areas along river valleys.  Lives in colonies with a labyrinth of burrows.  Burrows are characteristically 8-13 cm in diameter and surrounded by a large mound of soil (up to 2 m in diameter and 40 cm high)  Diurnally active; although most active at dawn and dusk. Diet consists of green vegetation and seeds, but also insects.  Before hibernating makes a store of vegetation to utilize following arousal.  Hibernates from October until late March/mid April.  Reproduce once per year in spring; litters of 3-9 young are produced following a 30 day gestation. Start mating on second year.","Hunting for international trade in skins once occurred at high levels, between 1958 and 1960 it was estimated that as many as 418,400-551,000 individuals were killed annually (Stubbe 1965). This activity is now believed to have ceased and no other threats are known to be impacting upon this species at present.","It is common and sometimes abundant species. Population size very much differs depending on the habitat. For example, in Transbaikalia in steppe river valleys population density is up to 250 burrows per ha (Badmaev 1996). In Tuva it is about 100 burrows per ha (Ol'kova 1962). In other habitats density is much lower, in wormwood and cereal steppe it is about 5 animals per ha, and in subalpine zone it is 1-2 animals per ha (Shilova and Savinetskaya, Biodiversity Conservation Centre web-site, in Russian).",Stable,"Distributed in mountain forest-steppes and steppes from Southern Siberia and Altai (Russia) to Manchuria.

45202281,23036,Viverra civettina,Critically Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) because there are no recent reliable records of wild individuals and none are known in captivity.&#160;Various&#160;surveys during 1990-2014 in potentially suitable habitats across its purported distribution range have generated no records, despite using techniques that reliably find related species when they are present (notably, camera-trapping). This lack of records despite these surveys indicates that its population, if extant at all, is likely to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 individuals. A continuing decline is inferred from the lack of any recent records (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). Its distribution and ecology are effectively unknown, because there are no reliable documented records, ever, of the species in the wild (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). The species is known only from eight specimens collected over a century ago and four more recently, with the last in 1989 (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).","There is no reliable information about Malabar Civet's habitat use or other aspects of its ecology. The several descriptions of habitat use are speculative or based in whole or part on confusion with other species. It seems that it once inhabited lowland forests, lowland swamp and riparian forests in the coastal plain districts of the Western Ghats. Village reports suggested occurrence in thickets in cashew plantations and in highly degraded lowland forests in northern Kerala (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). It could possibly occur in lowland riparian forests in the coastal plain districts (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Based on the natural history of congeners, the species is probably nocturnal, ground-dwelling and readily camera-trapped when present.<br/> <br/> Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats. Present vegetation is secondary in origin (Champion and Seth 1968), and is mostly plantations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Of these, cashew plantations are the least disturbed, because they are not weeded, providing a dense understorey of shrubs and grasses for this ground-living species to take refuge in (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). The pelt records from 1980-1990 were in the region of river valleys, suggesting a possible association with shallow water courses (Ashraf <em>et al</em>, 1993). The closely related Large-spotted Civet is strongly associated with the forested level lowlands (e.g., Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014); whether this is also true of Malabar Civet, which occurs within a rather different small carnivore community (notably, no other species of <em>Viverra</em>&#160;overlaps with it) is unknown.","Assuming habitat use similar to that of&#160;Large-spotted Civet,&#160;Malabar Civet&#160;is likely to have undergone a massive<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;decline<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;a century ago because of extensive conversion&#160;of forest to agriculture.&#160;Coastal plain forest was never extensive in&#160;its presumed range&#160;because the Western Ghats hill range run quite close to the coast along its&#160;length.&#160;Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats (Champion and Seth 1968).&#160;Land-use and habitat changes have not been too drastic in the last century within the assumed distribution range of the Malabar Civet.&#160;The records late in this period, if they were of wild animals, therefore suggest an ability to persist in today's habitat matrix, specifically in deforested areas and/or forest above the plains. In either case, many areas of potentially suitable habitat persist. Thus, habitat factors alone are unlikely to have been an unlikely driver of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;of its present extreme rarity.&#160;There may be significant loss of natural and semi-natural habitat over the next decade with many hydro-power projects being proposed in the region. Cashew plantations, which might hold most of the surviving populations of this species, are threatened by large-scale clearance (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).&#160;<br/> <br/> The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason.&#160;<br/><br/>Villagers report retaliatory killings of civets, taken by the interviewers to include Malabar Civet, for raiding poultry – although there is no hard evidence this species is killed for this reason. Once again it might be a case of mistaken identity between Malabar Civet and Small Indian Civet or even Common Palm Civet.&#160;The most recent skins apparently came from outside protected areas, suggesting that hunting is likely to remain a threat to this already rare species (Ashraf <em>et al</em> 1993). There are a few&#160;protected areas&#160;in the lowland of Kerala, but whether the species inhabits them is unknown.&#160;This species is not selectively hunted, but 10 of 22 reports of animals assessed by Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) to relate to this species and made&#160;during 1950 to 1990 were caught by dogs;&#160;there is no evidence that these reports actually relate even in part to Malabar Civet. Whatever the proportion of report of retaliatory killing and hunting that truly relate to Malabar Civet, that these practices occur in the species's presumed range means that they are likely to threaten any remaining&#160;Malabar Civets.</span>","The population status is unknown but the lack of any even possible record since the advent of widespread camera-trapping suggests that very few animals, at most, persist. Three recent attempts to find the species failed (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/> <br/> This species was formerly believed to be very common in the districts of Malabar and Travancore in southwest India, based on Jerdon (1874). However, Nandini and Mudappa (2010) concluded that&#160;Jerdon’s statements were a case of misidentification of the more common (even now) Small Indian Civet, supporting Pocock’s (1933) doubts about Jerdon’s report. But by the late 1960s it was thought to be near extinction. No sighting was claimed until 1987; then, and subsequently, there have been no confirmed records of wild or captive animals: only equivocal sightings&#160;(without any supporting evidence to confirm the species identification)&#160;and dead animals plausibly from captivity (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).",Decreasing,"Malabar Civet is believed to be endemic to the Western Ghats of&#160;southern&#160;India. All records lack precise locality (historical&#160;specimens all came from zoo animals with no information on original&#160;source)&#160;and most have little or no information on origin. Taken together they suggest a distribution in the lowlands from Kanyakumari in the extreme south north to Wayanad, Coorg, and Honnavar in Karnataka (Pocock 1933, 1939, Corbet and Hill 1992, Nandini and Mudappa 2010). There are only two reports of its occurrence in the higher elevations (over 600 m) of the Western Ghats, in the High Wavy Mountains (Hutton 1949) and at Kudremukh (Karanth 1986). The former is very likely to be in error and the latter was&#160;based on a single-observer sight-record left unidentified for some years&#160;(Nandini and Mudappa 2010). By the late 1960s, the&#160;species&#160;was thought to be near extinction. In the decades until the late 1980s, there were only two possible records, from Kudremukh in Karnataka (Karanth 1986) and from&#160;Tiruvella in Kerala (Kurup 1989); both lack objectively verifiable evidence.&#160;Rai and Kumar (1993) reported possible occurrence in the&#160;state of&#160;Karnataka based on the sighting by Karanth (1986) and unsubstantiated interviews with local hunters.&#160;In the late 1980s, skins of recently killed Malabar Civets were obtained in Elayur, in the lowland Western Ghats, in Malappuram district, Kerala (Kurup 1989) and near Nilambur, northern Kerala (Ahsraf <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993), although&#160;these&#160;seem subsequently to have been lost.","The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason.",Terrestrial,"Malabar Civet is listed in Schedule I, part I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and on CITES Appendix III (India). This species is not known to occur in any protected area and the declaration of large new protected areas in its range is unlikely because of the dense human populations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Ashraf <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. (1993) recommended the following conservation actions for this species: captive breeding (with the possibility of reintroduction if suitable undisturbed areas are identified), field surveys (to investigate whether this species occurs in protected areas) and ecological studies (to determine the threats to this species). An urgent conservation action plan is needed. Given that recently it has been not possible to find the species at all, the option of captive breeding is not currently practical. Reintroduction, assuming that some environmental threats have dissipated the populations, it would need considerable amount of work to nullify those threats having firstly established what they are. Field survey should be continued, although many in the last decade have not yielded any positive results (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). As noted by Nandini and Mudappa (2010) in a detailed review of the knowledge of the Malabar Civet, none of the historical specimens have reliable provenance; and even for the more recent ones it is fairly vague: not one has&#160;a precise wild locality of origin. It therefore is imperative to assess the status of the specimens&#160;in various museums and collections using advanced techniques of molecular genetics. This should consider whether the species is in fact a valid taxon native to India, or an incidental result of the wide trans-shipment of various civet species that occurred around the Indian Ocean counties for many centuries.",Indomalayan,none certain,true,false,Global
45209955,41628,Mydaus javanensis,Least Concern,,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Sunda Stink-badger is listed as Least Concern because it is unlikely to meet any of the Red List criteria at levels&#160;sufficient for even Near Threatened.&#160;It has a large distributional range, occurring on Sumatra, Borneo, Java and the Natuna Islands. It is comparatively frequently camera-trapped over substantial areas of the three major islands, from the lowlands up to 2,000 m asl. On Borneo it seems now to be largely restricted to the northeast, although historically it was recorded from other regions in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo; see Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). The reasons for the lack of recent records from large parts of Kalimantan are unknown (see Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). However, any potential declines in these areas most probably occurred some decades ago, and not within the last 14 years (or three generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Records from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, indicate that this species uses disturbed forests (its occupancy being higher in more disturbed forests than in sustainably managed forests; Sollmann <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and palm oil plantations (A.J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014). This species evidently tolerates, perhaps even benefits from, some forms of habitat disturbance (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in prep.). Thus it is unlikely that it is experiencing major declines from the ongoing deforestation in the region. There is no evidence of its being recently targeted for food or medicine at levels&#160;sufficient&#160;to drive population declines at a pace to come near to even Near Threatened. Historical accounts, however, indicate that in the Indonesian part of Borneo, the species was frequently sought for food (see Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.), and hunting might have been one of the factors contributing to historical declines","Over its range,&#160;Sunda Stink-badger&#160;is found in primary and secondary forests and open grounds such as gardens adjacent to forests (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Holden 2006). In Sabah it is found in both primary and disturbed forests and from the periphery out to a least four kilometres from the forest edge of oil-palm plantations. It is unknown how far it is able to venture into the plantation landscape. In Sarawak it has been recorded in a pepper garden (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). It is quite clear that it is not dependent upon primary forest. Camera-trapping at salt-licks in Sabah found it to be a common visitor (Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>This species feeds on birds'&#160;eggs, carrion, insects, worms and plants (Long and Killingley 1983, Neal and Cheeseman 1996, Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1985). Litter size is usually two to three (Wood 1865). It is nocturnal, sheltering in underground burrows during the day (Hwang and Larivière 2003).<br/><br/>It is currently unknown why the species has such a patchy distribution, especially on Borneo. The species' pattern of occurrence might be linked to earthworm density, soil characters, level of (perhaps mostly past) hunting and/or other factors.","Habitat loss is unlikely to be a significant threat to&#160;Sunda Stink-badger, and at least in parts of its range the widespread degradation and fragmentation of forest might be benefiting it, as might conversion of old-growth forest to some other uses. The threat posed by hunting is difficult to assess. It might, perhaps, have led to past declines and local extirpations, but the lack of a large commercial demand for it today and its persistence in many areas close to people suggests that hunting is not presently a threat.","This species occurs in a wide range of vegetation types, including - at least in Sabah, Malaysia - very disturbed areas and plantations. So the population is likely to be relatively unaffected by the large-scale forest conversion in its range. It is currently unknown why this species was reported as common in various parts of Kalimantan in the early 20th century, yet current records from these areas are lacking. For example, in the 1930s, this species was considered “to have a very wide distribution range, including all wet and dry forests of the area discussed here [southern and&#160;southeastern &#160;Borneo]. The density however is low. In eastern Borneo its occurrence was reported&#160;only&#160;from the area north of Samarinda, and in southern Borneo from only nine locations, which were dispersed and far from each other” (Nederlandsch-Indische Vereeniging tot Natuurbescherming 1939). Its distribution seems to be patchy (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). It is conceivable that local extinctions have occurred, perhaps&#160;through hunting. The overall population of the species is plausibly rather stable, given its high adaptability to changing habitats, at least over the time frame of three generations.",Stable,"Sunda Stink-badger is found on Java, Kalimantan (Borneo), Sumatra and the Natuna Islands in Indonesia, and in Sabah and Sarawak in Bornean Malaysia. So far there are no confirmed records from Brunei, but parts of the country are predicted to contain habitat&#160;suitable&#160;for the species (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). On Borneo it is among the most frequently recorded carnivore species in most camera-trapping studies in the Malaysian State of Sabah (Borneo Carnivore Symposium; Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). It is found from the lowlands in central and eastern Sabah (e.g. Kinabatangan) up to the highlands in western Sabah (e.g. Crocker Range National Park, A. J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014). In Sarawak nearly all the rather few records are from the northeastern part (Limbang and North Miri division); records south of Miri division are very few, and local people often seem unfamiliar with the species (Giman and Jukie 2012, Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). But in 2012, two animals were killed in the Serian district, southwest Sarawak (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). In Kalimantan this species seems to have been recorded&#160;recently&#160;only in north and east Kalimantan (e.g., Rustam and Giordano 2014), but it was also at least locally common in south, central and west Kalimantan in the beginning of the 20th century (e.g., Lyon 1911). In west Kalimantan a specimen was collected at the Melawi river near Sintang (Medway 1977) and the recently interviewed local people from this area were familiar with this species (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.).&#160;In Java all known recent records are from west Java, but van Balen (1914) recorded it from the Dieng Plateau in central Java and there are further records from Mt Ardjuna and the Tenger Mountains in east Java (Horsfield 1824, Hassan 1892). In west Java it seems to be common in the remaining forests, with recent records from various sites including Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, Gunung Halimun Salak NP, Gunung Ciremai NP and Gunung Malabar Protected Forest (A. Ario pers. comm. 2014) at elevations from the lowlands up to 2,000 m asl; its status in non-forest areas is unclear.&#160;In Sumatra it has recently been recorded in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park between 600 and 1,100 m asl (J. McCarthy pers. comm. 2014) in the south of the island, up to Aceh (between 870 and 1,740 m asl) in the north (M. Linkie pers. comm. 2014). Further recent records come from Kerinci Seblat NP (Holden 2006, M. Linkie pers. comm. 2014) and the Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape (P.H. Pratje and A.M. Moßbrucker pers. comm. 2014).","On Java, the anal gland secretion is used to make perfume (Long and Killingley 1983). Some rural people eat the flesh of this species (Rustam and Giordano 2014).

45220632,41710,Viverricula indica,Least Concern,,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Small Indian Civet is listed as Least Concern because of its wide geographical distribution, wide use of (in some biomes, preference for) degraded and fragmented natural habitat, with evidence from many range states of healthy populations in agricultural/secondary landscapes.&#160;It persists in the face of heavy hunting that has wiped out many other ground-dwelling species; while some populations (notably, in Lao PDR and Viet Nam) might be depressed by hunting, this is not to the extent of driving declines (averaged across the whole range) sufficient for categorising the species even as Near Threatened. It is mainly an open-forest and edge species, so has probably benefited from the extensive degradation and fragmentation over the last century of evergreen&#160;forest&#160;in South-east Asia.","Small Indian Civet has been recorded in a wide range of habitats, particularly in degraded and fragmented landscapes (including rainforest fragments, tea and coffee plantations; Mudappa <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in less encroached areas, in deciduous forest, bushland, grassland, riverine habitats, marshes (Holden and Neang 2009), and inactive <em>Melaleuca</em> plantations on peat soil in the Mekong Delta, Viet Nam (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Camera-trapping in Bangladesh found the species across a large array of suitable habitat, from mangrove to semi-evergreen, evergreen and deciduous forest to mixed bamboo vegetation and shrubs (Feeroz <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012, Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014, Abu Abdullay Diyan pers. comm. 2014). It occurs around human habitation in towns and villages in North-east India (Choudhury 2013) but in southern India it is less common in&#160;such areas&#160;than is Common Palm Civet <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em>&#160;(D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Records certainly from deep within closed-canopy evergreen forest are rare (but do occur; e.g. Naniwadekar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), both in India and South-east Asia (Duckworth 1997; Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al.</em>2008; Mudappa 2002, 2013; Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Although coarse GIS analysis of record locations against habitat can suggest wide occurrence in evergreen forest, a detailed check of exact record locations in Thailand in evergreen forest biomes showed that they were mostly outside forest, in adjacent cleared or naturally open areas; those within evergreen forest were in small patches and strips amid deciduous or degraded habitat, such as riverine gallery forest, or were in the late dry season when adjoining deciduous forest had been heavily burnt (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Similarly, records in Virachey National Park, northern Cambodia (WWF unpublished data), which at a landscape scale looks like a massive block of semi-evergreen forest/evergreen forest, are clearly associated with small pockets of&#160;grassland and somewhat open-canopy deciduous forest (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Finally, in the Western Ghats, India, it was more frequent in rainforest fragments than in the relatively undisturbed, large, contiguous tract of rainforest in Kalakad–Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (Mudappa <em>et al</em>. 2007). By contrast, it is evidently widespread in little-encroached deciduous forests (e.g., Pillay 2009, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014) and in some semi-evergreen forests (e.g. Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India; Kalle <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). It might be one of few civets that is not forest-dependent at some level: where hunting levels are low, it is common in various areas almost entirely deforested, notably Hong Kong (Pei&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002,&#160;Suen 2002) and there are many other records from such areas - mindful of the very little survey that occurs within them - elsewhere in its range (e.g., Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>This species is nocturnal and is active&#160;mostly on the ground (Mudappa 2002). An adult male radio-tracked in Thailand had a home range of 3.1 km² (Rabinowitz, 1991). In Thailand, it may live in drains, outhouses, and roofs, eating rats, mice, birds, snakes, fruit, roots, and carrion (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It has litters of 3-5, and the life-span (in captivity) is 8-9 years (Lekagul and McNeely&#160;1977). Wang and Fuller (2001) studied this species in a rural agricultural area near the village of Taohong in northern Jiangxi Province, south-eastern China, from April 1993 to November 1994. Analysis of faeces between June 1992 and November 1994 found that this species ate mostly mammals, with moderate amounts of insects and fruits.","Small Indian Civet is widely used, for various reasons. There has been heavy harvest for skins in China (Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010) and probably to some extent elsewhere. For the production of its perineal gland secretion, 'civet' musk, a raw ingredient in the perfume, medicine and other industries, large numbers are kept in India and, increasingly, Thailand; these are sourced almost entirely from the wild (e.g., Balakrishnan and Sreedevi 2007, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). It is the second most commonly traded civet in Java, Indonesia, where there is a current craze for keeping civets at pets, with the mushrooming of civet-'lovers' clubs; numbers in this trade are however dwarfed by those of Common Palm Civet, with almost 20 times as many of the latter seen (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014). While hunting (including the use of traps for civets) seems to be rare in some of its range, such as Java (Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014),&#160;a large part of its range - North-east India, southern China and northern South-east Asia - has heavy to very heavy mammal hunting using, in great part, non-selective techniques such as snaring, for domestic consumption and, in many areas, sale into the urban and international wildlife trade.&#160;In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, local people kill Small Indian Civets (for meat consumption) with poison (S. Chakma per H. Rahman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;The demand for civet meat in Chinese and Viet Namese markets has increased rapidly since the 1980s (Bell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004) and remains high.&#160;This species is perhaps somewhat insulated from the heaviest pressures because such activities are mostly within closed evergreen forest, only a marginal habitat of this species. On the other hand, its use of marginal and degraded habitats means it might suffer more than do the more closed-forest associated small carnivores from retaliatory killing (as a pest of poultry), secondary accumulation of rodenticides (heavily used in some parts of its range) and killing by domestic dogs. It is reasonably clear that, in aggregate, these threats are not causing steep declines in India, Myanmar and southern China (where it remains common even though most other small carnivores are severely depleted (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010); the situation is less clear in northern South-east Asia, where hunting is highest, because of the species' limited occurrence in closed evergreen forest, which hosts the majority of wildlife survey and research. It is clearly widespread even in Viet Nam and Lao PDR, but populations there are probably well below what they would be in the absence of hunting.<br/><br/>Forest loss and degradation are unlikely to be, overall, a threat to this species; the opening-up of large areas of closed-canopy old-growth evergreen forest in South-east Asia has probably increased the total habitat availability, more than offsetting the losses from conversion of open deciduous forest to habitats supporting lower densities of this species (such forests are being lost rapidly, at present, in Cambodia and perhaps Myanmar). Its use of agriculture-dominated landscapes, while common, is poorly understood: it is quite plausible that the rapid intensification of field crop systems in Java, Thailand, Vietnam, China and, increasingly, Lao PDR and Cambodia will be reducing habitat suitability over large areas, particularly through loss of uncultivated patches: daytime resting sites in Hlawga Park, Myanmar, were typically at ground level in dense shrubby tangles (Su Su and Sale 2007); and such patches are also likely to increase food supply over that in crop monoculture.<br/><br/>In sum, while further information would be useful in elaborating the detail of the response to the various potential threats facing this species, its continued abundance in most of its range indicates that it is well able to survive the current levels of threats.","Small Indian Civet remains widespread and common in India and Sri Lanka (Choudhury 2013, Mudappa 2013, S. Ratnayeke pers. comm. 2007) &#160;and in Bangladesh, where it has recently been camera-trapped in the North-east, South-east and in the Sundarbans' largest mangroves&#160;(Feeroz <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012; Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). Its population status in&#160;South-east&#160;Asia is less well known than that of some other sympatric small carnivores, because recent survey efforts have mostly not been appropriate for assessing the species. This is well shown by records from Thailand, where in several survey areas with intensive coverage, camera-trapping failed to find the species yet there were incidental records by other methods&#160;(Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Similarly, in Myanmar, Su Su (2005) found that it was the second most common species of small carnivore recorded in Hlawga Wildlife Park in Myanmar, a secondary small isolate of semi-natural habitat in the outskirts of Yangon, a former capital city, subject to little-controlled poaching and other forms of encroachment, where few other species of small carnivore persist in significant numbers. Camera-trapping showed that it is also abundant (by far the most frequently photographed nocturnal small carnivore) in Alungdaw Kathapa National Park (Thaint Thaint Myo pers. comm. 2007), although intensive camera-trapping for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;a few years earlier at this site had recorded the species only twice. This reflected the focus of the Tiger survey on little-disturbed evergreen forest, a habitat little-used by the species in South-east Asia, rather than the edge, disturbed and secondary areas the focus of the latter survey (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). The habitat degradation and hunting patterns of these two sites in Myanmar where the species is common are representative of much of non-Sundaic South-east Asia, and incidental records from various other sites (e.g. Duckworth and Robichaud 2005) imply large populations in total in this region, although it is likely that in&#160;at least&#160;Viet Nam and Lao PDR populations are somewhat depleted by snaring and other forms of hunting. This is also likely to be true in southern China (<em>sensu</em>&#160;Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010;&#160;Guangxi, Guangdong and Hainan), an area where most small carnivores are somewhat to greatly depleted; Small Indian Civet remains one of the most widely recorded&#160;small carnivores there (Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). It is also widespread and common on Hong Kong (Pei <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;The widespread tendency for camera-trap and spotlight surveys to go to the least encroached habitat blocks, with a focus on evergreen forest, has certainly much reduced the number of recent records of the species from South-east Asia. In Cambodia, where more camera-trapping has taken place in deciduous forest, it is commonly photographed (e.g. Holden &amp; Neang 2009, Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014). Under-survey of appropriate habitat was suspected to be responsible for the relatively few recent records from Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and explains the rather low proportion of camera-trap survey areas in Viet Nam with records (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3; D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014), and may also have generated earlier remarks such as in Thailand, this species is rather rare (Lekagul and McNeely 1977); in fact, it is common in degraded and open habitats (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Similarly, in Java, a survey programme found it in only one area, an agricultural landscape, with no records from forest. There is little information on current status in West Malaysia and Sumatra; these are being dominated, pre-clearance, by evergreen forest would be expected to hold small populations, although these might have increased with recent major deforestation. A collation of incidental records from West Malaysia (Low 2011) had none of this species, despite many of other species from road-sides and degraded areas, from where come many records elsewhere in the species' range. A trade survey of civets at Medan, Sumatra, found none (Shepherd 2008), implying only small, at most, wild populations there.<br/><br/>Considering trends of habitat change, potentially populations will have increased with the degradation and fragmentation of closed evergreen forest across much of the specie's&#160;range in recent decades; the ability of the species to take advantage of this will have been offset, in some parts of its range, notably northern South-east Asia and southern China, by increased trade driven-hunting, especially using non-selective methods. Overall the population is likely to be relatively stable.",Stable,"Small Indian Civet occurs in&#160;Sri Lanka, Pakistan (Indus valley eastwards),&#160;most of India (recently confirmed to extend north of the Pir Pinjal, Kashmir),&#160;Nepal,&#160;south and central China (north to Sichuan and the lower Yangtze, including Hainan and Hong Kong), Taiwan province of China, Bangladesh (North-east, South-east and in the Sundarbans), mainland South-east Asia (almost throughout) and various islands of Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Bali, Bawean, Bintan, Kangean, Lombok, Panaitan, and Sumbawa; it should not be assumed to be native to those lying east of Bali) (Roberts 1997, Wang 2003, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008,&#160;Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Charoo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Jennings and Veron 2011, Choudhury 2013, Mudappa 2013,&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;S. Ratnayeke pers. comm. 2007, Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Its origin and current status on Sumatra is unclear: the species is known on the island only from a few records from North Sumatra (named <em>V. malaccensis atchinensis</em>&#160;Sody, 1931) and there are no published records from southern Sumatra (although Corbet and Hill [1992] included all of Sumatra in the species' distribution), nor was it found in a trade survey of civets at Medan (Shepherd 2008). This queries its persistence there, given levels of trade in civets in Medan, and the proportion of civets&#160;in similar trade in neighbouring Java that are Small Indian Civets (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is implausible that it could have been hunted out of Sumatra (given its persistence in today's heavily hunted landscapes of northern South-east Asia and&#160;southern China), suggesting the strong possibility that earlier records from Sumatra were of imports. It has been stated to occur in Singapore but there is no evidence of this and it is implausible that it is present but overlooked (Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). It has been introduced to Madagascar and the Comoros (Goodman 2012), Socotra (Yemen; Pocock 1939) and Unguja, Pemba and Mafia Islands of Tanzania (Pakenham 1984, Kock and Stanley 2009). The current distribution of these introduced populations is poorly known (but is of no significance to the species's conservation).<br/><br/>It occurs from sea-level to 2,500 m (North-east India; Choudhury 2013).","Small Indian Civet is widely used, for various reasons. There has been heavy harvest for skins in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). For the production of its perineal gland secretion, 'civet' musk, a raw ingredient in the perfume, medicine and other industries, large numbers are kept in India and, increasingly, Thailand; these are sourced almost entirely from the wild (e.g., Balakrishnan and Sreedevi 2007, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). A large part of its range - North-east India, southern China and northern South-east Asia - has heavy to very heavy mammal hunting using, in great part, non-selective techniques such as snaring, for domestic consumption and, in many areas, sale into the urban and international wildlife trade. This species is perhaps somewhat insulated from the heaviest pressures because such activities are mostly within closed evergreen forest, only a marginal habitat of this species.",Terrestrial,"This species is totally protected in Myanmar&#160;under the Wildlife Act of 1994 (Su Su 2005) and in Bangladesh under the Wildlife Act 2012 (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). It is protected in Thailand, with captive breeding allowed (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is listed on Category II of the China Wildlife Protection Law (1988) (Li <em>et al</em>. 2000) and as ‘Vulnerable’ in the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004). It is listed on CITES Appendix III by India. It has been recorded in many protected areas across its range. There is no harvest management plan; while this is probably not problematic at present, if agricultural intensification does reduce habitat suitability and if trade demand for 'civet' remains high, because this is a species living primarily in areas with some to heavy human use, it is possible that off-take might drive declines in the future and that a harvest management plan (or captive breeding to supply 'civet' production units) would be warranted.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
61977139,13895,Moschus chrysogaster,Endangered,A2cd,2016,2014-11-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Confirmed as Endangered because of a probable serious population decline, estimated to be more than 50% over the last three generations (approximately 21 years), inferred from over-exploitation, shrinkage in distribution, and habitat destruction and degradation. Although there is no direct data available regarding recent declining population rates, the above-mentioned rate of decline seems reasonable based on the high levels of harvesting and habitat loss. It should also be noted that a widely repeated but poorly documented estimate is that there were 180,000 wild individuals in China in the 1960s and 1970s (Yang <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Zhou <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004), but Sheng (1998) reported no more than 100,000 within China in the 1990s. No substantive new information on the species' status was received for the re-assessment.","This species is found on barren plateaus at high altitudes, where it occupies meadows, fell-fields, shrublands or fir forests, typically preferring shaded steeper slopes with less human disturbance. In western Sichuan, where it overlaps the distribution of <em>M. berezovskii</em>, the alpine musk deer inhabits the higher elevations (above 2,000 m asl, usually 4,000-4,500 m asl), compared with the 1,0002,500 m altitudinal range of <em>M. berezovskii</em>. <br/><br/>It is predominantly a browser, feeding mainly on shrubs, forbs, leaves, moss, lichens, shoots, grasses, and twigs (Green 1987). The proportion of leaves and tender shoots in the diet is highest in spring and summer, buds and flowers in late summer, and leaves, twigs and flowers of forbs and shrubs later in the year (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011, Syed and Ilyas 2012).<br/><br/>Its main predators include yellow-throated marten, fox, wolf, and lynx. Snow leopard reportedly preys on the species in Nepal (Aryal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) It is generally solitary and crepuscular (Harris and Cai 1993). Population density varies from 3.9 /km² in more arid habitats to 71 /km² in areas with higher rainfall. Densities are lower in areas with heavy snow cover and where there are more competitors (goral, serow and domestic cattle).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs primarily in November-December, with the resulting offspring being born from May to June. After birth, young deer lie hidden in secluded areas, essentially independent of their mothers except at feeding times. This hiding period may last up to 2 months. Gestation is variously reported at from 150-195 days (Hayssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993) and give birth to one offspring (twins are sometimes reported by documentation is lacking). Fawns wean at 3-4 months, are sexually mature at 16-24 months. <br/><br/>Alpine musk deer is sedentary, tending to remain within defined home ranges. In females these are about 125 acres in size, while males will control a territory that encompasses the ranges of several females, possibly defending it against other males. The species is not known to migrate. Communication between individuals is thought to be based primarily on their sense of smell, due to the high development of the glands of musk deer. It is primarily silent, musk deer will emit a loud double hiss if alarmed.","The musk produced by this genus of primitive deer is highly valued for its cosmetic and alleged pharmaceutical properties, and can fetch U.S. $45,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the international market. Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of the brown waxy substance. Such poaching is relatively easy to accomplish and difficult to stop using only legal means (Harris 1991, 2007). In Nepal, the increased price of musk deer on the international market has reportedly led to an increase in poaching and trade in the Himalayas (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2010). Poaching and trade of the species for musk is described as ""unabated"" and the principle threat in Uttarakhand, India (Ilyas 2014).<br/><br/>Musk deer also appear to require dense vegetation, either in the form of intact forests or shrublands, thus excessive forest clearing or grazing can preclude musk deer from using such lands (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003). Furthermore, grazing of livestock within protected areas may pose a threat to musk deer through both competition and through disease transmission (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2010).","Estimating population sizes or trends for musk deer is very difficult, and has rarely been done satisfactorily. Population estimates over large-scale areas are subject to considerable uncertainty (and this is exacerbated by uncertainty over taxonomy). A widely repeated but poorly documented estimate is that there were 180,000 individuals in the 1960s and 1970s (Yang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Zhou <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004), but Sheng (1998) reported no more than 100,000 within China in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Liu and Sheng (2002) estimated population sizes in three Chinese nature reserves in the mid 1990s using extrapolations from counts of pellet groups, but provided few details. They estimated 183227 in the Helan Mountain Nature Reserve in Ningxia, 131-160 in the Shoulu Mountain Nature Reserve in Gansu, and 4,717-5,798 in the Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve in Gansu. More recent reports suggest that the species has become very rare in the Helan Mountains (Liu, Z.S., East China Normal University pers. comm., 2006) and has been severely depleted since in northwest Yunnan as a result of overexploitation. Snaring has become one of the main threats to the species in northwest Yunnan (Xueyou and Xuelong 2014).<br/><br/>Anecdotal evidence points to a continued decline in abundance within China. Although population estimates contained in Yang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2003) are unreliable, data on musk purchased by local Traditional Chinese Medicine companies probably reflect real trends, and these suggested dramatic declines in musk deer populations during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, Tibet, and Shaanxi. <br/><br/>In Nepal, within protected areas the numbers of the species is reportedly increasing (Aryal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). There is an estimated 600-800 animals in Sagarmatha National Park at densities of up to 45/km², more than 1000 in Shey-Phoksundo National Park, an estimated 500 animals in Langtang National Park, and it also occurs in Annapurna Conservation Area, Kanchanjunga Conservation Area, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve Khaptad National Park and Makulu-Barun National Park. Outside of protected areas the species is declining (Aryal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).",Decreasing,"This species occurs from the highlands of central China (the Helan mountains form the northern edge of the distribution), south and west to the Himalayas, extending to eastern Nepal, Bhutan, and northeastern India (Sathyakumar 2002, Wemmer 1998).

Captive breeding, primarily for commercial musk production, occurs in various places in China, and might have some conservation benefit. However, to date, there is little evidence that the availability of musk from captive-bred animals has had a positive conservation impact (Parry-Jones and Wu 2001, Green <em>et al.</em> 2007, Harris 2007).

The Institute of Biology of the Mongolian Academy of Science assessed the Mongolian population size in 1986 over 53,000 hectares across 63 units of six provinces, resulting in an estimate of 44,000 individuals. The population size is continuing to decrease: densities fell from six per 5 km<sup>2</sup>, to one per 5 km<sup>2</sup> in one observed population between 1990 and 2000 (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000, Tsendjav 2002). Similar levels of declines due to poaching are believed to have taken place elsewhere within its range. Generation length has been estimated as six years based on data from Nowak (1991). As the causes of this decline, primarily exploitation, is expected to result in a population reduction of at least 30% over the next three generations, <em>Moschus moschiferus</em> qualifies as Vulnerable under Criterion A3d, and as well as A2d and A4d because of past declines. Further research could show that the species is declining more seriously than has been supposed, and could possible qualify for listing as Endangered.","Inhabiting mountainous taiga (broadleaf and needle forest), these animals are typically found in forests of dense birch (<em>Betula</em> spp.) and larch (<em>Larix</em> spp.), and shrub-covered slopes in sub-alpine zones (Dulamtseren 1977, Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). In Russia it inhabits the mid-mountain belt where it prefers dark coniferous forest with dense shrubs and rocky outcrops, using such rocky areas to escape from predators (Prohod’ko 2002). However, lichens are the main part of Siberian Musk Deer diet, accounting for up to 99% of the food intake in winter. During the rest of the year the percentage of lichen in the diet is still high, but these deer also consume grasses, leaves and mushrooms. When feeding it is able to climb on inclined trunks up to 3-4 m above ground. Population density is highly correlated with the availability of food and hiding places. The average population density is about 0.6 animals per square kilometre, although under favourable conditions this may be as high as 4-8.5 animals per square kilometre (Prohod’ko 2002). It has a thick coat for insulation and is well adapted for walking through deep snow.  The species is preyed upon by a suite of predators including lynx, wolverine, yellow-throated marten, and rarely wolf, tiger, and bear. When chased, musk deer head for rocky terrain, and will try to reach an inaccessible crag or a shelter. If neither is available, the animal begins to run in circles. Although they can run exceptionally fast, musk deer tire after only 200-300 metres.<br/><br/>It is solitary, though it sometimes occurs in small groups (no more than three individuals) of a female with her young. In the Altai, family groups consist usually of an adult permanent pair and the young of the year. The territory of female and young lies within the territory of a male. Sometimes the group includes young males up to two years old, that are submissive to the adult male, but actively participate in making and protecting common territory (Prohod’ko 2002). The species is primarily active at dusk and dawn. While foraging, a musk deer may travel 3-7 km per night, generally returning to the same spot (a ""lair"") every morning. Individuals inhabit home ranges between 200 and 300 hectares in size, sticking to the boundaries steadfastly. The size of the home range decreases markedly during the second half of winter. Seasonal migrations are minimal if present at all. Reproduction starts in December, although some females do not mate until March (Prohod’ko 2002). Females gestate for just over 6 months, and give birth to 1-3 offspring, usually in May or June. Young wean at 3-4 months, and are mature at 15-17 months. Animals live in the wild for 10-14 years.","As the common name suggests, males secrete musk from a preputial gland (the “musk-pod”). This musk forms the basis for many perfumes, and is highly valued for traditional medicines (Wemmer 1998). Each male produces only around 25 g of musk (Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). Although this musk can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac.<br/><br/>Illegal, unsustainable hunting for musk is the principal threat to this species. An estimated 25,000 adult males were killed through harvesting and illegal hunting between 1990 and 2001 (Homes 2004). As hunting is often indiscriminate of sex and age, four to five Siberian Musk Deer are estimated to be killed per musk-pod harvested (Green 1987). As cheaper, synthetic alternatives for making perfumes are becoming more popular, use of musk in the perfume industry is decreasing, but its value for cardiac, circulatory and respiratory traditional medicines remains high. During the 1970s, the international market value of musk reached up to US$45,000 per kg. Between 1995 and 2001, the number of traders in musk increased six-fold, following a similar increase in the market price of musk-pods (Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Resource extraction such as mining is not causing a substantial loss of habitat at present, but the resulting human disturbance from this activity does constitute a threat. Habitat fragmentation may also threaten the species (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000).","During the 1920s and 1930s numbers were sharply reduced through hunting. In the 1970s the Mongolian population size was estimated to be between 60,000 and 80,000 animals (Dulamtseren 1977). In 1986, the Institute of Biology of the Mongolian Academy of Science assessed Musk Deer population sizes in over 53,000 hectares across 63 units of six provinces, resulting in an estimate of approximately 44,000 individuals. The population size in Mongolia continued to decrease: between 1990 and 2000, densities fell from six per 5 km<sup>2</sup>, to one per 5 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in one observed population (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000, Tsendjav 2002). Likewise, all populations in Russia are considered declining. Population estimates from the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in 1999 put the Sakhalin population at about 600-650 individuals (still declining), the Eastern Siberian population at about 27,000-30,000 individuals, and the population in the Russian Far East at up to 150,000 individuals (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm.).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In 2011, across 10 federal regions of Siberia the total population of the species was estimated at approximately 110,000 individuals (Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources 2012).

It is believed to be contracting in range in China, and had apparently disappeared from Xinjiang by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.",Decreasing,"This species occurs widely in the Russian Federation (Siberia and the Far East), extreme eastern Kazakhstan, northeastern and northwestern China, Mongolia, Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Tsendjav 2002).

Forest Musk Deer eat leaves, grasses, moss, lichens, shoots and twigs. These animals are shy, sedentary and remain within a defined home range throughout the year. Males utilize their large musk gland to defend their territory and attract mates. When alarmed they make great leaps with wild changes of direction. They can adroitly jump into trees to forage. Their main predators include leopard, marten, fox, wolf, lynx and especially humans. Gestation lasts 6.5 months, after which one or two young are born. During the first two months, the young deer lie hidden in secluded areas, independent of their mothers except at feeding times. They are weaned within three to four months and reach sexual maturity by 24 months.  Animals may live up to 20 years.

It may, however, be undergoing some localised declines through hunting, including the off-take of wild animals (males) for the production of civetone, which is used as a fixing agent in the perfume industry.","African Civets occupy a wide variety of habitats including secondary forest, woodland, and bush habitats, as well as aquatic environments. They are generally absent from arid regions, with the exception of riverine systems therein. They are apparently uncommon in mature interior forest habitats, but will infiltrate deep forest via logging roads, and in the forests of West and Central Africa, they thrive in degraded and deforested areas, and are regularly encountered near villages (Ray 2013). They are also found on cultivated land, for instance in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Ethiopia (Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;African Civets are&#160;omnivorous and opportunistic foragers (Ray and Sunquist 2001,&#160;Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008b,&#160;Amiard 2014), and their diet may include cereals (maize, wheat, barley)&#160;and domestic fruits (e.g., bananas, figs, olives; Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008b). They are terrestrial, nocturnal and solitary, with exception of the breeding season when two or more individuals can be seen together. In Ethiopia, in the Bale Mountains National Park, one radio-tracked sub-adult male had a home range of 11.1 km²&#160;(Admasu <em>et al.</em> 2004), while in Wondo Genet, one adult male (0.74 km²) and one sub-adult female (0.82 km²) ranged over much smaller areas (Ayalew <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last two individuals moved at an average speed of 326 m/h and travelled between 1.33 and 4.24 km each night.","There are no major threats to the species. However, African Civets are commonly found for sale as bushmeat, for example in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al.</em> 2013) as well as in SE Nigeria, where they are used for both food and skin (Angelici <em>et al.</em> 1999). They are frequently found trapped for meat in other countries, including Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, DR Congo and Central African Republic (Ray 2013). The majority of animals (generally males, because of&#160;their higher civet musk production) kept for the trade of civetone are taken from the wild, and such off-takes are likely to have localised&#160;impacts&#160;on wild populations, as well as potentially to lead to a severely female-biased sex ratio. In addition, several African Civets have been reported to die within the first three weeks of capture&#160;because of&#160;severe stress and physical assault during capture and transportation (Pugh 1998). There are also some concerns about the welfare of these animals, which are typically maintained in very small cages in order to facilitate handling during musk extraction from the perineal glands.","This species is generally common. In South Africa, Amiard (2014) reported densities&#160;of 7.5–14.2 individuals/100 km²)&#160;in three game reserves located in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, respectively; these estimates were based on&#160;camera-trapping and individual identification (using natural markings on the flanks).&#160;Using the same methods,&#160;Isaacs <em>et al.</em> (in press) reported slightly lower densities (4.43–8.63 individuals/100 km²) in three study sites—two conservation areas and one mosaic area made of ecotourism, hunting and livestock farms—within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve (Limpopo). These authors hypothesised that differences in African Civet density might result from top-down regulation from large carnivores, recreational hunting, poisoning, resource provisioning or human activity.",Unknown,"African Civet is widely distributed in Africa from Senegal and Mauritania to southern Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and southern Somalia southwards in all countries to northeastern Namibia, north and east Botswana, and northeastern South Africa (Ray 2013).

Even though synthetic alternatives have been available for nearly 70 years, civetone remains an important export commodity in several countries, such as Ethiopia, and to a lesser extent, Niger and Senegal (Ray 1995, 2013; Abebe 2003; Ray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>Between 1985 and 1997, civiculture (civet cat farming) generated a total revenue of between&#160;<em>ca</em>&#160;US$ 150,000–835,000 per year in Africa.&#160;According to Kumera (2005 <em>in</em>&#160;Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008b), there are over 200 registered and licensed African Civet farmers who capture African Civets in the wild and keep several thousand individuals in captivity for musk production in Ethiopia.&#160;In that country, only 2% of the civet musk produced is used nationally; the rest is exported, essentially to France (85%), for the perfume industry (Girma 1995).

The diversity and scale of threats—recent, ongoing, and projected—have far outpaced effort at documentation. Moreover, this species is the sole living representative of its family (which represents an ancient lineage in the order Cetartiodactyla), and therefore its extinction would mean not just the loss of a single species, but loss of an entire mammalian family regarded as a sister taxon to all other cetaceans. Based on available evidence, the species qualifies for listing as Endangered under criterion A.<br/> <br/> Only very limited data are available on life history. Age at first reproduction is probably between 6-10 years (Brownell 1984) and maximum longevity may be close to 30. Therefore, generation time is probably well over 10 but possibly less than 20 years, which would mean that three generations equals at least 30 years (i.e., from 1987 counting backwards or until 2047 counting forwards) but less than 60 (i.e., from 1957 counting backwards or until 2077 counting forwards). <br/> <br/> <strong>Criterion A. Population size reduction</strong>: There is no rigorous quantitative estimate of abundance for this species with which to be able to reliably estimate changes in abundance over a three-generation time period (30-60 years). This is particularly the case for the Ganges Dolphin, but is also true for the Indus Dolphin. Although one Indus Dolphin subpopulation (Guddu to Sukkur) appears to be increasing in abundance, almost everywhere else in the range of that subspecies the subpopulations partitioned by barrages are being extirpated and therefore the overall range of Indus Dolphins is shrinking. &#160;In the absence of reliable information on rangewide trends in abundance of the species, declines in the extent of occurrence of both Indus and Ganges Dolphins can be used to supplement the supporting evidence of reduced abundance and habitat deterioration and loss.<br/> <br/> Subcriterion A1 does not apply because even if the decline in abundance has been greater than 70%, the causes are not clearly reversible, are not understood, and have not ceased.<br/> <br/> Subcriterion A2 applies because a population size reduction of more than 50% since 1957 is suspected, given that nearly all of the critical dam and barrage construction associated with the large-scale decline in the area of occupancy of both subspecies has occurred since that time. The increases in riverine pollution, especially in the Ganges, have occurred within the last thirty years following industrialisation and intensification of plains agriculture and reduction of flushing ability of rivers after dam construction. Finally, the large-scale global introduction of monofilament gillnets in the 1960s and 1970s means that fishing-related mortality of these dolphins has increased, probably dramatically, since then. The reduction in population size continues, and its causes have not ceased (more barrages are planned and under construction, habitat quality is expected to deteriorate further, mortality primarily from fishing gear entanglement but also hunting continues in some areas, and range continues to contract). The causes are not fully understood and may not be reversible. The basis for listing could rest on any or all of (a) to (e).<br/> <br/> Subcriteria A3 and A4 also apply because a population size reduction of more than 50% can plausibly be projected over the next 30-60 years (A3) and suspected over a period of 30-60 years including both the past and the future (A4), with the causes uncertain, continuing, and quite possibly irreversible, again in either instance based on any or all of (a) to (e). Evidence for A4c is probably the strongest since a precautionary interpretation of life history data indicates a period of 60 years for three generations, which encompasses the dramatic effects of the Farakka Barrage completed in 1974, as well as at least 19 other barrages and 18 high dams constructed in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) and Karnaphuli-Sangu (KS) systems since 1957, and the projected dramatic declines in the area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and quality of habitat that will undoubtedly occur if the proposed Ganges-Brahmaputra inter-link canal and dam project, and projects planned under the Indian National Waterways Act 2016, intended to convert 111 reaches of 106 rivers to inland waterways for transport of cargo, coal, and industrial raw materials, and tourism) are completed as planned. The cumulative effects of these projects, together with ongoing mortality from entangling fishing gears, imply a probable population size reduction of more than 50% for the Ganges subspecies from 1957-2017. Even though the number of dolphins in the Sukkur-Guddu segment (and possibly also the Guddu-Taunsa segment) of the Indus River may have increased following a hunting ban in the early 1970s (see above), this could have been partly or largely due to one-way immigration from upstream (the return movements having been substantially impeded by barrages). Also, the decline in overall subspecies distribution in the Indus system continues with extirpation of more subpopulations (e.g., Beas River and Jinnah-Chashma subpopulations) and further range decline is ongoing. Equally, the major changes in the Indus caused by water development since the turn of the last century have reduced the dolphins’ area of occupancy by about 80%, reduced the overall carrying capacity for dolphins in the Indus basin, and caused a substantial net decline in population size. Thus, it is reasonable to infer declines of at least 50% in the populations of both subspecies. <br/> <br/> <strong>Criterion B</strong>. It has not been possible to estimate the extent of occurrence or area of occupancy for the entire species because the potential total range of the Ganges subspecies is so large and poorly documented. Nevertheless, the aggregate population of Ganges Dolphins has been severely fragmented, and there is great uncertainty about their continued occurrence in many parts of that potential range. The Indus subspecies qualifies as EN under this criterion as: (a) its extent of occurrence is estimated at only about 900 km², compared with the EN threshold of 5,000 km², (b) its population is severely fragmented and it occurs at more than five locations (defined as inter-barrage segments of river), and (c) a continuing decline can be inferred or projected in the quality of its habitat. Although the total populations of both subspecies are severely fragmented and the quality of their habitat continues to deteriorate, it would be difficult to demonstrate that the extent of their aggregate occurrence is less than 5,000 km².</p><p> <strong>Criterion C</strong>. Although it is possible that the total number of mature individuals is less than 2,500, current information from field surveys does not allow this criterion to be credibly applied. If future population assessments ultimately indicate that the population meets the &lt;2,500 threshold, then it would qualify under subcriterion C1 because a continuing decline of at least 20% can be expected over the next 20–40 years (see ""Threats"" and ""Conservation Actions"").</p>  <strong>Criterion D</strong>. The population size is greater than 250 mature individuals, so this criterion does not apply.<br/> <br/> <strong>Criterion E</strong>. No quantitative analysis of extinction probability has been attempted for this species.","<p>South Asian River Dolphins are generally concentrated in counter-current pools below channel convergences and sharp meanders and above and below mid-channel islands. Annual monsoon-driven flooding causes great variability in the dolphins’ access to large parts of their range. Isolation in seasonal lakes or deep river channels sometimes occurs, as does ""escapement"" from the rivers into canals and reservoirs. Deltaic (brackish) waters are a component of the total range, but Ganges Dolphins are not generally known to occur in salinities greater than 10 ppt.</p><p>Ganges Dolphins are generally concentrated in counter-current pools below channel convergences and sharp meanders (Smith 1993, Smith<em> et al.</em> 1998) and above and below mid-channel islands, bridge pilings, and other engineering structures that cause scouring. Several studies have demonstrated that Ganges Dolphins are concentrated into deep pool habitat in the dry season, which increases their conflict with fisheries that also concentrate in these productive areas (Kelkar<em> et al.</em> 2010, Bashir<em> et al.</em> 2012). Their fidelity to counter-current pools is probably greatest in fast-flowing channels. Isolation in seasonal lakes sometimes occurs (especially in the Brahmaputra basin). Deltaic (brackish) waters are a major component of the total range of this subspecies, but the animals are not generally known to occur in salinities greater than 10 ppt, although they have been observed in waters as saline as 23 ppt.</p>  <p>Indus Dolphins generally occur in the deepest river channel and are less common in secondary channels and small braids (Braulik 2006). During the low-water season (October to April), barrages divert almost all river water such that dolphin habitat downstream of Sukkur Barrage and in some tributary segments has been eliminated and so have the dolphins. As water levels drop in the winter, dolphins are concentrated in the remaining deep areas, including the head ponds upstream of barrages. A comprehensive habitat study demonstrated that Indus Dolphins selected locations in the river with significantly greater mean depth, maximum depth, cross-sectional area, and hydraulic radius, and significantly narrower river width and a lower degree of braiding than areas where dolphins were absent (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2012). Channel cross-sectional area was the most important factor affecting dolphin presence and abundance, with the area of water less than 1 m in depth exerting the greatest influence. Indus Dolphins avoided channels with small cross-sectional area (&lt;700m<sup>2</sup>), presumably owing to the risk of entrapment and reduced foraging opportunities.</p>  <p>Male South Asian River Dolphins attain sexual maturity at a body length of about 170 cm and physical maturity at 200-210 cm. Females attain sexual maturity at similar or slightly larger body lengths but physical maturity at about 250 cm. The generally larger rostrum of females accounts for this sexual dimorphism. Length at birth is estimated to be about 70 cm. Gestation lasts approximately one year, with possible peak birthing seasons in early winter and early summer. Young begin feeding on small prey at about one or two months and are weaned within a year (Kasuya 1972). Brownell (1984) estimated age at sexual maturity to be roughly 6-10 years in this species. </p>","<p><strong>Water development projects</strong> such as dams and irrigation barrages (diversion dams) have dramatically affected the habitat, abundance, and population structure of this species throughout its range. Barrages and dams are physical barriers that isolate dolphins into small sections of river, fragmenting the population. In addition to fragmentation, dams and barrages have degraded downstream habitat and created impoundments with high sedimentation and altered assemblages of fish and invertebrate species. Canals branching from the river channels upstream of barrages represent population ""sinks"", as dolphins enter them with little or no prospect of safe return; this problem has been especially well documented in Pakistan. More dams and barrages are either under construction or in advanced planning stages. Water diversion and use in the South Asian subcontinent, including intra- and inter-basin transfers, will continue to be driven principally by the escalating demands for water from agriculture, industry, and municipalities; by strategic considerations; and by the need to control flooding. The range of the South Asian River Dolphin will probably continue to decline as subpopulations are extirpated due to habitat loss related to escalating water demands, large engineering structures (e.g., high dams, barrages, and embankments), and long-term climate changes (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2010, Chaudhary<em> et al.</em> 2012, Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p><strong>Pollutant loads</strong> in South Asian rivers are increasing and can be expected to continue to do so with industrialization and the spread of intensive agricultural practices facilitated by irrigation with river water. The capacity of these rivers to dilute pollutants (e.g., arsenic, DDT, industrial effluents) and salinity has already been drastically reduced because of upstream water abstraction, diversion, and impoundment. Again, this problem is bound to worsen as more development takes place and with few controls on pollutant discharges. <br/></p><p> <strong>Deliberate killing</strong><strong> </strong>of River Dolphins has declined in many areas but still occurs at least occasionally. Dolphins are hunted by tribal people in the upper Brahmaputra for their meat and by fishermen in the middle reaches of the Ganges for their oil, which is used as a fish attractant.<br/> <br/> <strong>Mortality in fishing gear</strong>, especially gillnets, is a severe problem for Ganges Dolphins throughout most of their range and is an increasing problem for Indus Dolphins. They are particularly vulnerable because their preferred habitat is often in the same location as the fishing grounds (Kelkar<em> et al.</em> 2010).<br/> <br/> More specific information on the subspecies is provided below:<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Ganges Dolphin</strong></em><br/> Construction of at least 50 dams and barrages within the known or historical range of the Ganges Dolphin (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2000) has dramatically affected its habitat, abundance, and population structure. The subspecies exists as a metapopulation, with numerous subpopulations isolated to varying degrees by mostly manmade barriers, as described above. In addition to fragmenting dolphin populations, dams and barrages degrade downstream habitat and create small reservoirs (known as head ponds (or pondage in India) in the case of barrages) with high sedimentation and altered assemblages of fish and invertebrate species. For example, luxuriant growth of macrophytes and excessive siltation have eliminated suitable habitat immediately above Farakka Barrage (Sinha 2000). Low flows downstream of Farakka barrage have also allowed salt water to intrude an additional 160 km into the Sundarbans Delta, further decreasing the amount of suitable habitat for this obligate freshwater dolphin.</p>  <p>A high dam has been planned for some time just upstream of the dolphins' current (or at least recent) range in the Karnali River, Nepal. If built, this structure would almost certainly eliminate the small amount of dolphin habitat in Nepal’s last river with a potentially viable dolphin population (Smith and Reeves 2000). Disturbance and environmental degradation associated with geotechnical feasibility studies and bridge and road construction for the dam already may have contributed to a decline in the number and range of dolphins above the Nepal-India border (Smith 1993, 1994). Another high dam has been proposed for the Surma River in Cachar, India, which would certainly affect dolphins downstream in the Kalni-Kushiyara distributary.<br/> <br/> Since the 1980s, momentum has been growing within India to proceed with large-scale inter-basin water transfer projects, which will involve additional dam construction and diversion of water from rivers inhabited by dolphins. This has been proposed for many years but is gaining momentum and plans are being solidified to make this a reality. Several key categories of potential threat are: (a) further fragmentation of the dolphin metapopulation, (b) reduction or elimination of habitat simply in terms of dry-season flow, (c) ""escapement"" of dolphins into canals where they are unlikely to be able to get back into rivers and are therefore doomed, (d) cascading effects from interrupted migrations of prey </p>  <p>organisms, degradation of prey spawning habitat etc., (e) contaminant flux leading to significant changes in chronic and/or acute exposure to toxins, (f) loss of complexity (channelization, sediment entrapment upstream of dams, etc.) making the rivers less habitable for dolphins and (g) downstream effects on the ecology of the delta (e.g., saline encroachment, loss of sediment). A related initiative is a series of projects planned under the Indian National Waterways Act 2016. This initiative has raised concerns regarding the possible negative impacts of these developments and the associated lack of water, capital dredging, construction of additional barrages, increased vessel traffic, and pollution. </p>  <p>Embankments cause sediments to be deposited in the riverbed instead of on the floodplain, thereby eliminating or reducing the extent of the eddy counter-currents where dolphins are generally found (Smith<em> et al.</em> 1998). They also restrict access to floodplain habitat critical to the reproduction and growth of riverine fish species. Approximately 3,500 km of embankments have been constructed in the Ganges mainstem and the Gandak, Buri Gandak, Bagmati, Kamala, Yamuna, and Son tributaries (Mishra 1999). Dolphins were apparently extirpated from at least 35 km of the Punpun tributary of the Ganges after embankments were constructed in 1975 (Sinha<em> et al.</em> 2000). </p>  <p>Other sources of habitat degradation in the GBM system include dredging (Smith<em> et al.</em> 1998) and the removal of stones (Shrestha 1989), sand (Mohan 1989), and woody debris (Smith 1993). These activities compromise the ecological integrity of the riverine environments, especially small tributaries where suitable habitat is limited and disproportionately vulnerable to local disturbance. Although the long-term implications of reduced dry-season flows in the Ganges are catastrophic for the survival of both River Dolphins and a major portion of the world’s human population that inhabits the Ganges basin, minimum flow requirements to maintain ecological integrity have only been superficially assessed and even if minimum flows were prescribed in principle or in law, there is little prospect of their being implemented. Meanwhile, new projects to divert dry-season flow, such as Kanpur Barrage in the upper Ganges, continue to be constructed (Sinha<em> et al.</em> 2000). <br/> <br/> Organochlorine and butyltin concentrations in samples from the tissues of Ganges Dolphins were high enough to cause concern about effects (Kannan<em> et al.</em> 1993, 1994, Kannan 1997, 2005; Senthilkumar<em> et al.</em> 1999). Pollutant loads can be expected to increase with industrialization and the spread of intensive agricultural practices. River Dolphins may be particularly vulnerable to industrial pollution because their habitat in counter-current pools downstream of confluences and sharp meanders often places them in close proximity to point sources in major urban areas (e.g., Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Calcutta, and Dhaka). Furthermore, the capacity of rivers to dilute pollutants (e.g., arsenic, DDT) and salts has been drastically reduced in many areas because of upstream water abstraction, diversion, and impoundment. Again, this problem is bound to worsen as more development takes place. <br/> <br/> Deliberate killing of River Dolphins is believed to have declined in most areas but still occurs at least occasionally in the middle Ganges near Patna, India (Sinha<em> et al.</em> 2000, Smith and Reeves 2000), in the Kalni-Kushiyara River of Bangladesh (Smith<em> et al.</em> 1998), and in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River in Assam, India (Wakid 2009). Dolphins are killed by tribal people in the upper Brahmaputra for their meat and by fishermen in the middle reaches of the Ganges for their oil, which is used as a fish attractant. <br/> <br/> Mortality in fishing gear, especially gillnets, is a severe problem for Ganges Dolphins throughout most of their range. From 2007 to 2013, 13 of 40 documented deaths in the eastern Sundarbans, Bangladesh were a result of entanglement in fishing gear (10 in gillnets, 2 in longlines, and 1 in a set bag-net), 2 of vessel strikes, 2 of directed killing, and the rest of unknown causes (Mansur<em> et al.</em> 2014). Although Ganges Dolphins appear somewhat resilient to changes in fish community structure from overfishing (Kelkar<em> et al.</em> 2010), fatal entanglements, particularly in gillnets, will undoubtedly increase with growing demands on freshwater fisheries. In the middle Ganges, although harpooning is now ""rare"", mortality in fishing nets remains ""widespread"" (Sinha 2002). A specific problem is that, because dolphin oil is highly valued as a fish attractant, fishermen have a strong incentive to kill any animals found alive in their nets and even to set their nets strategically in the hope of capturing dolphins (described by Sinha 2002 as ""assisted incidental capture""). Meaningful quantitative data on the magnitude of catches, either deliberate or incidental, are unavailable and unlikely to become available in the absence of a well-organized, adequately funded, and incorruptible fishery/wildlife management system.<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Indus Dolphin</strong></em><strong><br/> </strong>The most significant threat to dolphins in the Indus has been the construction of the Indus basin irrigation system that has severely fragmented the population and reduced the amount of available habitat. Since the 1880s, 19 irrigation barrages have been constructed on the lower Indus within, or at the limits of, the former range of the dolphins. Dolphins have now been extirpated from approximately 80% of their former range because many of the rivers are now dry (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2014). &#160;The dolphin range decline is a dynamic process and it is probable that both the Beas River and the Jinnah-Chashma dolphin subpopulations have been extirpated within the last five years. Low dry-season river discharge, due to water extraction at irrigation barrages is the principal factor responsible for both the temporal and spatial pattern of the dolphins' range decline (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2014). Reductions in flow affect dolphins directly by reducing the physical space available to them, reducing average water velocity and depth and increasing water temperature. During the dry season Indus Dolphins are concentrated in the remaining deep pool habitat in the river, and they avoid shallow river sections (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2012). Removal of water from the river exacerbates and concentrates anthropogenic threats, for example, by increasing the concentration of nutrients and pollutants, and forcing the dolphins to congregate in deep pools that are also important areas for fishing, thereby increasing the chances of negative interactions with humans.</p>  <p>It has been suggested that dolphins sometimes move through barrage gates and between subpopulations (Reeves<em> et al.</em> 1991). The only solid evidence of this is from a single radio-tracked dolphin released above Sukkur Barrage during canal closure that traversed the barrage</p>  <p>in both upstream and downstream directions several times (Toosy<em> et al.</em> 2009). The barrage gates were eventually closed, leaving the animal below the barrage, trapped in a new subpopulation downstream from its origin. The potential implications of large-scale movements of animals through barrages are great. If animals are more likely to move downstream than upstream, the result would be the gradual attrition of upstream subpopulations and the augmentation of those downstream. Migration of this type could dramatically deplete upstream subpopulations over time, especially as many of these are already very small, potentially leading to their gradual extirpation (Reeves<em> et al.</em> 1991). </p>  <p>Pollution may be affecting the viability of the Indus subspecies, especially considering the decline in flushing and dilution due to reduced flows and increasing industrial effluent discharges. More than 75% of the dolphin population occurs downstream of the confluence with the Panjnad River, which receives a large pollution load from the industrialized cities of the Punjab. There are almost no facilities for treatment of municipal waste in Pakistan and few controls on industrial effluent. Massive fish kills from industrial pollution have reportedly become common in urban areas, and also human deaths from contact with toxic industrial discharges, not to mention increasing runoff of pesticides used on irrigated crops grown along the riverbanks. Commonly used pesticides – DDT, Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin and Endosulfan – were found in the tissue of three Indus Dolphins that died in Sukkur in January 2011 (WWF-Pakistan 2011). The pressures on river water supply and continued untreated discharge of pollutants imply that there will be a continuing decline in the amount and quality of dolphin habitat, and similar to Ganges River Dolphins, Indus Dolphins are likely to be exposed to very high levels of toxic contaminants that could compromise health. <br/></p><p> Deliberate killing for meat and oil was a traditional and widespread practice until at least the early 1970s (Pilleri and Zbinden 1973-74). The Indus Dolphin became a protected species in the early 1970s and within a few years, and following some prosecutions in the courts, dolphin hunting largely ceased (Bhatti and Pilleri 1982).</p>  <p>Indus Dolphins are accidentally captured in nets when they stray into irrigation canals which, due to their narrow and shallow dimensions, are easily and heavily fished. Net entanglement is a major concern between Sukkur and Kotri barrages where the Indus flow is so severely depleted that fixed nets span the river. However, in general, the Indus River main channel has not been intensively fished as fishing activity is concentrated in side channels and adjacent pools that are reported to be warmer and have higher fish densities. However, entanglement is an increasing threat as boats become mechanised and better able to negotiate the main channel. In 2007, changes in fishery management led to larger numbers of fishermen using the river and a coincident jump in the number of dolphin deaths. From 1993 to 2010 a total of 35 dolphins were reported dead between Guddu and Sukkur, however in 2011 alone 45 dead dolphins were reported and another 15 from January to May 2012, with similar monitoring systems present in each year (Waqas<em> et al.</em> 2012). In 2011 at least six dolphins were killed when insecticides were dumped into the river to increase fish catch, a practice that is increasingly common (WWF-Pakistan 2011). </p>","<p>Published data on abundance consist primarily of uncorrected counts conducted within discrete portions of the vast network of riverine and deltaic habitat occupied by these dolphins. Few rigorous estimates of absolute abundance, with measures of precision, are available. Combining current knowledge on abundance from the Indus and Ganges we make an educated guess that the entire species numbers less than 5,000 individuals of all ages. More specific information on each of the subspecies is provided below:<br/> <br/> <strong>Ganges Dolphin</strong><br/> In the Sundarbans of Bangladesh, concurrent double-platform visual surveys in 2002 resulted in an abundance estimate of 225 Ganges Dolphins (CV=12.6%) and an encounter rate of 0.47 individuals/linear km, with Irrawaddy Dolphins (<em>Orcaella brevirostris</em><em>)</em> replacing <em>Ganges Dolphins</em> in higher-salinity waters of the southern and western portions of the delta (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2006). No information is available on the status of Ganges Dolphins in the Indian Sundarbans, except for historical reports of occurrence (Anderson 1879, Jones 1982). &#160;In 65 km of the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary on the Ganges, Kelkar<em> et al.</em> (2010) estimated Ganges Dolphin abundance as 179 (SE=7, 95% CI 148–208) and 270 (SE=8, 95% CI 240–304) in the mid and peak dry seasons, respectively. At the far upstream extent of their distribution, an estimated 37-42 dolphins remain in the Karnali, Sapta Koshi, and Narayani Rivers in Nepal (Paudel<em> et al.</em> 2015). In southern Bangladesh, at least 125 dolphins occurred in the Karnaphuli and Sangu Rivers in 1999 (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2001), and 197 were counted in the Brahmaputra River in 2005 (Wakid 2009).</p>  <p>The highest encounter rates of Ganges Dolphins have been observed in the Ganges mainstem between Maniharighat and Buxar (1.6/km) (Sinha and Kannan 2014); and within this segment, particularly in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary in the lower Ganges (3.3/km; (Chaudhary<em> et al.</em> 2012), 1.13/km in the middle reaches of the Gandak River, and 1.4/km in the lower Sangu River, Bangladesh (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2001). An encounter rate of 0.23 dolphins/km was recorded in the entire Brahmaputra River (Wakid 2009). </p>  <p>Compiling direct counts and abundance estimates from numerous surveys by different groups over approximately the last ten years, Sinha and Kannan (2014) tabulated a total of 3,526 individuals for the Ganges River subspecies. However, it is not clear how accurate this is because the various researchers cited did not follow consistent and robust methods and at least some of the counts are likely to be negatively biased. In addition, many tributaries north of the Ganges River, such as Mahananda, Mechi, Bagmati, Kamala, Balan, and Burhi Gandak, have not yet been surveyed, of which Mahananda and Bagmati are large rivers (Sinha and Kannan 2014). Similarly, the Indian portion of the Sundarbans Delta and some large and many small rivers in Bangladesh have not been assessed, so the true total could be much higher.<br/> <br/> Although no credible time series of abundance estimates is available for most of the subspecies' range, survey data imply downward trends in a number of the upstream tributaries.<br/> <br/> <strong>Indus Dolphin</strong><br/> The entire current range of the Indus subspecies was surveyed in a coordinated manner in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2017 (Braulik 2006, Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2012, Noureen 2013) and all surveys resulted in estimates of well under 2,000 individuals for the entire subspecies. All surveys consisted of direct counts by three observers from a viewing platform on an oar-powered wooden vessel travelling downstream along a thalweg transect, and in 2006, 2011, and 2017, direct counts were conducted from vessels travelling in tandem, separated by 1 km, and mark-recapture methods were used to correct for groups that were missed, resulting in higher point estimates of abundance along with measures of precision (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2012, Noureen 2013). The abundance estimates in all four surveys were similar, ranging between 1,200 and 1,800 individuals for the entire subspecies. The largest and most important subpopulation is located between Guddu and Sukkur barrages in northern Sindh. This 190 km river section supports approximately 70% of all Indus Dolphins, at encounter rates approaching 10 individuals/km. Dolphin encounter rate and subpopulation abundance decline in each river section as one proceeds upstream (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2015).</p>  Between Guddu and Sukkur barrages, the dolphin counts increased from 138 in 1974 (Pilleri and Zbinden 1973-74) to 902 in 2008 and showed a statistically significant exponential rate of increase of 5.65% per year (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2012). The lack of confidence intervals on these counts means that firm conclusions about population growth rates cannot be made; however, all surveys indicate that there has been some increase in the Guddu to Sukkur subpopulation since the 1970s. The increase could be explained by recovery of this subpopulation after implementation of a hunting ban in 1974 (see Conservation Actions), perhaps supplemented by permanent immigration from upstream subpopulations (see Threats). A comprehensive review of previous survey data is presented in Braulik<em> et al.</em> (2015).",Unknown,"<p>This species occurs in the Indus, GBM, and KS river systems of the South Asian subcontinent, from the deltas upstream to where movement is blocked by rocky barriers, shallow water, fast currents, dams, or barrages (low, gated diversion dams). The three river systems are disjunct and therefore so are their respective dolphin subpopulations, although there may be occasional demographic interaction between the latter two during the high-water season if the freshwater plumes of the two systems meet. There is further subpopulation separation within the Indus and GBM systems, some of it natural but much of it caused by physical barriers (dams and barrages) constructed within the last 100 years.<br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>P. g. minor</em> (referred to throughout this document as the Indus Dolphin) is endemic to the rivers of the lower Indus basin in Pakistan and India. Historically it occurred in the Indus mainstem and the Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum tributaries from the Indus delta upstream to the Himalayan foothills (Anderson 1879). The historical range of Indus Dolphins has been fragmented by barrages into 17 river sections. Dolphin sighting and interview surveys showed that dolphins have been extirpated from ten river sections, persist in six sections and are of unknown status in the section of the Sutlej River on the India-Pakistan border (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2014). The linear extent of occurrence is now approximately 1,000 km (Braulik 2006) and approximately 99% of the dolphin population occurs in only 690 km of river, which corresponds to an almost 80% reduction in effective linear range since the 1870s (Reeves 1991). Current occupancy is effectively limited to three subpopulations in the Indus mainstem located between the Chashma and Taunsa, Taunsa and Guddu, and Guddu and Sukkur Barrages with only a handful of animals remaining above and below these sections (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2012). A tiny (&lt;30 animals) remnant subpopulation occurs in the Beas River in India (Khan 2016).</p>  <p>The range of the Ganges subspecies (Ganges Dolphin) has declined progressively since the nineteenth century when it was mapped by Anderson (1879). Historically it occurred through several thousand kilometres of free-flowing river in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and possibly Bhutan. The downstream effects of at least ten dams and barrages constructed in the Ganges mainstem and tributaries have severely reduced and fragmented dolphin habitat (Smith and Reeves 2000). Dolphins have undergone roughly a 100 km decline in their range in the Ganges River since the late 1800s, and disappeared from the upper Ganges between Haridwar and Bijnor, and Narora and Kanpur. Historically, they were found year-round in the Yamuna River approximately 400 km upstream to Delhi (Anderson 1879), but in recent years, dolphins have not been reported in this river above the Chambal River confluence during the dry season because upstream channels have become too shallow and polluted to support dolphins (Sinha 2000). In the northern Ganges tributaries, of the six dolphin subpopulations that were isolated above or between barrages, three have been extirpated (in the Gandak River above the Gandak Barrage, in the Sarda River above the upper and lower Sarda barrages and the Sone River) (Sinha<em> et al.</em> 2000) and one has been reduced to insignificant numbers (in the Kosi River above the Kosi Barrage) (Smith 1994, Sinha and Kannan 2014). &#160;A few Ganges Dolphins were still present during the mid-1990s as far downstream in the Hoogly River as Kakdwip (Sinha 1997), and more recent surveys suggest their continued presence between Farraka and the Bay of Bengal in West Bengal, India (Chowdhury <em>et al. </em>2016). The lack of adequate of water being released downstream of Farraka Barrage has eliminated dry-season habitat for more than 300 km, or until the Ganges (Padma)-Brahmaputra confluence in Bangladesh (Smith<em> et al.</em> 1998).</p><p>Occasional reports of dolphins in the reservoir behind Kaptai Dam (built in 1961) of the KS system occurred until the mid-1990s (Ahmed 2000), but surveys in the late 1990s found no evidence that any Ganges Dolphins survive there (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2001). Thus, the dam's construction likely caused a substantial reduction in the subspecies’ range in southeastern Bangladesh, but the absence of any historical information on occurrence in the upper Karnaphuli makes any quantitative estimate of range reduction impossible </p>  <p>Dolphins are expected to have been extirpated from the Subansiri River because of periodic dramatic declines in river discharge from the newly completed Lower Subansiri hydroelectric project (Baruah<em> et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>The map produced by Sinha and Kannan (2014) shows where the species occurred as of that time </p>","<p>The Ganges subspecies is hunted locally for food, and to extract oil which is used as a fish attractant. The Indus Dolphin is no longer used by humans or for trade.</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>The species is legally protected in all range states and occurs in a number of national parks and other designated areas, including dolphin reserves or sanctuaries, where at least nominal enforcement takes place. In Pakistan, the enforcement of regulations prohibiting dolphin hunting appears to have arrested a rapid population decline in the Indus during the early 1970s. Also in Pakistan, a program exists to rescue dolphins trapped in irrigation canals and return them to the Indus main channel. Although sample sizes were limited, trials in India to determine the effectiveness of shark and scrap fish oils as catfish attractant were judged provisionally successful, but it is unclear to what extent fishermen have converted to using them instead of dolphin oil.<br/> The species is listed on CITES Appendix I.<br/> <br/> Ganges Dolphins are legally protected from hunting in all range states. The Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bihar, India, between Sultanganj and Kahalgaon in the mainstem of the Ganges River was designated as a protected area for dolphins in August 1991 but there is little government support to enforce protective measures. The designation of the Ganges Dolphin as the National Aquatic Animal and the development of a Ganges Dolphin Conservation Action Plan (Sinha<em> et al.</em> 2010) were positive steps forward in their conservation which had been previously described as ""completely ineffective,"" however it remains unclear if these steps have actually improved on-the-ground protection (Sinha 2002). Declaration of three small wildlife sanctuaries to protect Ganges Dolphins in key hotspots within the Sundarbans Delta of Bangladesh was an important step in their conservation. In a few smaller tributaries, dolphins receive nominal protection by virtue of the fact that small portions of their habitat are within or adjacent to national parks and sanctuaries (e.g., Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India; National Chambal Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, India; and Royal Bardia National Park and Katerniya Ghat Gharial Sanctuary, respectively north and south of the Nepal-India border).</p><p> In 1972, Indus Dolphins were protected under the Wildlife Act of Sindh and in 1974 the government of Sindh declared the Indus River between the Sukkur and Guddu Barrages a dolphin reserve. The government of Punjab prohibited deliberate killing of dolphins in the Punjab Wildlife Protection Act in 1974 and established the Taunsa Wildlife Sanctuary and Chashma Wildlife Sanctuary in 1983 and 1984, respectively (Chaudhry 1989, Reeves<em> et al.</em> 1991, Reeves and Chaudhry 1998). Enforcement of regulations prohibiting dolphin hunting appears to have arrested the rapid population declines reported by Pilleri and Zbinden (1973-74) for these river segments. A long-term programme to rescue dolphins trapped in irrigation canals and return them to the Indus mainstem has had good success in reducing mortality.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008). It is reportedly present in at least 29 Chinese Nature Reserves (Mallon 2002, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jutzeler <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010, <span class=""A8"">Dhendup<em> et al. </em>2019).</span></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Required Conservation Actions</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Implimentation of conservation action plan (Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019).</li><li>Confirm occupancy in protected areas within the species EOO, and extend to confirm occupancy in suitable habitats predicted using distribution models. </li><li>Establish a suitable and quantifiable monitoring method for the species.</li><li>Identify and implement population monitoring in key areas that have potential to indicate the species status at a wider scale. </li><li>Identify regions where human caused threats endanger Pallas’s Cat and implement mitigation measures.&#160; </li><li>Recommend new protected areas in Pallas’s Cat hotspots not currently protected. </li><li>Increase collaboration between Pallas’s Cat researchers to validate and refine population distribution and habitat distribution models.&#160; </li><li>Understand the species population dynamics in relation to potential prey population cycles in areas where we know large population fluctuations occur (such as the Daurian steppe).
