544742,14018,Mustela lutreola,Critically Endangered,A3ce,2012,2011-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"European regional assessment: Critically Endangered (CR) A3ce<br/>EU 27 regional assessment: Critically Endangered (CR) A3ce<br/><br/>This species is listed as Critically Endangered for Europe and the EU 27 region due to an ongoing population reduction. In the last three generations this is inferred to have resulted in the loss of over half the population, and it is predicted to intensify in the next three generations to result in a decline rate exceeding 80% over the next 10 years due to habitat degradation/loss and the effects of introduced species.","European Mink have specialised habitat requirements. They are semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of rivers, streams and sometimes, during warm seasons, they may inhabit lake-banks. It is rarely found more than 100 metres away from freshwater. There are no records of its presence at the sea coast.<br/><br/>They hunt both in riparian zones and in the water for amphibians, crustaceans (crayfish), fish, small mammals, insects and birds (Sidorovich <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998; Maran <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998; Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2008). Females become mature for the next breeding season at 11 months (Maran unpublished).","The decline and extinction of the European Mink cannot be explained with a single universal factor. The main factors operating the extinction have been (1) habitat loss, (2) over-exploitation and (3) impact of alien American Mink.<br/><br/>In the European continent, human activities have resulted in large-scale alteration of landscapes, which has had a substantial impact on various habitats and their species. The European Mink has proved to be sensitive to human-induced environmental change and disturbance. As the type and extent of human influence on the species and its biotope has varied over time and between regions in Europe, the set of factors contributing to the extinction has varied as well.<br/><br/>Several factors have often been acting in concert with a cumulative effect. The course of decline during the first half of the 20th century in central regions of Russia is a perfect illustration to this. There, the effect of over-exploitation was noticed almost throughout the entire European Mink range (this even resulted in a moratorium of hunting in several regions and even in reinforcement efforts in Jaroslav Region, where around 130 European Mink were translocated with the hope to recover the original, depleted population). In addition, extensive change of habitats in the mid-20th century further contributed to the decline. Thereafter, the invasion of the American Mink posed a very serious threat to the native mink. Large-scale introduction of American Mink in Russia, first planned to be conducted only in regions outside the European Mink's natural range, were ultimately performed also inside the native mink range. The reason for this was twofold: (1) the original mink has become too scarce for the fur-trapping industry, (2) higher value of American Mink fur in the market (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). It is important to note that in these times the American Mink and European Mink were not regarded by the relevant authorities to be two distinct species. In the course of the introduction operation, 20,400 American Mink were released in the USSR until 1971, with around 4,000 of them being released into the range of the European Mink (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). The intentional introduction of the alien species was strongly supported by rapidly developing mink fur-farming in the former Soviet Union – escapees from farms formed a continuous source of new founders for introduction. American Mink farming started in the 1920s; in 1972, 1.9 million female American Mink were kept in fur-farms and in 1973, 4.9 million mink were raised in 146 farms in the former Soviet Union (Abramov 1974). As the native mink populations were small and highly fragmented by over-exploitation and habitat loss, the fur-farm escapees, being ecologically more flexible (Maran 1991) easily invaded into the freely available ecological niche, thus making it impossible for the depleted European Mink to recover. Even more, the remaining European Mink groups were an easy target for intra-guild aggression (Maran <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991, 1998; Sidorovich <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, 2001). The magnitude of the effect of mink farming on the native mink is well illustrated by a recent study in Denmark (a country with a very high number of mink farms), which concludes that 86% of free-living American Mink are escapees from farms (Hammershoj <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>Local key factors have changed with time also in many other countries. For instance the impact of over-hunting and/or habitat change weakened the populations and accelerated the impact of the subsequent spread of the American Mink and/or the impact of other factors. It might well be that sometimes the interchange of key factors in time and/or the concurrent impact of several factors has led to a synergistic effect on the European Mink. Further, the time from the introduction of the threat to the extinction of the species can be highly variable, resulting in the so-called extinction or decline lag (Baillie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). This, along with the interwoven effect of numerous factors, is likely to result in situations when it is hard or, in some cases, even impossible to identify the actual causes behind the extinction process.<br/><br/>The role of the alien American Mink deserves a special attention. Its role has been noted in several reports as a secondary or not at all important factor, usually emphasizing that the decline of the European Mink started before the invasion of American Mink (Lodé 2002, Lodé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Rozhnov 1992, Schubnikova 1982). Still, there are several records about local extinction of the European Mink concurrent with rapid expansion of the American Mink, e.g., in Estonia, Tver Region in Russia, Basque country (Zadorra river basin and northern Bizkaia) in Spain, Belarus (Cena <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003; Katchanovsky 2002; Maran 1991; Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2004; Sidorovich 1991, 1993). Further, although there are “time-shot” records on the co-existence of the two mink species, no records demonstrating long-term sympatric coexistence of the two mink species have been traced. Numerous records reveal the local replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink, but no opposite events have been reported. Records on replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink are further supported by studies of behavioural interactions between the two mink species in the wild and well as in experimental conditions. All this evidences that the American Mink has played a special role in the demise of the European Mink. While most of the other agents which have been operating the extinction are relatively easy to stop by conventional conservation management, there is very little one can do to prevent the spread of the alien American Mink. This means that the presence of the American Mink in wide territories across Europe makes the efforts for species recovery a very complicated task.<br/><br/>In addition to the main factors behind the decline of European Mink populations, a number of other factors may pose a local threat to the remaining small populations, like hybridization, road casualties, Aleutian disease, secondary poisoning etc.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is still a serious threat especially in the western population, both in France and in Spain (mostly in Cantabric rivers).","Its range has reduced by over 85% since the mid-19th century. The remaining population is small, fragmented and declining. The most viable population in Western Europe is in the Danube Delta. The current European Mink range in Russia consists of isolated distant habitat patches of different size. These fragmented populations are scattered across western Russia, the Urals, and the northern Caucasus. The only parts of the range where the American Mink is absent are rivers in the Archangelsk Region and Komi and probably also in Northern Caucasus. Everywhere else the populations of European Mink are vanishing or becoming increasingly fragmented and localized. The Russian population of European Mink has been estimated at <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ca</span>. 20,000 (Tumanov 2003, 2006), but this is not based on quantitative data as no large-scale census has been done. Hunting bags suggest that the European Mink is rapidly becoming less abundant by comparison with the American Mink: for instance, in Vologda and Kostroma regions the proportion of European Mink skins in the hunting bag of the two mink species decreased from 50–70% to 1–10% within the last 5–7 years (to 2006). For the whole of Russia, recent records refer only to the capture of single individuals or to local populations consisting of some ten of individuals (Skumatov and Saveljev 2006). The number of 20,000 mink in Russia seems to be an extensive overestimate of present population size.<br/><br/>Due to the intensive American Mink control measures during last decade the population in Spain (in Mediterranean basin) is quite stable. Still, remarkable fragmentation has been observed in its range in the north (Basque Country) and the population disappears because of the American Mink. At the same time, a slight expansion of the range to south and southeast has been observed in Aragon in the Ebro River basin (Gomez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press).<br/><br/>The overwhelming majority of remaining populations are in decline and of low density. Therefore the size of the species' range leads to overestimation of the population status. It is likely that the overall number of mink has declined more than 90% since the beginning of the 20th century. Also, the presence of the American Mink in most of range fragments confuses the reports and makes the status projections to the future rather pessimistic.<br/><br/>Some national estimates of population abundance:<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spain</span>: 500–1,000 individuals (Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">France</span>: several hundred (S.

Libois pers. comm. 2006).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Danube </span>Delta: since 2003 until 2010 a total of 70 European Mink were life captured in the Romanian part of the delta; trapping success changed dramatically between years, the best year was 2010 with 24 mink captured. Hence for the last decade there are no signs of decline, neither in range nor in number as far as the Romanian part of the Danube Delta and adjacent lagoons in the south are concerned (A. Kranz pers. comm. 2006).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Belarus</span>: the species is considered to be extinct in former two small range fragments (Sidorovich pers comm. 2011).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ukraine</span>: the European Mink was recently re-discovered in Danube and Dniester deltas (de Jongh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Russia</span>: in most of the country, in 61 regions (subcountry units) within the species historical range it is extinct or believed to be extinct (40 regions, 66%). In seven regions that species is known to be extant, and in nine regions it is believed to still  survive. From those, only for 12 regions the European mink is expected to survive for longer than 10 years. The American Mink is now present within the whole remaining range of the European Mink, though may be absent or very low in numbers in Northern Caucasus and in the north - approximately 64°–66°N, 44°–52°E (near Timanskiy kriazh, to Polar ring).</li></ul>",Decreasing,"The historical range of the European Mink extended from Finland to east of Ural Mountains, to northern Spain and Caucasian Mountains (Novikov 1939, Heptner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1967, Youngman 1990, Maran 2007). The relatively recent discovery of mink in France (1839) and in eastern Spain (1951) suggests late expansion of the species to the west (Youngman 1990, Michaux <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, over the last 150 years it has severely declined and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range (Maran 1999, Maran 2007 and references therein).<br/><br/>The current range consists of few isolated fragments: in northern Spain and western France, in Danube delta in Romania, in the Ukraine and Russia (Maran 2007 and references therein). It occurs from sea level to 1,120 m (Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/>The species is still extant in only a minor part of its former range and is in decline even in its currently remaining range enclaves. Only Romania and Vologotsk Region and Arkhangelsk Region can, perhaps, be regarded as exceptions. In Romania, the presence of the European Mink in Danube Delta was confirmed relatively recently (Gotea and Kranz 1999). The European Mink seems to be still widespread there. Repeated live-trapping surveys since 2001 indicate that mink inhabit the area of no more than 2,500 km² (e.g., Kranz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). In Vologodsk Region, considering the rapid decline of the species in the neighbouring regions and the presence of the American Mink, it is not likely that the European Mink populations will hold there for long. In the Arkhangelsk Region, the population seems to exist in the northwest of the region, which is close to the northern limit of the range with very low abundance of the species. The presence of the American Mink (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neovison vison</span>) is likely to pose a serious threat to its long-term existence also there (Skumatov 2005, Maran 2007 and references therein).","<p>The species was largely used in fur trade during the first half of the 20th century. At present, there is no data on trade. The higher quality of farmed American Mink fur makes it highly unlikely that the trading could become an issue in European Mink conservation.&#160;&#160; </p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is legally protected in all range states (Schreiber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1989).

New studies have been launched to study reproductive physiology, impact of captive conditions, options for artificial insemination, effect of behavioural personality types in mink to conservation breeding and reintroduction. There is an urgent need for a species action plan in the European Union for European Mink for better collaboration between different ongoing conservation activities.  Clearly national and regional authorities need to increase attention and allocate sufficient and continued resources for European Mink conservation, otherwise this species will disappear soon. There is a need for large-scale coordinated efforts to secure the survival of the last small remaining populations in different areas inside of the historical range of the species, but also restoration and/or establishment of new populations is required.<br/>Conservation breeding of the species needs all-European coordination so that all single-country initiatives collaborate. Current tendency for isolated one-country breeding efforts will lead to ineffective use of resources and of competence, but also to inability to reach the captive population size sufficient enough to maintain genetic diversity in captivity. For remaining <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in situ</span> populations, the maintenance or restoration of sufficiently large areas of suitable habitats has to be secured by designation of new protected areas and improvement of management of existing protected areas. <br/><br/>The impact of the American mink on local European Mink populations has to be monitored and controlled, and whenever possible and feasible the alien mink populations should be removed. Local authorities have to pay more attention to the effects of the American Mink on the local fauna, including the European Mink. They should support further studies and actions to mitigate the effect of alien mink to the native mink species. For example, intensive control of American Mink is ongoing in Spain since 2001. More than 3,000 American Minks have been eradicated around and inside the European Mink distribution area. It is likely that without such a control of alien mink the native mink population in Spain would have vanished already (Gomez and Palazon pers. comm.).<br/><br/>For French and Spanish wild populations which appear to be highly inbred further research needs to be carried out to identify whether these seemingly genetically highly uniform populations suffer from inbreeding depression. The introduction of individuals from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> stock from genetically diverse eastern populations has to be considered as a potential conservation measure, if further research confirms the need for this. In addition to genetic studies, comparative studies on ecology and behaviour of the disjunct mink populations (Spanish/French, Romanian and eastern European) should also be conducted to support the findings of genetic studies. The <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ </span>conservation breeding program has to be enhanced and promoted, as it guarantees the survival of the species in case <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in situ</span> efforts temporarily fail. It also provides opportunities for the restoration of already vanished wild populations and reinforcement of existing populations whenever needed. Better coordination between different <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> actions over political borders is needed. Special studies have to be conducted to find the most feasible way to incorporate the western low-variability populations into the joint program with high-diversity eastern population.&#160; <br/><br/>There is also a need for developing an all-European conservation breeding program with secured long-term funding. Further studies are needed about the current status of the European mink in Romania, Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern parts of Europe.",Palearctic,,false,false,Europe
3343205,12419,Lutra lutra,Near Threatened,,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Near Threatened at the regional level due to an ongoing population decline, but at a rate that does not exceed 30% over the past 3 generation (criterion A2). 

The picture is complicated in the Mediterranean region because in some southern European
countries the species is recovering, whereas in other range states (especially in North Africa and the Near East) it continues to decline at least in some
areas. The assessment of Near Threatened is precautionary; it acknowledges that the recovery in parts of Europe is genuine and that the conservation actions for this species need to be sustained. ","The Eurasian otter live in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas independent of their size, origin or latitude (Mason and Macdonald 1986). In Europe they are found in the brackish waters from the sea level up to 1,000 m in the Alps (Ruiz-Olmo and Gosalbez 1997) and above 3,500 m in the Himalayas (Prater 1971) or 4,120 m in Tibet (Mason and Macdonald 1986). In the Indian sub-continent, the Eurasian otters occur in cold hill and mountain streams. During summer (April - June) in the Himalayas they may ascend up to 3,660 m. These upward movements probably coincide with the upward migration of the carp and other fish for spawning. With the advent of winter the otters come down to lower altitudes (Prater 1971). In a study conducted in Thailand in Huai Kha Khaeng where the Eurasian, smooth-coated and small-clawed otters live sympatrically, Kruuk <em>et al</em>. (1994) found that the Eurasian otters used rapidly flowing upper parts of the river. In Sri Lanka the Eurasian otter was live in the headwaters of all the five river systems but not in the estuaries (de Silva 1996).<br/><br/>In most parts of its range, its occurrence is correlated with bank side vegetation showing importance of vegetation to otters (Mason and Macdonald 1986). Otters in different regions may depend upon differing features of the habitat, but to breed, they need holes in the river bank, cavities among tree roots, piles of rock, wood or debris. The Eurasian otters are closely connected to a linear living space. Most portion of their activity is concentrated to a narrow strip on either side of the interface between water and land (Kruuk 1995). Otter distribution in coastal areas especially the location of holts, is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater (Kruuk <em>et al.</em> 1989, Beja 1992). <br/><br/>Within the group home range, shared by resident adult females, each had her own core area. Resident males had larger home ranges in more exposed parts of the coast which overlapped with other males and with at least two female group ranges. Male and female transients moved through group ranges, relegated to less favoured holts, habitat and food. In freshwater home ranges are longer for both sexes (Kruuk 1995). Erlinge (1969) suggested that males were hierarchical and territorial, influenced by sexual factors, while female ranges were influenced by food and shelter requirements of the family group. Green <em>et al</em>. (1984) and Kruuk (1995) found that adult males spent most of their time along the main rivers, whereas adult females occupied tributaries or lakes, as they did in Austria (Kranz 1995). Rosoux (1995) found no sexual differences in habitat utilization and considerable overlaps in range. Young animals usually occupied peripheral habitat, but Green and Green (1983) found differences between immature and mature young males, the later having access to all available habitat and the other restricted to marginal habitat, supplemented by visits to the main river when vacant, temporally or spatially. While males generally have larger ranges than females in the same habitat, sizes vary according to the type and productivity of the habitat, and methods of measuring ranges vary from study to study. <br/><br/>Like most <em>Lutra</em> species, fish is the major prey of Eurasian otters sometimes exceeding more than 80% of their diet (Erlinge 1969, Webb 1975, Ruiz-Olmo and Palazon 1997). In addition to fish a whole range of other prey items have been recorded in their diet in variable proportions. These include aquatic insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, small mammals, and crustaceans (Jenkins <em>et al</em>. 1980, Adrian and Delibes 1987, Skaren 1993). In a study conducted in Sri Lanka, Silva (1996) reported that the overall diet of the Eurasian otters consisted of 81.2% of crab, 37.5% fish and 8.7% frog. In addition to these the diet also included small quantities of water snakes, birds, small mammals and insects. <br/><br/>The percentage of crab in the diet of the Eurasian otters in Sri Lanka varied from 72% to 85%, and fish from 25-31%. There was significant seasonal variation in the diet in different habitats. The relative importance of fish in the diet was significantly higher in the reservoirs and lakes than the rivers and streams. Crabs were more important to otters inhabiting streams than those inhabiting rivers and lakes. Crabs were eaten more than fish during the monsoon (de Silva, 1997).  However, in Huai Kha Kheng, Thailand 76% of the spraint had fish, 64% amphibians and 7% crab (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994). The Eurasian otter is capable of taking fish as large as 9 kg (Chanin 1985), however, many studies in Europe have revealed that the fish consumed by the Eurasian otters are relatively small with a median length of 13 cm (Kruuk 1995).<br/><br/>The Eurasian otter is largely solitary and the adult otters tend not to associate with other adults except for reproduction. The family group of mother and offspring is the most important unit of otter society. In Shetland, where several adult animals used the same stretch of coast, encounters between adults were rare (Kruuk 1995) and the species was strikingly non-social. Kranz (1995) found evidence of social group formation beyond the occasional associations of two or more family groups, which suggests that under some circumstances otters of all ages and sexes may form temporary mutually tolerant gatherings.<br/><br/>In most of its range the Eurasian otter is predominantly nocturnal (Green <em>et al</em>. 1984). The exception is Shetland, where otters were entirely diurnal (Kruuk 1995). Green <em>et al</em>. (1984) found that activity was largely circumscribed by the solar rhythm so that the duration of activity varied through the year with night length. The reverse situation was found in Shetland with activity restricted by the day length (Kruuk 1995). Some workers have found a break in activity in the middle of longer nights or days and single peak around midnight or midday in shorter nights or days, although up to four activity periods per night has been recorded. Kruuk (1995) links otter activity to that of prey species, with the favoured marine species more vulnerable in daylight and those in freshwater easier to catch at night. In coastal habitats, tidal patterns influence otter activity, with significant preference shown for feeding at low tide, both in Shetland and on the Scottish west coast (Kruuk 1995).<br/><br/>The Eurasian otter attains sexual maturity at around 18 months in males and 24 months in the case of females, but in captivity it is usually 3 to 4 years (Reuther 1991). They are non-seasonally polyoestrous (Trowbridge 1983), mating in captivity has been observed at all times of the year (Reuther 1999). The gestation period is approximately 63-65 days, the litter size varies from 1 to 5, and the life expectancy is around 17 years (Acharjyo and Mishra 1983).","The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalisation of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, draining of wetlands, aquaculture activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). In South and South East Asia, the decrease in prey species from wetlands and water ways had reduced the population to an unsustainable threshold leading to local extinctions. The poaching is one of the main cause of its decline from South and South East Asia, and possibly also from the North Asia.<br/><br/>Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilisers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry. <br/><br/>In addition, major causes of mortality from range countries are drowning and road kills. Fyke nets set for eels or for fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans have a great attraction to otters and a high risk to those that successfully try to enter these traps. <br/><br/>A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor, 2004).<br/><br/>There is an ongoing discussion about the problem of reintroduction of otters. In recent years it is feared that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population (Mason 1992, Reuther 1998).","In spite of several studies, the status of its population is not known from many parts of its range, particularly from Africa and Asia. The overall estimate of the population in United Kingdom was 10395 individuals in 2004 (JNCC 2007). The status of its distribution has been reviewed by Conroy and Chanin (1998) which gives a complete picture of its occurrence, though information on its abundance is lacking in this review. As far as its abundance is concerned limited information is available so as to get a clear picture of its status. In Shetland, otters averaged 1/km of shore, but each otter used several, overlapping km of shore. An estimated nine adult female produced a mean of total 5.6 litters/year. The estimated juvenile female per 100 female attaining the first reproduction was 33.7 individuals in Shetland (Kruuk <em>et al.</em> 1989). In central Finland between 1985 and 2003 the temporal and spatial variation in the density of otter population was 52 otters, including 16 cubs in 11 litters in an area of 1,650 km² in 2002-2003. Harris <em>et al.</em> (1995) estimated the density of otters in England as one adult per 27 linear km of river (1/24 km in the ""high density"" area of Scotland. However, such information is lacking from other range countries. There is absolutely no information about its population status from Asia where it is believed to be under tremendous pressure because of poaching.",Decreasing,"The Eurasian otter has one of the widest distributions of all Palaearctic mammals (Corbet, 1966). Its range covers parts of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. Its current distribution in Europe is marked by a large corridor, reaching from Central Denmark, via the Western parts of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Eastern parts of France, Switzerland, the Western pmts of Austria to Central Italy, where the otter is extinct or reduced to small and sometimes isolated populations. Information for Russia, which forms a link between Europe and Asia, is fragmented. It seems that the otter is distributed throughout the country with the exception of the tundra and the northern regions with permanent frost. The southern border of the Eurasian otter's range in the Near and Middle East is formed by Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Iran. It is also reported from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in Africa in the north of Sahara. In south Asia the species has been reported from all most all the countries especially from Himalayan River systems of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and eastward throughout South East Asia up to Japan where it believed to be extinct. <br/><br/>There are several open questions for the Southeast Asian region. It seems that the Eurasian otter reached the island of Sumatra but, did not reach the island of Java. Conroy <em>et al.</em> (1998) are not sure if the evidence of otters on the island of Borneo really relates to the Eurasian otter. Its occurrence has been confirmed from South Korea, Southern China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Bangladesh (Lekagul and McNeely, 1988, Hussain 1999). In India it occurs in Northern, North East and from Southern India. Formerly widely distributed in Japan, it is now believed to be extinct (Ando <em>et al</em>. 2007). Once widespread in the rivers of northern Mongolia (Mallon 1985), along the rivers of Mongol Altai Mountain Range, and along the Halh River in Ikh Hyangan Mountain Range (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1970; Sokolov and Orlov 1980). It has also been reported from downstream of the Tengis River in northern parts of Hövsgöl Mountain Range (Tsagaan 1975; 1977) and around the Eröö River Basin in western Hentii Mountain Range (Tsendjav 2005).

However, if conservation actions for the species were stopped or reduced, the species would very quickly move back into a threatened category. Hence the Near Threatened listing is a precautionary one based on Criterion A3 and A4, as it is suspected that if conservation measures ceased, declines over a 12 year (=3 generation) period in the future, or including both the past and the future, might approach 30%.","It is known from a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas. It is very adaptable, using saltwater as well as freshwater habitats, and even sewerage systems in urban areas. In most parts of its range otter distribution is correlated with presence of riverbank vegetation. Otters in different regions may depend upon different features of the habitat, but the important component of otter habitat, for breeding purposes, is the presence of holes in the river bank, including cavities among tree roots, piles of rock, wood or debris. The Eurasian otter avoids deep water. Their distribution in coastal areas is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater. The location of breeding holts is not confined to river banks; there is evidence to indicate that sometimes the species breeds well away from water and the pups are moved to holts on the river banks once they are a few months old (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).","The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalisation of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, abstraction of water for irrigation, draining of wetlands, agricultural activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations. Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilisers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry. In addition, major causes of mortality from several countries are drowning, road kills, and poaching. Fyke nets set for eels and other fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans are very attractive to otters, and many that try to enter these traps are entangled and drowned. A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). Illegal killing for the trade of pelts is on the increase in Ukraine and Danube Delta, and probably in the eastern parts of its global range (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006).","Expanding throughout most of its European range following historic declines up until the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; although in the European part of Russia there have been recent marked declines, and isolated populations in countries like Turkey, Italy, Georgia, Armenia are still declining. The UK population started to recover in the 1960s (Battersby 2005). The population in Portugal is stable and did not show much decrease historically (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Norway, although the range is increasing on the south-western coast, the population appears to have declined again since the mid 1990s (T. Heggberget pers. comm. 2006).",Unknown,"The Eurasian otter has the widest distribution of all otter species. Its range covers parts of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. Originally the species was widespread throughout Europe, but it declined dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, and has disappeared from parts of central and northern Europe (it is probably extinct in Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, and Switzerland: Prigioni 1999). It is not found on most of the Mediterranean islands due to the lack of appropriate habitat, although it is found on Corfu (Greece). Little is known about the original distribution in Africa and Asia. Otters have been found in brackish waters below sea level in the Netherlands, and up to 2,400 m in the Pyrenees. Outside Europe they have been recorded up to 4,120 m in Tibet (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).",,Terrestrial,"It is strictly protected under international legislation and conventions: CITES Appendix I (Reservation by Russian Federation), Bern Convention Appendix II, EU Habitats and Species Directive Annexes II and IV, and EC 338/97 Annex A.

Monitoring programmes have been established in many range states in Europe. Road barriers and tunnels under roads are required to reduce the impact of road kills (especially in countries like Germany where road kills are the main threat). Much more monitoring is required, but also better survey techniques are required. For example, the population on the Shetlands is well-surveyed, and survey results show no indications of decline, but evidence from other sources (breeding holts, changes in diet, etc.) indicate that declines are in fact happening (J.

It is difficult to quantify population trend, but it seems reasonable to suspect an overall decline, based on the data gathered by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (LCIE 2007). There is unlikely to be any significant rescue effect because populations are fragmented and isolated.","Throughout Europe and Siberia, lynx are associated primarily with forested areas which have good ungulate populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Central Asia lynx occur in more open, thinly wooded areas. The species probably occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the treeline. On the better-forested southern Himalayan slopes, there are only a few records from Nepal (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Karan Bahadur Shah pers. comm. 2008).  Lynx occur sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau, and are found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Eurasian lynx is the largest lynx, and the only one to primarily take ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller prey where ungulates are less abundant (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In European Russia and western Siberia, where roe deer are absent, mountain hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base. Hares and birds are important prey also in other Central Asian regions where habitats are dryer and less forested (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).  Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smallest ungulate species in the community (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Home range size varies widely (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), but averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland's Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 1997).

Populations in central and southern Europe are small and fragmented, although there are larger populations in Fennoscandia and the Baltic states (Breitenmoser <em>et al.</em> 2000). Lynx in Europe occur in ten distinct subpopulations (IUCN 2007).  Detailed status and trend information can be found on www.kora.unibe.ch/en/proj/elois/online/index.html (ELOIS, the European Lynx Online Information System).<br/><br/>The lynx's stronghold is a broad strip of southern Siberian woodland stretching through eastern Russia from the Ural mountains to the Pacific, and the Russian lynx population has been estimated at 30,000-35,000 (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).  Although large portions of its range lie in China, status there is poorly known, and the government considers the population to be decreasing in a recent global survey of lynx status (Govt of US 2007).  While lynx presence in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia is uncertain, in the country of Mongolia Matyushin and Vaisfeld (2003) estimate the lynx population at 10,000.<br/><br/>In a survey of 37 lynx range state governments, 30% considered their national populations to be decreasing, 35% stable, 14% stable to slightly increasing, 16% increasing, and 8% unknown (Govt of US 2007).  The population in Afghanistan is considered to have decreased (Habibi 2004).",Decreasing,"The Eurasian lynx has a very broad distribution from western Europe through the boreal forests of Russia, and down into central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).

It was also absent from the Iberian Peninsula, where the smaller Iberian lynx <em>Lynx pardinus</em> occurs. Lynx have been extirpated from most of western Europe. In central Europe, they survive only in the Carpathian Mountains and a small area of the south Dinaric Mountains in Greece, Macedonia and Albania, although larger populations persisted in Fennoscandia, the Baltic states, and European Russia.

This assessment refers only to the isolated population in Spain and France. The French population is declining rapidly. In Spain the overall number of European mink is decreasing, and the species is disappearing from rivers in the north and centre of its range, although a concurrent slight extention of the range to the east has been observed (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). The rate of decline has not been quantified, but an 80% reduction in the past ten years seems reasonable. The species could well become extinct in France in the near future, but probably not in the next ten years.","European mink have specialised habitat requirements. They are semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of lakeshores, rivers, streams and marshlands, and are rarely found more than 100 meters away from fresh water. They forage at night, hunting both on land and in water for a wide range of animal prey including small mammals, birds, frogs, molluscs, crabs, fish and insects (Youngman 1990, Maran 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Females become mature at 19 months (Youngman 1990).","Habitat loss and degradation is a serious threat to the European mink. Ongoing destruction and degradation of freshwater and associated terrestrial habitats is caused by by<em> inter alia</em> hydroelectric developments, channelisation and water pollution. Accidental trapping is also a threat, even though the fur of the European mink is less valuable than that of the American mink <em>Neovison vison</em>. In France, secondary poisoning and trapping of European mink has occurred as a result of efforts to control coypu (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>) and small carnivores (e.g. polecat). Accidental mortality through vehicle collisions is a problem in some areas, and small remnant populations may be driven extinct by threats such as predation by feral dogs and accidental mortality in fish traps (T. Maran pers. comm. 2006). Competition and direct aggression from the American mink is a further threat to depleted remnant populations (Maran 1999). The Aleutian disease could also have an impact, but diseased animals have not yet been found. In Spain and France, hybridization with <em>Mustela putorius</em> may be a threat (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2000).","Since the mid-19th century, this species has undergone dramatic declines throughout its range, and is now extinct in most European countries. It now occupies less than 20% of its original range, and the remaining population is small and fragmented and continues to decline (Maran 1999). Recent population estimates include 500-1,000 individuals in Spain (Palazon <em>et al.</em> 2003), several hundred individuals in France (Fournier and Maizeret 2003, Stephane Aulagnier and Roland Libois pers. comm. 2006), and <1,000 individuals in the Danube Delta (A. Kranz pers. comm. 2006). In Ukraine, at the beginning of the 21st century, the population was estimated at 350-400 individuals, with the majority of those found in the Danube Delta (>200 individuals) (Volokh 2004). The most viable population in western Europe is that of the Danube Delta, but even this population may be rapidly declining: in 250 trap nights (2006) only one animal was caught, compared to one in 20 nights in 2003 (A. Kranz pers. comm. 2006). Other viable populations are found in the northeastern part of European Russia.<br><br>The current European mink range in Russia consists of isolated distant habitats of different size. These fragmented populations are scattered across western Russia, the Urals, and the northern Caucasus. The only parts of the range where the American mink is absent are rivers in the Archangelsk Region and Komi. Everywhere else populations of European mink are vanishing or becoming increasingly fragmented and localised, and in a greater part of historical range in Russian the European mink is not met any more. The Russian population of European mink has been estimated at c.20,000 (Tumanov 2003, 2006), but this is not based on quantitative data as no large-scale census has been done. Hunting bags suggest that the European mink is rapidly becoming less abundant by comparison with the American mink: for instance, in Vologda and Kostroma regions the proportion of European mink skins in the hunting bag of the two mink species decreased from 50-70% to 1-10% within the last 5-7 years (to 2006). For the whole of Russia, recent records refer only to the capture of single individuals or to local populations consisting of some ten of individuals (Skmatov and Saveljev 2006).",Decreasing,"<em>Mustela lutreola</em> is largely restricted to Europe. A century ago it was widespread throughout the continent, with a distribution extending from northern Spain in the west to the river Ob (just east of the Urals) in the east, and from the Archangelsk region in the north to the northern Caucasus in the south (Youngman 1990). However, over the last 150 years it has severely declined and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range (Maran 1999). The current range includes an isolated population in northern Spain and western France, which is widely disjunct from the main range in Eastern Europe (Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, central regions of European Russia and the Danube delta in Romania). It occurs from sea level to 1,120 m (Palazon <em>et al.</em> 2003).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Legally protected in all range states (Schreiber <em>et al.</em> 1989) including the Russian Federation (Alexei Tikhonov pers. comm 2006). At least part of the population occurs within protected areas. Studies have been undertaken to determine the mink's ecological requirements, to analyse the causes of its decline, and to assess the genetic variability of western populations. In Spain and France programmes have been started to control the American mink population. A captive breeding programme was launched in 1992 by the European Zoo Association (the Catalonian Government's captive breeding programme is part of this European initiative). Efforts are being made to reintroduce European mink to areas where they formerly occurred in Germany and the Russian Federation. An introduction programme is underway on the island of Hiiumaa (to Estonia) in the Baltic, where the American species has been excluded. In France a national action plan for the conservation of the European mink was initiated by the Ministry of Environment and has been coordinated by the SFEPM (French Mammal Society). <br/><br/>Conservation needs vary throughout Europe, and include the following:<br/>·National and regional authorities need to increase attention and allocate sufficient resources for European mink conservation. Otherwise this species will disappear soon.<br/>·There is a need for large-scale efforts to secure the survival of the last small remaining populations in different areas inside of the historical range of the species, but also restoration and/or establishment of new populations is required. <br/>·For remaining <em>in situ</em> populations, the maintenance or restoration of sufficiently large areas of suitable habitats has to be secured by designation of new protected areas and improvement of management of existing protected areas. <br/>·The impact of the American mink on local European mink populations has to be monitored and controlled, and whenever possible and feasible the alien mink populations should be removed. Local authorities have to pay more attention to the effects of the American mink on the local fauna, including the European mink. They should support further studies and actions to mitigate the effect of alien mink to the native mink species. <br/>·Aleutian diseases and other pathologies must be monitored in all remaining <em>in situ</em> populations of the European mink. <br/>·For French and Spanish wild populations which appear to be highly inbred further research needs to be carried out to identify whether these seemingly genetically highly uniform populations suffer from inbreeding depression.  The introduction of individuals from <em>ex situ</em> stock from genetically diverse eastern populations has to be considered as a potential conservation measure, if further research confirms the need for this. In addition to genetic studies, comparative studies on ecology and behavior of the disjunct mink populations (Spanish/French, Romanian and eastern European) should also be conducted to support the findings of genetic studies.  <br/>·The <em>ex situ</em> conservation breeding program has to be enhanced and promoted, as it guarantees the survival of the  species in case in situ efforts fail. It also provides opportunities for the restoration of already vanished wild populations and reinforcement of existing populations whenever needed. <br/>·There is a need for developing an all-European conservation breeding program with secured long-term funding.<br/>·Further studies are needed about the current the status of the European mink in Romania, Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern part of Europe.",Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean
4494371,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Not Applicable,,2007,2007-02-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is a vagrant in the marine region covered by the European Mammal Assessment, consequently it is classed as Not Applicable.","Walruses are highly gregarious animals and are frequently found in close knit groups that regularly number in the tens to many hundreds, and aggregations of animals including many groups of these sizes can number in the low thousands.  Walruses also haul out on ice floes and beaches on islands or remote stretches of mainland coastlines forming dense groups of animals lying pressed together and on top of one another. At sea, walruses can be found alone or in large aggregations.<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occurs in the winter. It is believed that walruses are polygynous, the males forming a type of lek, or establishing small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes. Males have an unusual adaptation for producing bell-like sounds underwater. A pair of elastic pharyngeal pouches in the neck can be inflated with air to serve as resonance chambers that make this unique sound. There is also intense male-male fighting at this time. Tusks are used for interspecific aggression, defense against predators, which include polar bears and killer whales, and for aids in hauling-out on ice, but not for digging up food. <br/><br/>Walruses are one of the largest pinnipeds.  Males reach about 3.6 m and 880-1560 kg, females about 3 m and 580-1039 kg.  Newborns are 1-1.4 m and weigh 33-85 kg. Although females can ovulate at four years of age, the majority do not give birth until they are 7-8 years old and usually only produce one calf every three years. Gestation lasts 15 months, including a delay of implantation time of 3-3.5 months. The period of calf dependency is long, regularly taking two years, and can extend longer if a female does not give birth every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>Walruses are primarily bottom feeders and shallow divers. Most prey taken is found in the upper few centimeters of sediment, or on or just above the bottom. A wide variety of benthic invertebrates, with several species of clams, make up the majority of food for most animals. Their diet also includes other species of mollusks, and many species of worms, snails, soft shell crabs, amphipods, shrimp, sea cucumbers, tunicates, and slow-moving fish. Some individuals regularly prey on seals, small whales, and seabirds, and occasionally scavenge marine mammal carcasses (Fay 1982).","All three walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th  through the mid-20th centuries. Native people of the Arctic have depended on walruses for food, hides, ivory, and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests of all three subspecies continue today in most parts of their ranges. <br/><br/>Direct conflicts with fisheries are low; however trawl fisheries can disturb important benthic feeding area (Born 2003).  Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights, and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on walruses out of the water, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance, and easily panicked into stampedes. Fay and Kelly (1980) documented an instance of a mass mortality of approximately 1,000 animals from a stampede event at Saint Lawrence Island. The cause of the stampede is unknown; however this mass mortality event underscores the risks of any source of disturbance to aggregations of hauled-out walruses.    <br/><br/>Global warming and any associated reduction in the extent, timing, and characteristics of seasonal sea ice cover could negatively effect walrus populations. Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregation, and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Moore 2005). In contrast Stirling and Derocher (1993) suggest that climatic warming could result in more favorable conditions for bearded, harp, and harbor seals and walruses if it causes sea ice to become less consolidated in winter, and the summer open water period to lengthen. <br/><br/>Reduction in sea ice could also lead to the addition of commercial sea lanes in rarely visited portions of the walruses’ range, with increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants, disturbance, and coastal development (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Tynan and Demaster 1997, Moore 2005).","The Pacific walrus population recovered from a depleted state in 1950 to historical high levels in the 1980s (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The population was estimated at over 230,000 in 1985 (Gilbert 1989), and 201,000 in 1990 (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 1992). However, difficulties with associated with conducting these surveys greatly reduced the precision of these estimates (Gilbert 1999). The current population level is unknown (Angliss and Lodge 2004). The Atlantic walrus has been extirpated from some areas but estimates are that between 10,000 and 19,000 animals occur from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the Kara Sea (Born <em>et al.</em> 1995, Kastelein 2002). The Laptev population was estimated at 4,000-5,000 animals according to a report cited in Fay (1982), and the current status is unknown. The walrus is a vagrant in the marine region covered by the European Mammal Assessment.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution. The Pacific subspecies is found in the Bering and Chukchi Seas to the East Siberian Sea in the west and the western Beaufort Sea in the east. The Atlantic subspecies occurs in numerous subpopulations from the Eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea, including the Barents and White Seas, and Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. Vagrants have been reported from Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay. The Laptev walrus is confined to the Laptev Sea north of central Russia.  All three subspecies of walruses are found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas, and rarely occur in deeper waters (Scheffer 1958, Fay 1982, Rice 1998, Kastelein 2002).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Coastal Alaska Natives have hunted walruses for subsistence purposes in the United States under an exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection Act since 1972.  No quotas or limits have been established, but all animals taken are required to be harvested in a non-wasteful manner. Quotas on harvest have been imposed in Canada and in the Russian Federation. Walrus hunting in east Greenland has been banned and is regulated in other areas of Greenland.

5325996,15951,Panthera leo,Regionally Extinct,A2abcd,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Lions are extinct in the Mediterranean region, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s.","The lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer in press).  Although lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills. <br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting.  Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g.,  from 266-4,532 km²  in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001), and 20,500 km² in the Serengeti (West and Packer in press). <br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic lion is dry deciduous forest.  The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock.  Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic lion's diet, although the most common prey is the chital deer.  Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The main threats to lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect life and livestock) and prey base depletion.  Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of populations becoming small and isolated (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that each lion cost ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-lion conflict (Frank <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for providing financial resource for lion conservation for both governments and local communities.  However, there is concern that current management regimes can lead to unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Disease has also been a threat to lion populations (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by lions, with up to 400 human lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda 2007).","There have been few efforts in the past to estimate the number of lions in Africa. Myers (1975) wrote, ""Since 1950, their [lion] numbers may well have been cut in half, perhaps to as low as 200,000 in all or even less"". Later, Myers (1986) wrote, ""In light of evidence from all the main countries of its range, the lion has been undergoing decline in both range and numbers, often an accelerating decline, during the past two decades"". In the early 1990s, IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group members made educated ""guesstimates"" of 30,000 to 100,000 for the African lion population (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>The most quantitative historical estimate of the African lion population in the recent past was made by Ferreras and Cousins (1996), who developed a GIS-based model to predict African lion range and numbers, calibrated by surveying experts about the factors affecting lion populations. First they correlated vegetation (Leaf Area Index) with lion densities, using known values from 37 studies in 19 African protected areas, and mapped potential lion range. Then the reduction effect of human activities on lion range and numbers were estimated. Lion experts were surveyed in order to develop and rank a set of factors which would lead to lower lion densities as well as lion absence. These included agriculture, human population density, cattle grazing, and distance from a protected area, and were derived from GIS databases of varying age. For example, in areas identified as main cattle grazing areas lion density was reduced by 90%, and in areas identified as having widespread agricultural cultivation or high human population density (&gt; 2.5 people/km²) Lions were considered absent. Lion density was reduced by 50% in areas with low human population density (1-2.5 people/km²). Because of the age of their data sources on extent of agriculture and pastoralism, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) selected 1980 as the base year for their predicted African lion population of 75,800. They emphasized the need for ground-truthing their estimate by censusing lions, particularly outside protected areas.<br/><br/>Two recent surveys have provided current estimates of the African lion population, with some ground-truthing. The African Lion Working Group, a network of specialists affiliated with the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group, conducted a mail survey and compiled estimates of 100 known African lion populations. Not included were populations of known existence, but unknown or unestimated size. The ALWG African lion population estimate is 23,000, with a range of 16,500-30,000 (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). The second survey was carried out by Philippe Chardonnet and sponsored by the International Foundation for the Conservation of Wildlife and Conservation Force (Chardonnet 2002). He also compiled estimates for 144 individual African lion populations, grouped into 36 largely isolated subpopulations. His methodology included extrapolation of estimates of known populations into areas where lion status was unknown, and his total figure is not surprisingly larger: 39,000 lions in Africa, with a range of 29,000-47,000.<br/><br/>Approximately 30% of the individual population estimates compiled by the African Lion Working Group were based on scientific surveys. Techniques for these surveys included total count based on individually identified body features, sampling by use of calling stations playing recordings of hyaena and/or lion prey, and mark-recapture methods including radio telemetry, photo databases, and spoor counts (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). Seventy percent of their population figures were derived from expert opinion or guesstimate. In the other survey, 63% of Chardonnet's (2002) individual population estimates were based on expert opinions or guesstimates. Twelve percent of Chardonnet's (2002) estimates were based on scientific surveys, and a further 25% were derived from extrapolation of variables from nearby populations and catch-per-unit effort-estimates based on lion trophy hunting.<br/><br/>Estimating the size of the African lion population is an ambitious exercise involving many uncertainties. The three main efforts (Ferreras and Cousins 1996; Chardonnet 2002; Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004) all use different methods. The African Lion Working Group compiled individual population estimates primarily from protected areas (23,000 lions: Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). In 1980, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted 18,600 lions to occur in protected areas. This was probably an underestimate as not all protected areas inhabited by lions at that time were included. Still, the comparison suggests that the number of lions in African protected areas has remained stable or possibly increased over time. But Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted that most lions in 1980 were found outside protected areas. Chardonnet (2002) finds that unprotected areas still comprise a significant portion (half) of the lion's current African range. Comparison of Ferreras and Cousin's (1996) prediction of 75,800 lions in 1980 (roughly three lion generations ago) to Chardonnet's (2002) estimate of 39,000 lions yields a suspected decline of 48.5%. This calculation suggests a substantial decline in lions outside protected areas over the past two decades. Ferreras and Cousins (1996) may have over-estimated the African lion population in 1980, as their number was derived from a model rather than actual lion counts, and so it is possible that the rate of decline of the African lion population may be lower.  A group exercise led by WCS and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group estimated that 42% of major lion populations were declining (Bauer 2008).  The rate of decline is most unlikely to have been as high as 90%, as reported in a series of news reports in 2003 (Kirby 2003, Frank and Parker 2003).<br/><br/>Genetic population models indicate that large populations (50-100 lion prides) are necessary to conserve genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding, which increases significantly when populations fall below 10 prides.  Male dispersal is also an important factor in conserving genetic variation (Bjorklund 2003).  These conditions are met in few wild lion populations, although there are at least 17 lion ""strongholds"" &gt;50,000 km² in extent (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> occurs as an isolated single wild population in India's Gir Forest.  The Gir lion population had been reduced to a very low number in the early years of the 20th century, possibly fewer than 20.  In 1936, 234 lions were estimated, falling to approximately 100 iin the 1970s, and estimates in the 1980s and 1990s around 200 adults (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In 2005,  the population was estimated at 359, +/- 10, including cubs, based on, according to the Chief Minister of Forests for Gujarat state, a total count of lions by direct sighting in a block-system methodology.  This is an increase from 327 reported in 2001 (Anon. 2006).  The Wildlife Protection Society of India reported 34 lion deaths in 2007, due to poaching, electrocution, falling into open wells, and death by motor vehicle and unknown causes.  Single populations are vulnerable to extinction from catastrophic events, and it has long been recommended by scientists to establish a second wild population in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, but this has not yet been done (Jackson 2008).  The Asiatic lion shows reduced genetic variation due to small population size (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 1987).  It is feared that the size of the population is larger than the estimated carrying capacity of the habitat and prey base (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",,"Lions are found in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  In 2005-2006 the Wildlife Conservation Society and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map and assess current lion range in sub-Saharan Africa (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008).  Extent of occurrence is estimated at over 4.5 million km², 22% of historical range.  Most lion range is in eastern and southern Africa (77%).  Current lion status is still unknown over large parts of Africa, 7.6 million km².  <br/><br/>The lion formerly ranged from northern Africa through southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Today, the only remainder of this once widespread population is a single isolated population of the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer in press).",,Terrestrial,"<em>P. leo</em> is included in CITES Appendix II; the Critically Endangered Asiatic lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> is included in CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Africa, lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for lions in west and central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and eastern and southern Africa (IUCN 2006b).  The West and Central African Lion Conservation Strategy focuses on three primary objectives to address threats that directly impact lions:  to reduce lion-human conflict, and to conserve and increase lion habitat and wild prey base.  The objectivs of the Eastern and Southern African Lion Conservation Strategy are aarticulated around the root issues in lion conservation, including policy and land use, socio-economics, trade, and conservation politics.  For example, the policy and land use objective is ""to develop and implement harmonious and comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks that provide for the expansion of wildife-integrated land use, lion conservation and associated socio-economic benefits in current and potential lion range.""  The trade objective is ""to prevent illegal trade in lions and lion products while promoting and safegarding sustainable legal trade.""  Both regional strategies share common priorities of conserving and restoring lion populations, improving managemetn capacity, and increasing the flow of benefits to communities living with lions.  These strategies should be used by governments to guide national lion action plans, policies and programs, and by the conservation community to guide their project development.  By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>For the Asiatic lion, resolving human lion-conflict is a high priority, as well as establishing a second wild population (Jackson 2008).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

However, the introduction of <em>Scuirus carolinensis</em> and <em>Calosciurus finleysonii</em> to Italy is a concern. The red squirrel populations here need to be closely monitored and action taken quickly if populations show continued declines or introduced species are shown to widen their ranges.","It is most abundant in large tracts of coniferous forest and also occurs in deciduous woods, mixed forest, parks, gardens, and small stands of conifers.

Now that the grey squirrel has become established on the continent, it can be expected that it may ultimately spread throughout much of the red squirrel's range. Grey squirrels not only out-compete the smaller red squirrels, but also carry parapox virus, which is highly pathogenic to red squirrels. Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected, and recent (2006) UK studies have shown that 61% of apparently healthy grey squirrels have been exposed to the virus and may be carriers (C. McInnes <em>in litt.</em> 2006). When the virus is present, the grey squirrel can replace the red squirrel 20 times faster than normal replacement rate (Rushton <em>et al.</em> 2006).

Typical densities range from less than 0.1 to 1.5 individuals per hectare (Gurnell and Wauters 1999). However, it is sufficiently common in some parts of its range that it is considered a forestry pest owing to its habit of stripping bark and feeding on conifer buds.<br/><br/>In Mongolia the population is subject to great fluctuations, which are reflected in the fur-trade statistics.

Its range is currently expanding westwards in Europe. Classed as Least Concern.,"Typically inhabits coniferous and mixed forests with a rich undergrowth of berry-bearing shrubs. In mountains occurs up to the tree line. Climbs trees, but lives in simple shallow burrows. Summer nests are in stumps, fallen trees, sometimes in low hollows. Usually burrows consist of two big chambers, nest and larder, and small chambers used as a lavatory. Complex voice communication is characteristic to the species. Hibernates in winter. Short and long distance migrations have been registered during years with a poor harvest of Siberan pine nuts. Feeds on various seeds, mainly on Siberian pine, but diet also includes seeds of other coniferous and deciduous trees and herbs. In spring and summer consumes herb shoots; sometimes can eat insects and molluscs. From August onward stores up food for winter, storage mass usually 3-4 kg. Reproduces after leaving hibernation, in April-May.",There are no major threats to the species.,"This species is relatively abundant alcross its range.

The species is is confined to mountainous regions. It is fairly common in south-eastern Israel: abundance in other countries is unknown. However, there are believed to be less than 1,000 mature individuals overall.</p>","Blanford's Fox is confined to mountainous regions (Lay 1967; Roberts 1977). Hassinger (1973) concluded that Blanford's Foxes are generally found below an altitude of 2,000 m in dry montane biotopes. All the records collected on the Persian Plateau are from foothills and mountains in the vicinity of lower plains and basins (Hassinger 1973; Roberts 1977). In that region, the habitat of Blanford's foxes comprises the slopes of rocky mountains with stony plains and patches of cultivation (Lay 1967; Roberts 1977). This species appears to avoid higher mountain ranges as well as lower, warmer valleys (Roberts 1977). <br/><br/>In the Middle East, Blanford's Foxes are confined to mountainous desert ranges and inhabit steep, rocky slopes, canyons and cliffs (Mendelssohn <em>et al.</em> 1987; Harrison and Bates 1989). In Israel, Blanford's Fox is distributed along the western side of the Rift Valley, and, in the central Negev, specimens were collected in creeks that drain into the Rift Valley (Geffen <em>et al</em>. 1993). Apparently, Blanford's Fox can occur on various rock formations as long as its other requirements are met. The distribution of Blanford's Fox in the Arabian Desert is not limited by access to water (Geffen <em>et al</em>. 1992a). In Israel, Blanford's Foxes inhabit the driest and hottest regions. The densest population is found in the Judaean Desert at elevations of 100-350 m below sea level. This is in contrast to Roberts' (1977) remark that the species avoids low, warm valleys in Pakistan. <br/><br/>Geffen <em>et al</em>. (1992b) found that dry creek bed was the most frequently visited habitat in all home ranges in Israel. Home ranges at Ein Gedi (in km²), comprised an average (± SD) of 63.44 ± 3.22% gravel scree, 3.63 ± 2.59% boulder scree, 28.38 ± 4.05% dry creek bed, and 4.54 ± 3.46% stream and spring. Average time (± SD) spent by foxes at Ein Gedi in gravel scree was 148.8 ± 109.8 min/night, 46.0 ± 63.8 min/night in boulder scree, 359.9 ± 141.9 min/night in dry creek bed, and 13.0 ± 27.9 min/night near a water source (Geffen <em>et al</em>. 1992b). Dry creek bed provided abundant prey for the foxes and only sparse cover for their terrestrial predators. Creek bed patches were used in proportion to their size. Both the available area of creek bed in each range and the area of creek bed patches that was used by the foxes were independent of home range size. However, variance in home range size was explained by the mean distance between the main denning area and the most frequently used patches of creek bed (Geffen <em>et al</em>. 1992b).","There are currently no obvious major range-wide threats to Blanford's Fox. In Israel, habitat loss is limited as most of the area where this species occurs is designated as protected. However, political developments may change the status of the northern Judaean Desert, and human development along the Dead Sea coasts may also pose a considerable threat to existing habitat. Similar concerns exist for the populations in the U.A.E. (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2003). They may be killed incidentally through carcass poisoning of other target species, such as hyaenas and wolves. At present, the trade in fur is negligible and confined to Afghanistan.","The only available population densities come from Israel where the species is fairly common in the south-east and where density estimates of 2.0/km² in Ein Gedi and 0.5/km² in Eilat have been recorded. Surveys in other regions, such as Arabia, indicate that Blanford's Box is locally abundant. In United Arab Emirates, for example, researchers frequently captured foxes in the north-eastern mountains of the country (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2003).",Unknown,"The Blanford's Fox was first described from south-western Asia in 1877, and specimens were collected from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Turkistan (= Turkmenistan) (Novikov 1962; Bobrinskii <em>et al.</em> 1965; Lay 1967; Hassinger 1973; Roberts 1977).

There is no evidence to suggest that it is declining at a rate approaching the thresholds for Criterion A.</p>","Their typical habitat includes sand and stone deserts. In Saudi Arabia, they have been found in open and stony habitats often with sparse vegetation cover, including a few herb and grass species (<em>Fagonia indica</em>, <em>Indigofera spinosa</em>, <em>Tribulus</em> spp., <em>Stipagrostis</em> spp. and <em>Panicum turgidum</em>) that receive little rainfall (~100 mm per year) (Lenain 2000). On the northern fringe of the Sahara, Rüppell's Fox may be found in similar areas with up to 150 mm annual rainfall. In Morocco (including Western Sahara), the general habitat presents sparse to very sparse vegetation cover, dominated by small brushes (<em>Hammada scoparia</em>, <em>Panicum turgidum</em>, <em>Fagonia</em> spp.) mostly concentrated in wadis (with <em>Acacia</em> spp., <em>Argania spinosa</em>, <em>Balanites aegyptiaca</em>, <em>Maerua crassifolia</em> and <em>Capparis deciduas</em> trees). In Niger (Dragesco-Joffé 1993) and Morocco (F. Cuzin, pers. obs.), the species avoids large sand dune areas, where the Fennec Fox is the only other reported canid species; however, in Algeria, they also occur in large ergs (De Smet 1988). In United Arab Emirates, Rüppell's Foxes occur in a variety of desert habitats including sand sheets, sand dunes, gravel plains, and inter-dune sabkhas (Murdoch <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The Rüppell's Fox also lives in coastal areas, with extremely sparse vegetation and without any trees. They are able to survive in areas with little available water, as in central Saudi Arabia (Mahazat as-Sayd protected area) on the fringes of the Arabian Empty Quarter (Lindsay and Macdonald 1986; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2007), in Algeria (De Smet 1988) and in Western Sahara, where observations do not show any relationship with the distance to the nearest available water (F. Cuzin, unpubl.).","Threats include direct and indirect persecution by hunting and indiscriminate use of poisons. In Israel, the species is on the verge of extinction due to competitive exclusion by Red Foxes that are expanding their range following human settlements in the Negev Desert (Yom-Tov and Mendelssohn 1988), and competition with Red Fox is believed to be a problem elsewhere in the range. Rarely hunted for food or for sale of furs. However, in some regions, foxes face persecution for their perceived impact on game species like Houbara Bustard (<em>Chlamydotis undulata</em>) and livestock (Murdoch <em>et al.</em> 2007).","Densities of Rüppell's Fox are usually low, but seem higher in areas where food is more freely available for example, near human settlements (Valverde 1957, K. De Smet, pers. obs.). In a large, fenced, protected area of 2,244 km² in Saudi Arabia, densities of 0.68/km² were recorded (Lenain 2000). Lower population estimates outside the fenced reserve indicate that the species may be vulnerable in the over-grazed, human-influenced landscape of central Arabia. In the reserve, the population is stable, but there is a need to document long-term population dynamics (Lenain 2000).",Unknown,"Widespread in arid regions of North Africa (north of 17ºN) from Morocco and Mauritania to Egypt and Somalia, to along the northern fringes of the Sahara Desert. Also present across the Arabian Peninsula eastwards to Pakistan (68ºE) and north-west to Israel and Jordan. A recent record for Syria is the first confirmation of their presence in this country (Serra <em>et al.</em> in press). Suspected historical expansion of distribution area is likely due to desertification, compensated by competition with the red fox due to new human settlements.

Red Foxes are adaptable and opportunistic omnivores and are capable of successfully occupying urban areas. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with man, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. The species currently is not under threat.","Red Foxes have been recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert and forest, as well as in city centres (including London, Paris, Stockholm, etc.). Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with abundant ""edge"" of scrub and woodland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains (even above the treeline, known to cross alpine passes), deserts, sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4,500 m. In the UK, they generally prefer mosaic patchworks of scrub, woodland and farmland. Red foxes flourish particularly well in urban areas. They are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing and are less common where industry, commerce or council rented housing predominates (Harris and Smith 1987). In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with man, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas.","The main threats include habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation, and exploitation, and direct and indirect persecution. However, the Red Fox's versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. There are currently bounties on subspecies <em>V. v. pusilla</em> (desert foxes) in Pakistan to protect game birds such as Houbara bustards (<em>Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii</em>), with a high hunting value.<br/><br/>The number of foxes raised for fur (although much reduced since the 1900s) exceeds that of any other species, except possibly mink (<em>Mustela vison</em>) (Obbard 1987).

Active fur trade in Britain in 1970s was negligible.","Red Fox density is highly variable. In the UK, density varies between one fox per 40 km² in Scotland and 1.17/km² in Wales, but can be as high as 30 foxes per km² in some urban areas where food is superabundant (Harris 1977; Macdonald and Newdick 1982; Harris and Rayner 1986). Social group density is one family per km² in farmland, but may vary between 0.2-5 families per km² in the suburbs and as few as a single family per 10 km² in barren uplands (Macdonald 1981; Lindsay and Macdonald 1986). Fox density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is three foxes per km² (Meia 1994). In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, they occur at densities of 0.1/km², and in southern Ontario, Canada at 1/km² (Voigt 1987). The average social group density in the Swiss mountains is 0.37 family per km² (Weber <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The pre-breeding British fox population totals an estimated 240,000 (Harris <em>et al.</em> 1995). Mean number of foxes killed per unit area by gamekeepers has increased steadily since the early 1960s in 10/10 regional subdivisions of Britain, but it is not clear to what extent this reflects an increase in fox abundance. Although an increase in fox numbers following successful rabies control by vaccination was widely reported in Europe (e.g., fox bag in Germany has risen from 250,000 in 1982-1983 to 600,000 in 2000-2001), no direct measures of population density have been taken.",Stable,"Distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central America, and the Asiatic steppes, the Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million km²).

Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the European Union, Canada, and the Russian Federation, trapping methods are regulated under an agreement on international trapping standards between these countries, which was signed in 1997. Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the UK and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained ""use"" may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport&#160;<em>–</em>&#160;the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint&#160;<em>–</em>&#160;hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs. This type of fox hunting may also be perceived as a sport by its participants. <br/><br/>An individual deciding whether or not to control foxes, and by what means, has a complex set of factors to consider, including other interest groups, practicality and economics. For some farmers, there is evidence that a decision to control foxes may be economically perverse. Macdonald <em>et al</em>. (2003) modelled the interactions between foxes, rabbits, and rabbit-induced crop damage. For some farmers at least, a decision to kill a fox may, in some circumstances, cost that farmer a significant amount of crop loss to the rabbits that the fox and its descendants would have killed.<br/><br/>In addition to fur farms, Red Foxes are widely kept in small wildlife parks and zoos, but there appears to be no systematic data on their breeding success.

They are often found in successional or forest-edge habitats, in scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks that have high densities of small mammals, especially <i>Microtus</i> and <i>Arvicola</i> species (King, 1983). Pulliainen (1999) states that coniferous and mixed woodlands are preferred, but that many other habitats are used including tundra and the summits of fells and mountains. Dense forests and deserts are avoided (King, 1983). Specifically to Mongolia, they inhabit taiga, forest-steppe and rocky parts of the semi-desert. This species is a specialist predator of small mammals, but will occasionally feed on fruit, earthworms, insects, eggs, and birds (King, 1983). Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King, 1983; Pulliainen, 1999). This species is nocturnal but are often seen in daylight hours. Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 hectares for males, most often falling between 10 to 40 hectares (King, 1983).<br><br>Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King, 1983).

Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 hectares for males, most often falling between 10 to 40 hectares (King, 1983).","On a range-wide scale, no major threats are known. Locally the species may be threatened by unrestricted trapping and habitat loss due to timber harvest or natural disturbance (Fagerstone 1987). In the Iberian Peninsula the species is dependent on two <i>Arvicola</i> species, and these are declining, so loss of prey base may be a threat (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). Habitat loss (e.g. as a result of urbanization: Pulliainen, 1999) is also a problem in parts of the range. The species is commonly hunted in Russia, where there is also a limited fur trade (McDonald pers. comm.). In western and central Europe, the stoat was frequently hunted for its white winter fur up until at least the 1930s, with c.30,000 pelts sold in Finland alone during that decade (Pulliainen, 1999). Availability of prey is the principal factor controlling population density (King, 1983; Pulliainen, 1999), but disease, parasites and other pressures can also contribute.","Total adult population size is unknown but certainly exceeds 100,000. The density and structure of populations of this species are unstable, due to short life spans and high reproductive capacity. Populations are greatly influenced by fluctuations in prey supply (especially small mammals) (King, 1983; Pulliainen, 1999). Population fluctuations of stoats and their prey tend to increase in magnitude at more northerly latitudes (Pulliainen, 1999), although fluctuations have also been recorded in Spain (Blanco, 1998; Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). In France, it was declining, but now has stabilized as a result of full protection. In Spain it has been speculated that the population may be declining as a results of declines in the southern water vole, <i>Arvicola sapidus</i>, (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002), but the population trend has not been quantified in Spain or Portugal (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002; Cabral <i>et al.</i>, 2005). It is abundant in north-western and central Mongolia, but is rare in the eastern plains (Bannikov, 1954; Dulamtseren, 1970; Sokolov and Orlov, 1980).

The highest numbers are found within Europe. Conservation measures are ongloing to prevent the population declining again and as long as these continue, there is no reason to continue to assess the species as threatened or Near Threatened. Now Least Concern.","Beavers are adapted for a semi-aquatic life, using a variety of freshwater systems, including rivers, streams, irrigation ditches, lakes, and swamps. They generally prefer freshwater habitats surrounded by woodland, but may occur in agricultural land or even suburban and urban areas (Tattersall 1999, Halley and Rosell 2002). In northern Scandinavia, beavers may be found right up to the limit of the willow zone in the mountains, where knee-high willow bushes are the only woody vegetation and it is iced over for 8 months of the year. This is not preferred habitat, but they can survive there. In many places, beavers live both on the valley floor, and on the mountain plateau above (where it is wooded), with a break in distribution where streams flow down the steep valley sides. In general beavers should be able to live in almost any freshwater habitat where there are trees or shrubs and the gradient is not precipitous. However, patterns of recolonisation demonstrate a clear preference for still or slow, laminar water flow if it is available (Nowak 1999, Halley and Rosell 2002, Halley pers. comm. 2006).","The beaver's historic decline was caused by over-hunting for fur, meat and castoreum (a secretion from the scent glands), combined with loss of wetland habitats. Beaver populations were severely reduced in most countries by mediæval times, but the species clung on in marshes and other inaccessible places until the advent of efficient steel traps and accurate firearms in the 17th century; and then through to the 19th century there was a rash of final extinctions for these reasons combined with drainage of many of the large marshland areas in which the species clung on (all of the European refugia where the species survived, except in Norway, are extensive marshlands). <br/><br/>Today, beaver populations in Europe are expanding rapidly, and there are no major threats (e.g. threats of a magnitude likely to cause decline at the regional level). Competitive exclusion of the native European beaver <em>C. fiber</em> by its American cousin <em>C. canadensis</em> may be a threat in parts of Finland and north-west Russia, but it is not a major threat regionally. In Europe North American beavers are now confined entirely to Finland and north-west Russia, where populations are increasing only slowly (due to heavy harvesting). The former population at a reservoir near Paris has been removed, and populations introduced to Poland and Austria have apparently gone extinct in competition with <em>C. fiber</em>, the opposite of what has tended to happen in Finland and north-west Russia (it has been suggested that, due to differences in the life history of the two species, Eurasian beavers may have a competitive advantage at more southerly latitudes, whilst North American beavers may be more successful further north: D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). There are no serious prospects of further introductions (Halley and Rosell 2002, D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). The two species do not interbreed (Tattersall 1999). Road kill is an important source of mortality for some populations (Tattersall 1999). Rapidly expanding beaver populations may come into conflict with humans in some areas, as they do some damage to forestry and crops. Such damages should be put into perspective: they tend to be less severe than those caused by other species such as deer and voles, but are noticed because beavers are a new and unfamiliar species in areas where they have been recently introduced (Halley and Rosell 2002).<br/><br/>In Mongolia, illegal hunting for skins, meat and castoreum still occurs in some areas such as the Tes River. Habitat loss through selective clear-cutting of willow, upon which this species relies for food and shelter is also a threat; this is known to be occurring along the Bulgan River and is leading to isolation of small populations and inbreeding. Pollution of water systems is also a threat. A hydroelectric dam in the Chinese section of the Bulgan River prevents migrations in this area (M. Stubbe pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In China, firewood gathering has depleted much of the forest on which the beavers need to subsist; additionally heavy grazing pressure has further reduced vegetation needed by beavers.","By the beginning of the 20th century, the global population had been reduced to eight populations, totalling approximately 1,200 individuals (Halley and Rosell 2002). Protection (beginning with a hunting ban implemented in Norway in 1845), natural spread and reintroductions have resulted in a rapid recovery in numbers and range, particularly in Europe. In 1998, the global population was estimated at 430,000 (Nolet and Rosell 1998), by 2002 it had reached at least 593,000 (Halley and Rosell 2002), and in 2006 the minimum estimate was 639,000 (D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). This is almost certainly a considerable underestimate, as both population and range are in rapid expansion (Halley and Rosell 2002, 2003; D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). Considerable further expansion in range and population, especially in western Europe and the lower Danube basin, can be expected. If current trends continue, the Eurasian beaver will be a fairly common mammal in much of Europe within the next few decades. <br/><br/>However, populations in Asia are still considered small. In Mongolia, reintroductions have been successful and the population has reached 150, and in China the population is about 700 (Halley and Rosell 2002, EMA Workshop 2006, Smith and Xie in press).<br/><br/>In Mongolia in 1964, the population size was estimated to consist of 100-150 individuals (Stubbe and Chotolchu, 1968), rising to 200 individuals by 1973 (Zevegmid and Dawaa, 1973). In 1991, surveys estimated there to be approximately 300 individuals along Bulgan and Hovd rivers (Stubbe <em>et al.</em>, 1991). The most recent population assessment was conducted in 2004, which recorded 40 lodges along Hovd River and estimated the population to consist of 130-150 individuals (Shar, 2005). Ten beaver settlements were recorded in the Tuvan section of Tes River in 2005 (A. Saveljev pers. comm.), and the Mongolian section of this river is believed to contain a similar beaver population (M. Stubbe pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The Chinese subspecies of the Eurasian Beaver (C. f. birulai) is one of the rarest and least known aquatic mammals in China.  In the 1970s it was believed that only 100 animals remained in fewer than 20 family groups.  Currently, only one substantial population is known, at the Buergan River Beaver Reserve along the Xinjiang-Mongolian border - a narrow strip 50 km long and only 500 m wide.  Here the population is estimated to be only 500 animals, and only 700 may live in all of China.",Increasing,"The Eurasian beaver <em>Castor fiber</em> was once widespread in Europe and Asia. However, by the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, over-hunting had drastically reduced both the numbers and range of the species. In Europe, only a few isolated sites remained: parts of the Rhone (France) and Elbe (Germany), southern Norway, the Neman River and Dnepr Basin (Belarus) and Voronezh (Russia). A series of management measures and reintroductions have enabled the beaver to return to much of its former range, and there are now a number of rapidly expanding populations extending from Spain and France across central and eastern Europe to European Russia, and in Scandinavia and parts of western Finland. <br/><br/>Free-living populations of beavers are now established or establishing in most regions of their former European range, the main exceptions to date being Portugal, Italy, the south Balkans and Great Britain (Halley and Rosell 2002, Ceña <em>et al.</em> 2004). Detailed information on the status and distribution of the Eurasian beaver in each range state can be found in Halley and Rosell (2002), and information on the population that was translocated to Spain in 2003 can be found in Ceña <em>et al.</em> (2004). It is generally a lowland species, but occurs up to 850 m in Europe (Halley pers. comm. 2006). <br/><br/>In Mongolia, a small population exists along the Bulgan River in northern Dzungarian Govi Desert, in the south-western corner of Mongolia. Mongolian-German Biological Expeditions carried out conservation introductions along Hovd River in Mongol Altai Mountain Range in 1974, 1975, and 1978, and along Tes River in northern Hangai Mountain Range in 1985, 1988 and 2002. In all cases Mongolian beavers from the Bulgan River were used in order to protect the gene pool in the central Asiatic hydro-geographic basin (Stubbe and Dawaa, 1982; Stubbe <em>et al.</em>, 2005a). A separate attempt to reintroduce beavers from Voronezh Reserve (Russian Federation) was unsuccessful (M. Stubbe pers. comm.).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"A number of conservation measures have contributed to the species' recovery in Europe, including reintroductions and translocations, hunting restrictions, and habitat protection. It is listed under the Bern Convention (Appendix III) and the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex V for the Swedish and Finnish populations, Annex II and IV for all others). In Finland, <em>C. canadensis</em> populations are controlled to prevent them spreading into the west where <em>C. fiber</em> occurs. Halley and Rosell (2002) recommend regulated hunting as the optimal management regime in managed landscapes with healthy beaver populations. Management of beaver populations should be at the watershed scale, except where large human-made dams form significant barriers to spread. Early provision of interpretation and public viewing opportunities is also recommended, as this provides a benefit to the local economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to beavers (Halley and Rosell 2002). This has been a successful feature of several recent reintroductions. Reintroduction to Italy has been recommended in a European Union/Bern Convention Nature and Environment Series document (Nolet 1996). Considerable efforts have been made to develop a beaver reintroduction programme in Scotland, and a full public consultation showed strong support for such a scheme among the general public, including in rural areas where beavers were likely to be released (Halley and Rosell 2002).<br/><br/>In Mongolia, <em>C. f. birulai</em> is protected as Very Rare under part 7.1 of the Law of the Mongolian Animal Kingdom (2000), and is included as Rare in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books (Shagdarsuren <em>et al.</em>, 1987; MNE, 1997).

It is generally a lowland species, but occurs up to 850 m in Europe (D.J. Halley pers. comm. 2006).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"A number of conservation measures have contributed to the species' recovery in Europe, including reintroductions and translocations, hunting restrictions, and habitat protection. It is listed under the Bern Convention (Appendix III) and the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex V for the Swedish and Finnish populations, Annex II &amp; IV for all others). In Finland, <em>C. canadensis</em> populations are controlled to prevent them spreading into the west where <em>C. fiber</em> occurs. Halley and Rosell (2002) recommend regulated hunting as the optimal management regime in managed landscapes with healthy beaver populations. Management of beaver populations should be at the watershed scale, except where large human-made dams form significant barriers to spread. Early provision of interpretation and public viewing opportunities is also recommended, as this provides a benefit to the local economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to beavers (Halley and Rosell 2002). This has been a successful feature of several recent reintroductions. Reintroduction to Italy has been recommended in a European Union/Bern Convention Nature and Environment Series document (Nolet 1996). Considerable efforts have been made to develop a beaver reintroduction programme in Scotland, and a full public consultation showed strong support for such a scheme among the general public, including in rural areas where beavers were likely to be released (Halley and Rosell 2002).",Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

Significant declines have been reported in many parts of the rabbit's European range, and it is inferred that declines approach 30% over the last 10 years overall. Consequently the species is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A2b). In many countries outside Europe, the rabbit is an alien invasive species that is itself a threat to many other species; the listing of Near Threatened in Europe should not in any way deter efforts to eradicate the rabbit in areas where it is a conservation problem.","The rabbit occupies a variety of habitats, including grassland, meadows, pastures, arable field-margins, sand-dunes, grassy cliffs, heathland and open woodland. In summer, it feeds on the vegetative parts of a variety of grasses and herbaceous plants, and in winter it eats grasses, bulbs and bark (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). It can be an agricultural pest in areas where it is abundant, and it has caused severe damage to native ecosystems in some areas where it has been introduced (for example Australia) (Ward 2005). Rabbits are an essential keystone element of the Mediterranean ecosystem in Spain and Portugal, being preyed on by at least 39 predator species including the Critically Endangered Iberian lynx <em>Lynx pardinus</em> and the vulnerable and range-restricted Iberian imperial eagle <em>Aquila adalberti</em> (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006). Rabbit declines are considered to have had a negative impact on both of these threatened species (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006).","Myxomatosis caused severe population declines in the 1950s, but numbers subsequently rallied as the myxoma virus become less virulent and the rabbit more immune (Macdonald and Barrett 1993, Macdonald and Tattersall 2001). Myxomatosis was deliberately introduced to Europe in 1952 in an effort to control rabbit numbers; it originates from South America (Ward 2005). Declines in recent years have been attributed to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; also known as DHV), myxomatosis, and over-hunting (Ward 2005, Spitzenberger 2005). RHD is believed to have originated in Europe, where it was first detected in 1987 (Ward 2005). Habitat loss (due to agriculture, forestry, development, forest fires and land abandonment) is considered to be a contributory factor to rabbit decline in Iberia (Ward 2005). It is a popular game species, and over-hunting may be a problem in some parts of its range. Pest control measures may cause local population declines. There have been attempts in Australia to develop a genetically modified immunocontraceptive virus for rabbits, and accidental or deliberate illegal spread of such a virus could be a threat to rabbits in the future (Henzell and Cooke 2003, Trout 2003, Ward 2005).","It is a common species throughout much of its European range. Population densities of 0.5 to 10 individuals per hectare are typical, with densities of up to 100 individuals per hectare having been recorded (Homolka and Zima 1999). However, in at least some parts of Europe the species has undergone significant decline in recent years. In Portugal, a population reduction of 24% was recorded between 1995 and 2002 (Alves and Ferreira 2002), and in Spain and Portugal as a whole it is estimated that there are now as few as 5% of the number of rabbits that existed 50 years ago (Ward 2005). Large declines since 1990 have also been noted in Austria (Spitzenberger 2005) and Germany (Eylert 2004), and in the UK the species declined significantly between 1995 and 2002 (different survey methods give a 48% decline from 1995-2002 and a 23% decline from 1997-2002: Battersby 2005). Subspecies <em>O. c. huxleyi</em>, which occurs on certain Atlantic and Mediterranean islands, has a restricted range and may be threatened (Homolka and Zima 1999).",Decreasing,"<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> is a widespread and abundant species, which has been introduced to all continents except Antartica. It was originally restricted to Spain, Portugal, western France, and northern Africa, but it has spread over the last two millenia to almost all parts of the European region, including the British Isles, many Mediterranean islands, the Azores, and Madeira. This range expansion occurred partly because of deliberate introductions, as the rabbit was widely exploited as a food source, and partly through natural spread. It remains absent from most of Fennoscandia, and occurs only sporadically on the Balkan peninsula. Outside Europe, it was introduced to Australia, in 1788 and again in 1859, where it is now widespread (Thompson and King 1994). It was introduced to South America unsuccessfully several times since the mid-nineteenth century, and successfully in about 1936; it now maintains a limited range in Argentina and Chile (Thompson and King 1994). Found in many islands in the Pacific, off the African coast, New Zealand, and the Caribbean (Thompson and King 1994).",,Terrestrial,"The issue of eradication of <em>O. cuniculus</em> from its introduced range (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and many islands) may have overshadowed the significance of rabbit decline in its native range. However, the importance of <em>O. cuniculus</em> within its natural range necessitates that it be considered for listing as threatened in spite of its global abundance. It is a keystone component of the Iberian ecosystem, as prey for specialist predators (Virgos <em>et al.</em> 2005) and as a landscape modeller (Delibes <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ward 2005). It is an important game species in Spain and Portugal (Ward 2005). <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> occurs in some protected areas within its natural range, including Donana National Park in Spain (Ward 2005) and Serra da Malcata Nature reserve in Portugal (700km<sup>2</sup>) where the Iberian lynx is protected.<br/><br/>Ward (2005) summarises key issues regarding the conservation of the European rabbit within its native range: <br/>""- Establish rabbit monitoring programs to accurately describe decline directly.<br/>- Create and implement a management plan for rabbit recovery that prioritizes critical ranges and populations. Some plans have begun for local regions, including Donana National park.  <br/>- Programs to limit the incidence and impact of new and existing diseases may be difficult in the wild, though some success has been observed in captive populations. Current vaccines do not confer total immunity to RHD or myxomatosis, have side effects such as increasing vulnerability to predators, and have short-lived effectiveness. A genetically modified live myxomatosis virus vaccine, LapinVac, is controversial because of the possibility of unpredictable evolution of the virus, and its potential spread to rabbit populations outside the natural <em>O. cuniculus</em> range where eradication, not conservation, is the objective. Increasing habitat quality may indirectly help rabbit disease resistance. Controlling disease vectors for myxomatosis has not been found to be effective. Preventing the spread of modified immunocontraceptive viruses engineered in Australia to control rabbit fertility may become an issue.<br/>- Reducing hunting impact is not guaranteed to reduce decline because disease effects often outweigh hunting as a threat, and because implementation of restrictions would likely not be realistic given the prevalence of hunting in Iberia. Revisions to existing hunting seasons have been proposed and some tested, but even moving the season to summer when rabbits are most abundant has caused concern in trials because the overall catch increases and the season coincides with a peak in death from disease. A growing recognition among hunters of the issue of rabbit decline has led to some self-restraint, and though often well intentioned, uninformed management strategies are leading to inappropriate actions. Rather than focusing on hunting restraint, many hunters exert efforts to reduce rabbit predators, which are not directly responsible for decline. As a very large demographic, hunters could represent a powerful force in maintaining sustainable hunting populations, if the awareness of the issue of decline increased within this group.<br/>- Rabbit populations affected by agriculture represent a sensitive issue, as rabbits are typically seen as a pest and an economic liability for farmers. Despite pressures from environmental groups, many farmers continue to take measures to eradicate rabbits from their land, even in areas where rabbit populations have declined dramatically. Awareness among farmers of rabbit conservation issues is low. Government policy allows farmers to control rabbits with permits, and though crop loss due to rabbit damage is economically subsidized, no requirement of those compensated is made for conservation.<br/>- Halting and reversing habitat loss and fragmentation was aided in the 1990s by the establishment of many national parks in Spain, but much optimal rabbit habitat is on private land. A shift from high-intensity farming and monoculture forestry back to mixed agro-forestry and small scale farming would help sustain rabbit populations. Natura 2000 promotion of sustainable development and EU subsidies supporting environmentally friendly agriculture are promising but underfunded and too new to demonstrate a significant impact. Eucalyptus plantation removal has demonstrated a positive effect on rabbit populations, but may compromise other environmental issues such as erosion and conditioned bird habitat, as well as economic impact.<br/>- Reintroductions have been a key focus of conservation efforts, with up to 500,000 released annually in Spain and France. The efforts so far have not increased rabbit populations, due to increased mortality from predation and inadvertent spread of disease, which may actually have a net negative impact. The flaws in reintroduction practices do not completely negate the importance of the efforts, which have been shown to help sustain predators and hunting populations. The success of introductions may be increased by fencing from predators and competitors and preventing dispersal.<br/>- Though rabbit predators have not directly caused rabbit decline, factors that have caused initial decline (e.g., disease, habitat loss) are exacerbated by some opportunistic predators (while not caused by specialist predators like the Iberian lynx and Imperial eagle). Game keeping efforts to increase rabbit populations often focus on predator reduction, sometimes counterproductively, causing decline of top predators that are already threatened. Efforts could be more productively focused on habitat protection, reduction of rabbit mortality by humans (hunting, poisoning), and reducing disease impacts.""",Afrotropical|Australasian|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

Throughout their neotropical range <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. tajacu </span>consume fruits from over 128 plant species, and destroy seeds form 79 species (Beck 2006). In tropical forests, diets are dominated by palm fruits (over 25 species, Beck 2005), supplemented with small vertebrates and invertebrates (Bodmer 1989, Beck 2005), whereas in deserts environments their diet is dominated by the cladophylls of prickly pear cactus (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Opuntia</span> spp.) (Corn and Warren 1985, Beck 2005). In a heterogeneous environment, the distribution and abundance of resources would be expected to vary among the small, spatially-stable home ranges of Collared Peccary herds. Because each herd uses a unique subset of the available habitat types (McCoy <em>et al</em> 1990, Judas and Henry, 1999, Fragoso,1999; Keuroghlian <em>et al</em> 2004, Neri 2004). The level of frugivory will vary according to local vegetation types or frugivore guild composition (Keuroghlian and Eaton 2008). Frugivory in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil for Collared Peccaries was 78% for both the dry and wet seasons. In the Peruvian Amazon 59 - 66% was composed of fruits (Kiltie 1981, Bodmer 1989); and in the Brazilian Pantanal, frugivory dramatically differed between dry and wet seasons, 17% to 49% respectively (Desbiez 2007). <br/>Habitat and riparian zone use were herd specific for Collared Peccaries in the Atlantic Forest fragment of Brazil, and related to habitat quality and composition where stable home ranges had been established (Neri 2007, Keuroghlian and Eaton in press). Herds are kept together by vocalizations and a strong musk released from the dorsal gland. They deposit scent on tree trunks, rocks and other individuals (Byers 1980). The Collared Peccary has a diurnal/crepuscular activity pattern, typically feeding in early hours of the night but varying seasonally. They commonly rest in small groups of three to four individuals and often seek shelter in burrows, caves and under logs. Collared Peccaries frequently wallow in mud or dust and rarely spend time auto-grooming (Sowls 1984). Keuroghlian <em>et al</em> 2004 observed that subgrouping of herds occurred on a different spatial and temporal scale than the subherding of White-lipped Peccaries. Usually, a herd would be united early in the morning and again in late afternoon, but would split into groups of 1 to 3 individuals during the day. These subgroups appeared to forage separately and were from 30 to 250 m apart. Sightings of lone Collared Peccaries or groups of 2 to 3 individuals have frequently been reported from sites in both the Neotropics and the southwestern United States (Kiltie and Terborgh, 1983; Robinson and Eisenberg, 1985; Sowls, 1997; Castellanos, 1983; Oldenburg <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bissonette, 1976; Green <em>et al</em>. 1984). Collared Peccaries appeared to travel more in the early morning and late afternoon, when the full herd was together. During midday, subherds would usually remain in a relatively restricted area foraging. They also spent a good part of late morning and early afternoon resting in cavities excavated at the bases of large trees, next to fallen trunks, or in other cool locations (Taber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1994, Keuroghlian <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/>Births have been recorded year-round, though in the southern USA there is a birth peak during the summer rainy season. In the Amazon, the Collared Peccary female is considered to be aseasonally polyoestrous (Mayor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006), with an oestrous cycle length of 27.8 ± 1.5 days (Mauget <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997), a mean gestation period of 138 days (Mayor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005), a pregnancy rate of 42.5% (Mayor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010) and a litter size of 1.7 – 1.9 foetuses or newborns (Gottdenker and Bodmer 1998, Mayor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006). Reproductive production of the species in the wild was estimated at 1.12 births/year and 1.98 piglets per pregnant female (Mayor<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2010). Collared Peccary females presented a mean ovulation rate of 2.25 ± 0.58 CLs, a litter size of 1.77 ± 0.48 embryos or foetuses and a reproductive wastage of 0.45 ± 0.65 (21.3%) oocytes or embryos per pregnant female female (Mayor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Among 163 piglets, 78 were females and 85 were males. The young are highly precocial at birth, following their mothers within an hour of parturition and stopping to suckle at frequent intervals. In one case infants were observed to spend up to 24% of their time suckling (Sowls 1966). Weaning occurs at approximately 6 weeks (Sowls 1984).","The two major threats to the survival of Collared Peccary are over-hunting for their meat and hides and excessive destruction of its natural habitats. These factors have already resulted in the extensive fragmentation of peccary populations and its extirpation over large parts of its former range (Bodmer and Sowls 1993). The Collared Peccary (<em>Pecari tajacu</em>) and White-lipped Peccary (<em>Tayassu pecari</em>) are important resources for subsistence hunters of the Peruvian Amazon (Bodmer <em>et al</em>. 2004a). In Peru, subsistence hunting of peccaries is legally defined as the use of peccary meat for household consumption or the sale of peccary meat in settlements of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. Rural inhabitants hunt peccaries mainly for their meat, which have an economic value of approximately $23 for a Collared Peccary and $30 for a white-lipped peccary either as subsistence food or through local sale (Bodmer <em>et al</em>. 2004b). Peccary pelts are sold as a by-product and have an economic value to hunters of approximately $5 for a Collared Peccary pelt and $3 for a White-lipped Peccary pelt (Bodmer and Pezo 2001, Fang 2003). Approximately 51,419 Collared Peccary pelts and 20,522 White-lipped Peccary pelts are legally exported with CITES permits every year from Peru under a quota system imposed by the Peruvian government (INRENA 2004). The pelts are tanned in Peru and primarily sold to the European leather industry for the manufacture of high quality gloves and shoes. However, it is unclear if this trade increases the hunting pressure to meet the quotas. Furthermore, how many individuals have to be killed to obtain pelts that meet the quality standards of international trade (assuming that a given number of pelt are rejected because of scars, parasite marks i.e. bot flies, and bullet holes). In addition, considering that peccary glove can sell for as much as $285, a $5 reward for a Collared Peccary pelt does not qualify as a fare trade. On the other hand, increasing the dollar value would certainly further increase the hunting pressure.","<p>Densities of Collared Peccary differ among habitats. In the south-eastern USA, older reports of densities ranged from 10.9 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in the Tucson mountains (Schweinsburg 1969), 7.3 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> at the King Ranch, Texas and 3.5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> at the Welder Wildlife Refuge, Texas, to only 1.1 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in a Texas desert. In Venezuela, Collared Peccary density in the llanos was found to be 8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, whereas, in gallery forests was 2 individuals/km<sup>2 </sup>(Eisenberg 1980). In the Pantanal of Brazil densities range from 6.6 (forested) to 5.5 (cerrado) &#160;individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Desbiez 2007). Densities in tropical forest range from 9 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Glanz 1982), to 5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Manu National Park, Peru (Terborgh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1986). In the Peruvian Amazon, densities range from 3,7 individuals/km<sup>2 </sup>in non-flooded terra firme forest to 1.0 in flooded forest (Fang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In a forest fragment of Atlantic Forest of Brazil, the density found was 5.9 and 6.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Cullen 1997, Keuroghlian <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). In a recent study conducted in the Argentine Chaco, Altrichter and Boaglio (2004) found the Collared Peccary to be more common, widely distributed and present under a wider range of conditions than the other two species of peccaries. Previous studies have shown that Collared Peccaries are less vulnerable than White-lipped Peccaries to habitat fragmentation and hunting pressure, and can maintain healthy populations even in highly degraded areas (Peres 1996, Cullen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). The Collared Peccary's smaller herd size and range requirements facilitate its survival in small, disturbed forest remnants (i.e. Atlantic Forest of Brazil), and they have frequently been observed using matrix habitat adjacent to larger forest fragments, e.g. satellite forests and secondary growth (Keuroghlian <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004).</p>",Stable,"The Collared Peccary is widely distributed. It occurs in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the USA, a large part of Mexico and Central America, the entire Amazon basin, the Pacific coastal forest of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, the llanos and lowland forest of Venezuela, the Guianas and Suriname, all of Brazil where it is increasingly fragmented in the south and east, and the Gran Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia and northern Argentina where it also occurs in the upper Parana and Paraguay river basins. In Argentina, the species is extinct in the eastern and southern portions of its original distribution. The Argentine population/s of Collared Peccaries in Misiones is isolated from the rest of the country. Some of the larger islands near the mainland in the Caribbean, such as Trinidad and Tobago, also have populations of <em>P. tajacu</em>. However, islands further from the mainland do not currently have peccaries. Their range has recently expanded northward in the southwestern United States (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2004) including into Oklahoma adjacent to Texas (Stangl and Dalquest 1990).","It is hunted heavily for food, and its hides are traded internationally.",Terrestrial,"Collared Peccaries occur in a large number of national parks and other reserves throughout their extensive range in the Americas. In many of these areas populations are relatively secure, although poaching and inefficient protection are common and may nullify the nominal protection afforded by the designation of protected sites (Bodmer and Sowls 1993). Conservation measures specific to Collared Peccaries include national wildlife protection legislatures, which vary from country to country, and the inclusion in 1986 of this and other peccary species on the Appendices of CITES. The Collared Peccary was originally placed on Appendix III of CITES and in 1986 it was elevated to Appendix II (except the populations of Mexico and the United States of America, which are not included in the Appendices). Specific management regulations appertaining to hunting and movement of peccary products exist for all countries within the geographical range of <em>P. tajacu</em>. In the USA, for example, the species is managed as a game animal outside national parks and reserves, and may be hunted with permits under a quota system operated by state authorities. In Brazil there is a total ban on all hunting of peccaries by non-indigenous people, though this is largely unenforced in many states. Subsistence hunting is permitted in Colombia and Venezuela, but these countries prohibit the movement of peccary products, whilst in other countries, such as Peru, subsistence hunters are allowed to trade peccary products under management laws. However, in these and many Central and South American countries, rural people are often unaware of wildlife management regulations or these are flouted, sometimes quite openly, owing to the common lack of resources and trained personnel for the enforcement of protective legislation.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Population size, area of occupancy, and habitat quality are all declining, and the species faces a number of serious threats including bycatch, habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, and competition from introduced species. Surveys in Russia indicate that the population declined from 39,000 in 1985 to 27,000 in 2000/2001, and it is suspected that rates of decline have increased since then. The desman recently went extinct in Belarus. Overall, it is suspected that declines exceed 30% over a ten-year period in the past or future, so the species is classed as Vulnerable.","A riparian species, it is found in holes primarily along oxbow lakes, less frequently by rivers and ponds. It does not inhabit all water bodies within its range; it has quite strict habitat requirements and prefers water bodies with rich water-marsh vegetation, bushes and primary forests along the banks. Prefers lakes with 1-2 m depth with rich invertebrate fauna. Also found in small rivers with slow flow. In favourable years it is able to reproduce during the whole year, but usually has two reproduction peaks at the end of spring and autumn. Males participate in care of young. Omnivorous, recorded feeding on at least 72 species of water invertebrates and 30 plant species, as well as fish and amphibians.","The main threat to the Russian desman at present is the widespread use of fixed fishing nets. These nets, which are used by poachers, have become increasingly cheap and widely available in recent years: a recent study recorded 50 'outlets' freely selling these nets on the Moscow-Vladimir section of the Nizhny Novgorod highway alone (http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html). The very low price and high durability of modern nets means that poachers often leave them in the water for days or even months, checking them only occasionally and often abandoning them. A desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. <br/><br/>The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the desman depends upon.  <br/><br/>A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced nutria (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>) and muskrats (<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>) may also be a threat.","At the beginning of the 1970s in the Soviet Union there were about 70,000 individuals, of which the majority occurred in Russia, with about 1,500 individuals in Kazahstan and single records in Ukraine and Belarus. More recent surveys in the Russian Federation indicate that the population there declined from 39,000 in 1985 to 27,000 in 2000/2001, and it is suspected that rates of decline have increased since then owing to growing threats from fisheries bycatch.

Although there are few accurate data on historical population size, from what is known about trends in habitat loss/degradation and other threats including poaching, an overall population decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (estimated to be 60–75 years, based on a generation time estimated to be 20–25 years) seems realistic.","Asian elephants are generalists and they occur in grassland, tropical evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forested and dry thorn forest, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Over this range of habitat types elephants are seen from sea level to over 3,000 m asl. In the Eastern Himalaya in northeast India, they regularly move up above 3,000 m asl in summer at a few sites (Choudhury, 1999). The Asian elephant is one of the last few mega-herbivores (i.e. plant-eating mammals that reach an adult body weight in excess of 1,000 kg) still extant on earth (Owen-Smith, 1988). Given their physiology and energy requirements, elephants need to consume large quantities of food per day. They are generalists and browse and graze on a variety of plants. The proportions of the different plant types in their diet vary depending upon the habitat and season. During dry season in southern India, Sukumar (1992) observed that 70% of the elephant's diet was browse, while in wet season, grasses make up about 55%. However, in an adjoining area, Baskaran (2002) observed that browse formed only 15% of the diet in dry deciduous forest and 47% of the diet in the thorn forest in the dry season, while the annual diet was dominated by grass (84%). In Sri Lanka, elephants may feed on more than 60 species of plants belonging to 30 families (McKay, 1973). In southern India, Baskaran (2002) recorded that elephants fed on 82 species of plants (59 woody plant species and 23 grass species). Elephants may spend up to 14–19 hrs a day feeding, during which they may consume up to 150 kg of wet weight (Vancuylenberg, 1977). They defecate about 16–18 times a day, producing about 100 kg of dung. Dung also helps disperse germinating seeds. <br/><br/>Elephants range over large areas and home ranges in excess of 600 km² have been recorded for females in south India (Baskaran <em>et al</em>., 1995). In north India, female home ranges of 184–326 km² and male home ranges of 188–407 km² have been recorded (Williams, 2002). Smaller home range sizes, 30–160 km² for females and 53–345 km² for males, have been recorded in Sri Lanka (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2005). Given their requirements for large areas, elephants are regarded as an “umbrella species” because their conservation will also protect a large number of other species occupying the same area. They are also a premier “flagship species” and are sometimes regarded as a “keystone species” because of their important ecological role and impact on the environment.<br/><br/>The life span of Asian elephants is 60 to 70 years, and males reach sexual maturity at between 10–15 years of age; females usually first give birth in years 15 or 16 (Shoshani and Eisenberg, 1982).","The pre-eminent threats to the Asian elephant today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation (Leimgruber <em>et al</em>., 2003; Sukumar, 2003; Hedges, 2006), which are driven by an expanding human population, and lead in turn to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when elephants eat or trample crops. Hundreds of people and elephants are killed annually as a result of such conflicts. The long-term future of elephants outside protected areas, as well as in some protected areas, is therefore inextricably linked to mitigating such human–elephant conflicts, and this is one of the largest conservation challenges in Asia today (Sukumar, 1992, 2003; Hedges 2006).<br/><br/>Asian elephants live in the region of the world with the densest human population, growing at a rate of between 1–3% per year. Because elephants require much larger areas of natural habitat than most other terrestrial mammals in Asia, they are one of the first species to suffer the consequences of habitat fragmentation and destruction and because of its great size and large food requirements, the elephant cannot co-exist with people in areas where agriculture is the dominant form of land-use. In extreme cases, elephants have been confined as so called ‘pocketed herds’ in small patches of forest in landscapes dominated by man. Such ‘pocketed herds’ represent an extreme stage in the human–elephant conflict (Olivier, 1978). In other cases elephants have been caught and taken to so-called Elephant Training Centres where they languish, lost to the wild population (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005, 2006). <br/><br/>Poaching is a major threat to elephants in Asia too, although reliable estimates of the number of elephants killed and the quantities of ivory and other body parts collected and traded are scarce (Sukumar <em>et al</em>., 1998; Milliken, 2005). It has been argued that poaching is a relatively minor threat to Asian elephant because some males and all females lack tusks (Dawson and Blackburn, 1991). However, the reality is that elephants are poached for a variety of other products (including meat and leather) in addition to ivory, and poaching is now acknowledged as a threat to the long-term survival of some Asian elephant populations (e.g. Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Menon, 2002). Moreover, poaching of elephants for ivory is a serious problem in some parts of Asia (Sukumar, 1992; Menon <em>et al</em>., 1997). In Periyar Tiger Reserve in southern India, for example, ivory poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios: over the 20-year period from 1969 to 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122 (Chandran, 1990). Selective removal of tusked males has several implications for the affected populations: sex ratios obviously become highly female biased, genetic variation is reduced, and fecundity and recruitment may decline (Sukumar <em>et al</em>., 1998; Sukumar, 2003). Poaching of elephants is also a major problem in other parts of Asia. Large-scale hunting of elephants for ivory, bushmeat, hides, and other products has reduced their populations significantly over a wide area from Myanmar to Indonesia (Menon <em>et al</em>., 1997; Duckworth and Hedges, 1998; Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Martin and Stiles, 2002; Menon, 2002; World Wide Fund for Nature, 2002a; Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005).","A recent estimate for the global population size of the Asian elephant was 41,410–52,345 animals Sukumar (2003) The estimated population size for each country was: Bangladesh 150–250; Bhutan 250–500; Cambodia 250–600; China 200–250; India 26,390–30,770; Indonesia 2,400–3,400; Lao PDR 500–1,000; Malaysia 2,100–3,100; Myanmar 4,000–5,000; Nepal 100–125; Sri Lanka 2,500–4,000; Thailand 2,500–3,200; and Viet Nam 70–150 (Sukumar, 2003) . However, Blake and Hedges (2004) and Hedges (2006) argue that the oft-repeated global population ‘estimate’ of about 40,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants is no more than a crude guess, which has been accepted unchanged for a quarter of a century. They argue that with very few exceptions all we really know about the status of Asian elephants is the location of some (probably most) populations, with in some cases a crude idea of relative abundance; and for some large parts of the species range we do not even know where the populations are, or indeed if they are still extant. These difference of opinion are due in part to the difficulty in counting elephants in dense vegetation in difficult terrain, different survey techniques being used in different places, and a too-widely held belief that population monitoring is unimportant. Nevertheless, whatever the error margins, it appears almost certain that over 50% of the remaining wild Asian elephants occur in India. <br/><br/>The overall population trend of the Asian elephant has been downwards, probably for centuries. This remains the case in most parts of its range, but especially in most of the countries of South-east Asia. Within India, there is evidence that the large population in the Western Ghats in south of the country has been increasing in recent years due to improved conservation effectiveness.",Decreasing,"Asian elephants formerly ranged from West Asia along the Iranian coast into the Indian subcontinent, eastwards into South-east Asia including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and into China at least as far as the Yangtze-Kiang. This former range covered over 9 million km² (Sukumar 2003). Asian elephants are now extinct in West Asia, Java, and most of China The western populations (<em>Elephas maximus asurus</em>) were probably extinct by 100 BC, and the main Chinese populations (sometimes referred to as <em>E. m. rubridens</em>) disappeared sometime after the 14th century BC. Even within its surviving range in South and South-east Asia, the species has been in retreat for hundreds if not thousands of years, and generally survives only in highly fragmented populations (Olivier 1978; Sukumar 2003; Blake and Hedges 2004).<br/><br/>Asian elephants still occur in isolated populations in 13 states, with a very approximate total range area of 486,800 km² (Sukumar 2003; but see Blake and Hedges 2004). The species occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in South Asia and Cambodia, China, Indonesia (Kalimantan and Sumatra) Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam in South-east Asia. Feral populations occur on some of the Andaman Islands (India).<br/><br/>The elephants of Borneo were believed to be feral descendants of elephants introduced in the 14th–19th centuries (Shoshani and Eisenberg, 1982; Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008); however, recent genetic evidence suggests they are indigenous to the island (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2003; but see Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008). <br/><br/>The species was once found throughout Sri Lanka, but today elephants are restricted mostly to the lowlands in the dry zone where they are still fairly widespread in north, south, east, north-western, north-central and south-eastern Sri Lanka; but with the exceptions of small remnant populations in the Peak Wilderness Area and Sinharaja Area, elephants are absent from the wet zone of the country. The species continues to lose range to development activities throughout the island. <br/><br/>Once widespread in India, the species is now restricted to four general areas: northeastern India, central India, northwestern India, and southern India. In northeastern India, the elephant range extends from the eastern border of Nepal in northern West Bengal through western Assam along the Himalaya foothills as far as the Mishmi Hills. From here it extends into eastern Arunachal Pradesh, the plains of upper Assam, and the foothills of Nagaland. Further west, it extends to the Garo Hills of Meghalaya through the Khasi Hills, to parts of the lower Brahmaputra plains and Karbi Plateau. Elsewhere in the south in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and the Barak valley districts of Assam, isolated herds occur (Choudhury, 1999). In central India, highly fragmented elephant populations are found in the States of Orissa, Jharkhand, and the southern part of West Bengal, with some animals wandering into Chattisgarh. In north-western India, the species occurs in six fragmented populations at the foot of the Himalayas in Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh, ranging from Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Bahraich Forest Division in the east, to the Yamuna River in the west. In southern India, elephants occur in the hilly terrain of the Western Ghats and in parts of the Eastern Ghats in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and, relatively recently, Andhra Pradesh. There are eight main populations in southern India, each fragmented from the others: northern Karnataka; the crestline of Karnataka–Western Ghats; Bhadra–Malnad; Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats; Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore; Anamalais–Parambikulam; Periyar–Srivilliputhur; and Agasthyamalais.<br/><br/>In Nepal, elephants were once widespread in the lowland Terai, but are now restricted to a few protected areas along the border with India: Royal Chitwan National Park, Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Royal Bardia National Park, and Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, and their environs. There is some movement of animals between these protected areas and between Bardia National Park and the adjacent parts of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, all the existing elephant populations are found along the border with India. They are reported from Royal Manas National Park, Namgyal Wangchuk Wildlife Sanctuary, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Reserve Forests such as Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary, Dungsum, and Mochu. In the past, elephants made seasonal migrations from Bhutan to the grasslands of India during the wetter summer months of May to October, returning to their winter range in Bhutan from November. Now these movements are restricted as a result of loss of habitat on the Indian side and fragmentation of habitat on the Bhutan side. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, the species was once widespread, but today it is largely restricted to areas that are relatively less accessible to humans, mainly Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the southeast. In addition, some animals periodically visit the New Samanbag area of Maulvi Bazar District under the Sylhet Forest Division in the north-east of the country, coming from the neighbouring Indian states of Tripura, Meghalaya, and Assam.<br/><br/>The Asian elephant has a wide, but highly fragmented, distribution in Myanmar. The five main areas of elephant abundance are: the Northern Hill Ranges, the Western Hill Ranges, Pegu Yoma (central Myanmar), Tenasserim Yoma (in the south, bordering Thailand), and Shan State or eastern Yoma.<br/><br/>In Thailand, the species occurs mainly in the mountains along the border with Myanmar, with smaller fragmented populations occurring in the peninsula in the south (in several forest complexes, south to the border with Malaysia); in the northeast (in the Dong Phaya Yen-Khao Yai forest complex, including Khao Yai National Park, and the Phu Khieo-Nam Nao forest complex); and in the east (in a forest complex composing the Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Khitchakut National Park, and Khao Cha Mao National Park).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, elephants are primarily found in the mountains of the south-west and in Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri Provinces. Recent surveys in Keo Sema District (Mondulkiri Province) suggest that important numbers may remain in that area (WCS unpubl. data). Elsewhere, Asian elephants persist in Cambodia in only small, scattered populations (Duckworth and Hedges, 1998).<br/><br/>In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, elephants remain widely but very patchily distributed in forested areas, both in the highlands and lowlands. Two important and likely viable populations are known, one in Xaignaboli Province west of the Mekong and one on the Nakai Plateau. Other potentially important elephant populations occur in Phou Phanang and Phou Khao Khoay in Vientiane Province; Phou Xang He in Savannakhet Province; Dong Ampham and Dong Khanthung, including Xe Pian, close to Cambodian border; and Nam Et, Nam Xam, Phou Dendin, and Nam Ha in the north, close to the Viet Namese and Chinese borders.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, only a small population persists now. In the northern part of the country there are no elephants left, barring occasional wanderers into Son La from Lao PDR. In the central and southern parts of the country, very small isolated populations remain in Dak Lak, Nghe An, Quang Nam, Dong Nai, and Ha Tinh Provinces. <br/><br/>In China, Asian elephants once ranged widely over much of southern China, including the Fujiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). The species was extirpated in southern Fujiang and northern Guangdong during the 12th century, but evidence indicates persistence in Guanxi into the 17th century (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). All that now remains of this once widespread elephant population in China is the remnant in Yunnan where the species survives in three prefectures: Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang.<br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, the species is still widely distributed in the interior of the country in the following States: Pahang (which probably has the largest population), Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Negeri Sembilan (where very few animals remain).<br/><br/>On Borneo, elephants only occur in the lowlands of the northeastern part of the island in the Malaysian State of Sabah and adjacent parts of Kalimantan (Indonesia). In Sabah, they occur in forested areas in the south, centre, and east of the State in the following Districts: Kinabatangan, Sandakan, Beluran, Lahad Datu, Tawau, and Pensiangan. In Kalimantan, elephants occur only in the Upper Sembakung River in Tindung District. The origin of the elephants of Borneo remains unclear and the subject of debate. Due to the limited distribution of the island’s elephant population it is argued by some that the species was not indigenous, but descended from imported captive elephants (Medway 1977; Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008). However, others argues that while captive elephants have undoubtedly been brought to Borneo, genetic analyses have shown that the elephants found on Borneo are genetically distinct, with molecular divergence indicating a Pleistocene colonization and subsequent isolation (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2003)<br/><br/>On Sumatra (in Indonesia), the elephant was once widespread, but now survives only in highly fragmented populations. In the mid-1980s, 44 discrete elephant populations were known to exist in Sumatra’s eight provinces, 12 of these were in Lampung Province (Blouch and Haryanto, 1984; Blouch and Simbolon, 1985). However, by 2003, only three of Lampung’s 12 populations were extant (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). An unknown number of Sumatra’s other elephant populations remain (Blake and Hedges, 2004), and those that do are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and as a result of conflict with humans (Santiapillai and Jackson, 1990; Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). Nevertheless, the island is thought to hold some of the most significant populations outside of India. For example, recent surveys in Lampung Province’s two national parks, Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas, produced population estimates of 498 (95% CI=[373, 666]) and 180 (95% CI=[144, 225]) elephants, respectively (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). Bukit Barisan Selatan NP is therefore a critically important area for Asian elephant conservation. The challenge now is to protect these populations from further habitat loss and poaching.","The Asian elephant is hunted for ivory, food, leather and other products. Live animals are also removed from the wild and used in forestry operations and for ceremonial purposes.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. The most important conservation priorities for the Asian elephant are: 1) conservation of the elephant's habitat and maintaining habitat connectivity by securing corridors; 2) the management of human–elephant conflicts as part of an integrated land-use policy that recognizes elephants as economic assets from which local people need to benefit or at least no suffer; 3) better protection to the species through improved legislation and law enforcement, improved and enhanced field patrolling, and regulating/curbing trade in ivory and other elephant products. Monitoring of conservation interventions is also needed to assess the success or failure of the interventions so that adjustments can be made as necessary (i.e. adaptive management). Reliable estimation of population size and trends will be needed as part of this monitoring and adaptive management approach.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Consequently the species is assessed as Endangered under Criterion D in the Mediterranean region.</p>","Asiatic Wild Ass inhabit mountain steppe, steppe, semi-desert and desert plains. They are usually found in desert steppe. Typically they are grazers and in Mongoia (Gobi B) throughout the year they eat <em>Stipa glareosa</em>, <em>Agropyron cristatum</em> and <em>Achnatherum</em> (<em>Feh</em> 2001). They can be found in rocky or sandy areas associated with <em>Artemisia</em>, grasses, <em>Anabasis</em> spp., Russian thistle (<em>Salsola</em> spp.), saxaul (<em>Haloxylon ammodendron</em>) and pea shrubs (<em>Caragana</em> spp.) (Harris and Miller 1995, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001). To date, there have been few detailed studies of Asiatic Wild Ass feeding ecology. However, observations suggest a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Ass are predominately grazers. During dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Ass will browse a large portion of their diet. While Asiatic Wild Ass eat woody plants, other forage is taken when possible. Animals have been observed eating seed pods (Shah 1993) and using their hooves to break up woody vegetation to obtain more succulent forbs growing at the base of the woody plants. Herds can number up to 1,200 individuals. Water sources are an important determinant of distribution; in summer months the species occurs within 10-15 km of standing water, and this range increases five-fold in winter when it is not restricted by water availability. In Mongolia, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water, eating snow during winter as a substitute (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002; Stubbe <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Ass weigh approximately 200-260 kg. Gestation is 11 months and breeding is seasonal. Peak birthing season occurs between April and September - within any one subpopulation, births tend to occur over a two to three month span with a peak between mid June and mid July (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002).<br/><br/>There have been a number of studies on social organisation and behavioural ecology of Asiatic asses. These studies have been conducted on several of the Asiatic Wild Ass populations throughout their range. While the explanations and terminology describing the species' mating system do not necessarily coincide, there are similarities in the observations. In all studies, breeding is seasonal and females with young tend to group together in relatively small groups (two to five females). Descriptions of male breeding strategies differ considerably (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002). <br/><br/>Early studies were mostly descriptive. Both Solomatins and Rasheks long term studies based mostly on individual follow-ups described a harem type social structure in Turkmene Kulan harem-style behaviour (Bannikov 1958, Solomatin 1973, Rashek 1973) whereas Klingel's one week observations described a territorial system. Bannikov's short term survey in Mongolia described harems or family groups.  Both harem-style behaviour (Bannikov 1958, Solomatin 1973, Rashek 1973) and territorial defence (Klingel 1977) social systems were described. Since 1980, several detailed studies have been carried out on various subspecies: Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch (Shah 1993), Kulan in Mongolia (Feh <em>et al</em>. 1994, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the reintroduced Kulan/Onager hybrids in Israel (Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Saltz <em>et al</em>. 2000). Two studies, Shah (1993) and Saltz <em>et al</em>. (2000), describe systems in which individual stallions either defend territories or form all-male groups. Four social units are identified in Khur; family group, stallion, all male group and displaced stallion (Shah and Qureshi 2007). Stallions in the Rann of Kutch exhibit both seasonal and year-round territoriality with females, forming small seasonal harems (Shah 1993, Shah and Qureshi, 2007). Territorial stallions defend territories throughout the year in the Rann of Kutch. Females remain on territories during the breeding season (monsoon season), with some females remaining on one territory and others moving between territories (Shah 1993, Shah and Qureshi, 2007). A few mares continue to remain on territories all year round. Shah (1993) refers to the two groupings as year-round and seasonal harems. The term ""harem"" maybe misleading here, as the stallion behaviour describes resource defence rather than guarding of females, and the ""item"" at stake is land. Shah (1993) states that ""the quality of the territory seems to be a prime determinant of dominance"". This is similar to territory stallion dominance witnessed in Grévy's zebra (Ginsberg 1989). Within the Rann of Kutch, female movements were often limited to single territories, thereby creating ""harem-like"" female groupings (Shah 1993). However, females are able to move freely between territories, thereby describing a system in which female movement adapts to changing resource availability, as well as mate preference. <em>Khur</em> have territorial harem type social organization (Shah and Qureshi 2007). Rainfall and productivity of food resources  determine the <em>khur</em> recruitment and population growth rate (Shah and Qureshi 2007).<br/><br/>Similar social behaviour has been documented in the reintroduced population of wild asses in the Negev, Israel. The study in Israel is unique in that it has documented a growing population of all known individual females and territorial stallions. The study has followed  the population from having one territorial stallion to more than seven. Males return to the main breeding area (an area with  permanent water sources) each spring, several weeks before the females return (Saltz <em>et al</em>. 2000). The majority of males return to the same territories that they held in previous years; non-territorial males either form small all-male groups in the breeding area or remain in the winter grazing areas. Females return within a few weeks and foal almost immediately. Females form groups on territories but group membership remains fluid. This fission-fusion social system (Rubenstein 1986, Rubenstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) has some females remaining on one territory throughout the breeding season while others switch territories regularly.<br/><br/>In the Gobi B National Park (Mongolia), both Bannikov (1958) and Feh <em>et al</em>. (1994, 2001) suggest that Kulan social behaviour is similar to that of feral horses. Feh <em>et al</em>. (1994, 2001) describe family groups consisting of individual males with several females and their foals moving to and from water sources, but the study is based on only a small number of identified individuals. In addition, stallions were observed to herd females. This behaviour is similar to that found in feral horses (although some of the specific postures differed) and is not common among the other subspecies studied. <em>Khur</em> have territorial harem where stallions defend resources and benefit from having access to mares on these territories (Shah 1993, Shah and Qureshi 2007). In Gobi B, stallions were observed to defend both females and foals from predators (Feh <em>et al</em>. 1994). Feh <em>et al</em>. (1994, 2001) suggest that khulan behaviour in Gobi B is different from other populations as a direct response to predation pressure from cooperatively hunting wolves.<br/><br/>Further study of known individuals is necessary to fully understand the social behaviour of Asiatic wild ass. It is likely that differences in social structure and behaviour depend on climatic seasonality, vegetation cover, and predator hunting pressures. Additional clarification of social structure and the factors that influence animal movement and behaviour (e.g. climatic and anthropogenic factors, grazing pressure, etc.) can provide a helpful tool in understanding threats to individual populations. The studies briefly outlined above demonstrate that there is a great deal of flexibility within the species' social structure. With increasing levels of desertification and habitat fragmentation, all the above and future studies should be consulted in the formation of habitat and species conservation plans Feh <em>et al</em> 2002, Rubenstein <em>et al</em>. 2007).","Threats to the species include loss of habitat as a result of human settlement, cultivation, overgrazing, developmental activities, conflict with humans (crop depredation), competition for water, salt extraction, poaching for meat, competition with domestic livestock and, in certain parts of the range, war and civil unrest have had a detrimental effect on the species (Clark and Duncan 1992; Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). Perhaps the greatest threat to the populations of Asiatic Wild Ass appears to be the potential for catastrophic population declines due to poaching (i.e., <em>kulan</em> in Turkmenistan and <em>hemionus</em> in Mongolia). Disease and/or drought are ""stress events"" that are a constant threat to small, isolated Wild Ass populations, such as those in India, Iran, Israel, and Turkmenistan. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963). Continued fragmentation and marginalisation of the smaller populations could result in similar extinctions. Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:<br/><br/>The main threats to the Onager (<em>Equus hemionus onager</em>) in Iran are, in decreasing order of severity, poaching, overgrazing, competition for water, and removal of shrubs (Tatin <em>et al</em>. 2001). Tatin <em>et al</em>. (2001) identified the main threats to the Onager population at Touran, and outlined the actions being implemented to combat them. Both the Touran and Bahramgor populations are geographically, and therefore genetically, isolated from each other.<br/><br/>The Khur (<em>Equus hemionus khur</em>) in the Little Rann of Kutch is the subspecies subject to the most direct threat from increasing human activities. The ecology of the Wild Ass Sanctuary, for example, is threatened by a canal building project - the Sardar Sarovar Project of the Narmada Development Authority (Goyal <em>et al</em>. 1999). There is growing competition for resources as an increasing number of livestock are grazed within the reserve during monsoon season. At the same time, salt mining, the major economic industry for local people, has increased 140% since 1958 (Shah 1993). Such increased activity is particularly disruptive as the period for salt mining coincides with advanced stage of pregnancy in the Khur (Shah 1993). The increase in Khur population and its range expansion into the human dominated landscapes has resulted in increased incidences of crop depredation. Agriculture has intensified with better irrigation facilities thus changing the land use patterns.<br/><br/>The Kulan (<em>Equus hemionus kulan</em>) has suffered a catastrophic decline in the late 1990s due to poaching for the sale of meat (Lukarevskii pers. comm. 2001, Feh <em>et al</em> 2002). The only naturally occurring population of this subspecies is in the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan. During the summer months this population migrates to the Kuska River, which is 100&#160;km outside of the protected area. The critical situation of the Badkhys Reserve Kulans clearly illustrates how swiftly isolated equid populations can be decimated and potentially driven to extinction during a period of a few years.<br/><br/>The Mongolian Kulan (<em>Equus hemionus hemionus</em>) is suffering from illegal hunting for meat and skins, for commercial use in some areas (Duncan 1992; Stubbe <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stubbe <em>et al</em> 2007). Habitat is being degraded through human settlements such as herder camps which restrict access to oases, resource extraction such as mining, and possibly though grazing by increasing numbers of domestic livestock, particularly domestic horses and sheep. Habitat fragmentation and restriction of wide-scale movements due to fencing is a significant problem along the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway and the China-Mongolia border (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2006, in prep.), and is also caused by roads, fences and railway lines associated with resource extraction activities. Nomadic herdsmen in Mongolia claim that an increasing number of Kulan are damaging the rangeland (Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997). In part, wildlife-livestock competition may result from an increased number of livestock following Mongolia's shift to a market economy (e.g., livestock  numbers increased from 24.6 million head to 28.6 million head between 1989 and  1995 (Honhold 1995, Müller and Janzen 1997, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). The negative impacts of grazing in Mongolia are well documented, especially where wild and domestic livestock overlap (Honhold 1995, Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em>. 1987). Increased competition with livestock may result in further fragmentation of the wild ass population by limiting Kulan to strictly protected areas. In addition to competition for grazing land, poaching for meat and hides poses an increasing threat to Kulan in Mongolia (Duncan 1992, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). High levels of hunting in the 1980s severely decreased kulan populations in inner Mongolia. Xiaoming and Schaller (1996) found very few Kulan further than 100&#160;km from the Chinese/Mongolia border, suggesting that the inner Mongolian population is only a seasonal expansion of the Mongolian population. Wingard and Zahler (2006) reported that the illegal trade in Mongolian Kulan is removing approximately 3,000 individuals per year from the population. This level of exploitation is not sustainable.","During the past century the total population and range of Asiatic Wild Ass has declined significantly (Clark and Duncan 1992, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>The largest remaining subspecies population is the Mongolian Khulan (<em>E. h. hemionus</em>) which was estimated in 2003 at 18,411 +/- 898 in four areas (Lkhagvasuren  2007). Southern Mongolia currently holds the largest population of Asiatic Wild Ass in the world, representing almost 80% of the global population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, this population is at risk due to illegal hunting and numbers have declined significantly from an estimated population size of 43,165 in 1997 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). There may be as many as 4,800 to 6,000 Khulan in the Kalameili Reserve in China, but this may be a seasonal population that is migrating from Mongolia (Pantel <em>et al</em> 2006). Offtake for the illegal meat trade is estimated at 3,000 individuals per year. Recruitment (number of offspring) varies from 3-23%. The potential net loss per year may be 5-10%. In 21 years or 3 generations, the population decline will be greater than 50%. If illegal hunting continues in Mongolia, the potential decline of this important population will be 5-10% per year. The Kulan population in Turkmenistan is also at risk due to illegal hunting.<br/><br/>The next largest subpopulation is the Indian Khur (<em>E. h. khur</em>) with an estimated population in 2004 of 3,900 in the Little Rann of Kutch (Shah and Qureshi 2007). This is the only subpopulation of Asiatic Wild Ass that has had a steady increase in population size since 1976 to the present. The population increase is associated with range expansion, <em>khur</em> has occupied areas beyond ~200 km away from its source population in Little Rann of Kutch (Shah and Qureshi 2007). <br/><br/>The Kulan (<em>E. h. kulan</em>) populations in 2005 were approximately 1,300 in Turkmenistan (Badkhys Reserve  850-900 and seven reintroduction sites (445) (Lukarevskiy and Gorelov 2007) The Kulan has experienced a recent dramatic decline in its main population in Turkmenistan. The population in the Badkhyz Preserve declined from 6,000 in 1993, to 2,400 in 1998 to 646 in 2000 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). From 1995 to 2000 the estimated number of Kulan in reintroduction sites was approximately 320. In 1992 the reintroduced populations in Kazakhstan were Barsa-Khelmes Island : 96 ; Aktau-Busatchinski: uncertain; Andasaiski reserve: 164 ; Kaptchagaiskoye: 150 for a total of 410. In 1999, the reintroduced populations in Kazakhstan in these four sites was approximately 900 animals (Pereladova and Baidavletov pers. com. 2006). The reintroduced population in Uzbekistan in Dzheiran Ecocentre was 34 in 1991 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Information on the status of the Onager in Iran (<em>E. h. onager</em>) is limited, but recent estimates are 600 in the two protected areas (L. Shamimi, pers.com. 2007). There were 471 animals in Touran National Park in 2000, and 96 in Bahramgor Reserve in 1996, with four re-introduced animals in Yazd Province in 2000 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). There were also five <em>E. h. onager</em> in Taïf (Saudi Arabia) in 2000, and the hybrid <em>E. h. onager</em> x <em>E. h. kulan</em> population in Israel numbered 100 in 2000.<br/><br/>The global population of mature Asiatic Wild Ass has declined by 52% population in the last 16 years. It occurs in 14 locations and is severely fragmented. Generation length in <em>Equus hemionus</em> is seven years, age at first reproduction for females is 5 years, females produce one live foal every three years, sex-ratio at birth is 50/50, first year survival rate is approximately 50%, second year survival rate is approximately 50%, and only half of the stallions reproduce, yielding an approximately one-third of the population being ""mature individuals"" (Feh <em>et al</em> 2001). The current estimated number of mature individuals is 8358. The estimated global population decline in the future is &gt;50% due to illegal hunting.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged through much of Mongolia, north to Transbaikalia (Russia), east to northeastern Inner Mongolia (China) and possibly western Manchuria (China), and west to Dzhungarian Gate (Grubb 2005). It formerly occurred in Kazakhstan, north to the upper Irtysh and Ural Rivers in Russia, and westward north of the Caucasus and Black Sea to at least the Dniestr River (Ukraine), Anatolia (Turkey), Syria, and southeast of the Caspian Sea in Iran, northern Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, east to Thar Desert of northwestern India (Grubb 2005). It also extended through the Arabian Peninsula as far south as central Saudi Arabia. It survived in Armenia and Azerbaijan until 17th-18th Centuries (Wolfe 1979). The Syrian Wild Ass became extinct in 1927.<br/><br/>By the 19th Century, their range had declined significantly. Today, the most abundant subpopulation of the species occurs in the southern part of Mongolia and adjacent northern China (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Rann of Kutch (India), the Badkhyz Preserve (Turkmenistan) and at Touran National Park and Bahramgor Reserve (Iran) (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). Populations have been re-established as follows: Barsa-Khelmes Island in the Aral Sea (Kazakhstan); Aktay-Buzachinskiy reserve on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea (Kazakhstan); Andasayskiy reserve and Kapchagayskoye in southeastern Kazakhstan; Dzheiran Ecocentre near Bukhara (Uzbekistan); Meana-Chaacha, Kaakha, Kopet Dag, and Sumbar Valley in southern Turkmenistan (re-introduced populations in Kurtusu and Germab perhaps no longer survive); Sarakamish Lake in northern Turkmenistan; the Beruchi Peninsula (Ukraine), the Negev (southern Israel), and Taïf (Saudi Arabia) (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). The re-established populations in Ukraine, Israel and Saudi Arabia are not of the subspecies that originally occurred there (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>There are five generally recognized subspecies (Grubb 2005):<br/><em>Equus h. hemionus</em> - the Mongolian Kulan (in northern Mongolia) (<em>E. h. luteus</em> - the Gobi Kulan in southern Mongolia and northern China, is probably a synonym of <em>E. h. hemionus</em> (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2000, Grubb 2005))<br/><em>E. h. khur</em> - the Khur (India)<br/><em>E. h. kulan</em> the Turkmen Kulan (in Turkmenistan, re-introduced in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine)<br/><em>E. h. onager</em> - the Onager (Iran, introduced in Saudi Arabia)<br/><em>E. h. hemippus</em> - the Syrian Wild Ass (Extinct, formerly from Syria south into the Arabian Peninsula)<br/>The reintroduced population in Israel is of hybrid origin (<em>E. h. onager</em> and <em>E. h. kulan</em>).<br/><br/>The largest surviving subpopulation, the Mongolian Kulan (<em>Equus h. hemionus</em>)  is in Mongolia, where it was formerly widely distributed throughout steppe and semi-desert habitats, from the extreme west of the country to the Mongolian-Russian-Chinese border in the extreme northeast (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Asiatic Wild Ass has experienced a major decline in population size and range size, even in Mongolia (Bannikov 1981) and they are now only found in the Trans Altai Gobi Desert, the Northern Gobi, the Alashani Gobi Desert and the Dzungarian Gobi Desert (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002), as far north as Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve in the Eastern Gobi (S. Amgalanbaatar and R. Reading pers. obs.). Recent evidence suggests that the population has either expanded or shifted further north and east over the past 20-25 years, but rarely crosses the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway line (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. in prep.). There are important populations in the Great Gobi Section B Strictly Protected Area, in Dzungarian Gobi, and the Great Gobi Section A Strictly Protected Area in Trans Altai Govi Desert (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002, Stubbe <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/><br/>The Khur <em>Equus hemionus khur</em> was formerly widespread in the arid zone of northwestern India and Pakistan, westwards through much of central Asia. However, it is now limited to the Little Rann of Kutch  in Gujarat, India. The khur probably went extinct in Baluchistan and the extreme south of Pakistan, on the Indian border, during the 1960s (Corbet and Hill 1992). There are some recent records of Khur along India-Pakistan border. During the last two decades Khur has shown range expansion along with an increase in their population (Shah 2004).",,Terrestrial,"This species is legally protected in Mongolia, Turkmenistan, Iran and India. In Mongolia it is protected as Rare under the 2001 revision (Mongolian Government Act No. 264) of the 2000 Law of the Mongolian Animal Kingdom (MNE 1996). Hunting has been prohibited since 1953, and it is currently listed as Rare under the 1995 Mongolian Hunting Law (MNE 1996). It is listed as Rare in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em>. 1987; MNE 1997). <em>Equus hemionus hemionus</em> and <em>E. h. khur</em> are included in CITES Appendix I, with the other subspecies being on CITES Appendix II. The species is included in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The species occurs in protected areas in all range states where it survives. Approximately 29% of the species' range in Mongolia occurs within protected areas (Clark <em>et al</em> 2006).<br/><br/>As outlined in the section on geographic distribution, there have been re-introduction projects for this species in a number of countries, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Ukraine, Israel and Saudi Arabia. In an effort to increase the total number of kulan populations, animals from the Badkhys and Barsa Kelmes were translocated to other areas in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbzekistan between 1955 and 1991 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Recognizing the threatened status of the dwindling Kulan population in the 1940s, the Soviet government gazetted the 900 km² Badkhyz Preserve in Turkmenistan to protect the remaining 200 Kulan. The population consequently grew to approximately 6,000 animals between 1945 and 1993. However, in the late 1990s when the Kulans left  the reserve during the summer months, they were killed in large numbers. The population was significantly reduced to approximately 600 animals. This history illustrates how quickly a healthy population of equids can be reduced to a critically endangered level. <br/><br/>To date, the introduction of <em>E. hemionus</em> in Israel has been successful. The animals were introduced in 1982. Due to a high percentage of male births, the population grew very slowly at first (Saltz and Rubenstein 1996). Starting in 1991, the population began to grow more quickly with 17 births in 1994. As of the 1997 birth season, there were approximately 105 animals, of which 31 were adult breeding females. The animals are found over an area of 4,500 km². The animals use three artificial water points that are maintained by the Israeli Nature Reserves Authority in addition to several natural  springs. Detailed ongoing studies of the population examine population increase, range expansion, habitat use, and changes in vegetation density and species richness. Information from these studies will be used in the development of management plans for the population (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002).<br/><br/>There are some important research needs for this species. A large omission in our knowledge of the Asiatic Wild Ass is its status and distribution within China. In Turkmenistan and Iran, the management of the Onager and Kulan would greatly benefit from increased knowledge of basic behaviour and ecology. Such information would provide a better understanding of threats to these populations. In particular, as the potential for escalating human-wildlife conflict increases during droughts, a short-term study to understand the seasonal movement patterns of the Badkhyz Kulan population in Turkmenistan, and the places where conflicts are taking place, might help to address how best to protect this population. <br/><br/>In Mongolia, the following conservation measures are in place:<br/>- In 1999, the Mongolian Government created two protected areas specifically for the conservation of this species, Great Gobi Section B Strictly Protected Area (Dzungarian Gobi Desert) and Zagiin Us Nature Reserve (Northern Gobi) (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/>- Research projects have been conducted to investigate the status, distribution, ecology and social structure of Asiatic Wild Ass in Mongolia (e.g., Feh <em>et al</em>., 2001; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/>- Several conservation organizations were brought together at the ""First Asiatic Wild Ass Conference"" held in Mongolia in 2005 (AWAC 2005), where a range of conservation management issues were addressed.<br/>- An in-depth study of the ecological impact of the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway has been conducted, including trials using Mongolian Gazelles to investigate the possibility of their crossing bridges or tunnels. This research may also benefit Asiatic Wild Ass migration.<br/>- Activities in Great Gobi Section B Strictly Protected Area include: monthly wildlife transects, monitoring of Asiatic Wild Ass and other species such as wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Przewalski's Horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>) to understand interactions, vegetation mapping, and workshops to integrate park management with sustainable livelihoods (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/> <br/>The following five actions are now those deemed most important for this species (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002):<br/><br/>1. The Kulan population in Badkhys Preserve has declined by approximately 90% in a three year period. Improved protection from poaching is needed both within the reserve and along the summer migration route to the Kushka River. The ecological requirements of this population need to be determined and an ecosystem analysis made of their habitat in order to prepare a long-term sustainable management plan.<br/><br/>2. Over 30% of the Khur population is ranging outside the Protected Area. The Sardar Sarovar Canal has changed the land-use patterns and the agro-economy i.e. from rain dependent crops to irrigated cash crops. Around the Rann, mitigation measures for the increasing number of wildlife and human conflicts are urgently needed. <em>Prosopis juliflora</em>, is an exotic shrub spreading fast across the habitat, the management needs to undertake thinning operation of this shrub for habitat improvement. Salt mining is the major economy for eight months in the year for the locals living around the Rann. This area produces 21% of India's salt. The transportation of the salt is through well-defined routes. Presently truckers criss-cross through the area (habitat) thereby causing excessive damage to fragile arid grasslands (Shah 1993). The Sardar Sarovar canal has fragmented the Khur population. There is a need to evaluate possible linkages between the fragmented Khur population and its source Rann population. There is a need to understand the demography and immigration patterns of Khur in the newly occupied sites (i.e., Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, Velavadar Blackbuck National Park, areas in Bhal, Great Rann and neigbouring state of Rajasthan) (Shah 1993, 1998, 1999). The existing sanctuary infrastructure and staffing needs to be strengthened which is presently inadequate for managing a Sanctuary of 5,000 km² (Shah 1993). There is a need for disease monitoring of domestic equids and other livestock.  The sanctuary was notified in 1973, and the land settlement process has been initiated. The sanctuary has been identified as a potential Natural World Heritage Site; its evaluation is pending (Gujarat Forest Department 2007). There is a need for an assessment of the status of Khur along the Indo-Pakistan border adjoining the Rann. The Wild Ass Sanctuary was identified as one of the six landscape sites in India for biodiversity conservation through improved rural livelihoods, a programme which is aided by the World Bank (Government of India 2007).<br/><br/>3. Taxonomic questions need to be clarified and subspecies ranges should be demarcated. These data are needed for the Wild Ass subspecies in Mongolia and for the Kulan/Onager populations in Turkmenistan and Iran. Information from the latter investigation could also affect the taxonomic listing of the introduced Israeli population.<br/><br/>4. Investigation and development of plans are needed to address conflict between local human groups and Wild Ass populations. Today, grazing outside reserves and encroachment into agricultural areas threaten to decrease ""good-will"" towards Asiatic Wild Ass populations in Turkmenistan and Mongolia. Whether now or in the future, all Wild Ass populations will probably be in conflict with local pastoralists and agricultural groups. Conflict with human populations will lead to loss of habitat quality and increased susceptibility to high mortality during drought and disease outbreaks. Efforts need to be made to address current problems and to limit their occurrence in the future. In addition, the following conservation measures have been identified specifically for Mongolia (AWAC 2005):<br/><br/>- Enhance enforcement of existing protective legislature, including strict control at border posts between Mongolia and China for illegal export of carcasses.<br/>- Control meat markets, to prevent illegal trade in carcasses within Mongolia.<br/>- Map critical habitat and movement corridors.<br/>- Consider migration routes when planning transportation routes and fences, including implementation of mitigation measures along fenced transportation routes (e.g., railway Ulaanbaatar-Beijing) (P. Kaczensky pers. comm.).<br/>- Raise public awareness and establish education programmes to highlight the international importance and socioeconomic benefits of Mongolian populations (e.g., teach herders that they benefit from Asiatic Wild Ass digging waterholes in dry riverbeds) (C. Feh pers. comm.).<br/>- Livelihood aid for local people, e.g., alternative income strategies. Conflict between local pastoralists and agricultural groups needs to  be addressed.<br/>- Conduct further research on population numbers, habitat use and migration, including further research to clarify the subspecific taxonomy of Mongolian populations of Asiatic Wild Ass (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002), and rigorous annual population monitoring, preferentially using aerial surveys.<br/>- Stronger co-operation between Mongolia and China to facilitate conservation efforts, e.g. formation of trans-border protected areas.",Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean
12882660,8010,Erignathus barbatus,Not Applicable,,2007,2007-02-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is a vagrant in the marine region covered by the European Mammal Assessment, consequently it is classed as Not Applicable.","Bearded seals are the largest phocids in the Arctic. Adults reach lengths of 2-2.5m and weights of 250-300 kg (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1999) with females typically being slightly larger than males (Kovacs 2002). In the Bering Sea, males have been recorded to reach 390 kg and females 361 kg (Kelly 1988). Sexual maturity is reached at 3-6 years in females, with 80% of females having had a pup by age 6. Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Kelly 1988).  Physical maturity occurs at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958), and they can live 20-25 years (Kovacs 2002). Bearded seal pups are born on the sea ice, but they swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2002), and before they are weaned they are spending about half their time in the water. <br/><br/>Bearded seals primarily feed on or near the bottom, and most diving is to depths of less than 100m (Kovacs 2002).  Therefore they live primarily in waters overlying the continental shelf, like much of the relatively shallow Bering Sea when it is seasonally covered with ice (Burns 1981).  Adults have been recorded to dive to nearly 300 m, and young pups to over 488 m (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Ice is also a determinant of habitat. Bearded seals are typically found away from shore-fast ice and unbroken heavily covered ice fields, preferring areas with moving ice where ice movement, currents, weather and land features interact to create broken ice fields, leads, polynas, and other open areas (Burns 1981).  They rarely haul out more than a body length from water (Kovacs 2002).  Bearded seals are typically solitary animals, but will form loose aggregations when ice availability is low (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>The diet of bearded seals varies by age, location, season, and possibly changes in prey availability in marine communities over long time periods (Kelly 1988).  Their primary foods live on or near the bottom, but also include some infauna and schooling and demersal fish (Burns 1981). At Svalbard, bearded seals took a wide variety of prey and over half of the stomachs examined had 5 or more species. Arctic cod, found in 44% of the animals, sculpins (Cottidae spp.) in 44%, spider crab (<em>Hyas araneus</em>) in 59%, and the crustaceans <em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus</em> 59% and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em> 46%, were the most frequently found prey items (Hjelset <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>In June, following the pupping and breeding season, bearded seals undergo their annual molt. During the molt they spend much of their time hauled out, and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004). Animals can be found molting from April to August with a peak in May to June (Burns 1981). Bearded seals usually haul out on ice when it is available, but will haul out on land in the summer in the Sea of Okhotsk, along the Laptev, White, and Kara Sea coastlines (Burns 1981), and at Svalbard (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Important natural predators of bearded seals include polar bears (Burns 1981), as well as killer whales, walruses, and Greenland sharks (Kovacs 2002).","Native Peoples of the Arctic have hunted bearded seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today (Burns 1981). Overall levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. The former Soviet Union had commercial harvests in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering, Chukchi, Barents, and White Seas historically, and harvest levels were at times high. Harvest levels grew from 9,000 to 13,000 from 1957 to 1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year for the Bering and Okhotsk Seas combined from 1964-1967 (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992).  This commercial over-harvesting probably depleted the population (Kelly 1988).  Bearded seals are now harvested more on a subsistence basis for local use in Russia, although some seals are killed as food for fur-farm animals (Kelly 1988), and are primarily taken from the Bering Sea where harvests of 1,881 and 1,418 were reported for 1988 and 1989 respectively (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992).<br/><br/>Fisheries interactions appear to be low. Logbooks indicate 14 bearded seals killed and 31 injured in 1991 in the Bristol Bay, Alaska salmon drift net fishery. There were several incidents of incidental take, serious injury, or mortality each in the Alaskan Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands flatfish and pollock trawl fisheries respectively from 1999-2003, when annual mortality was estimated at 1.58 seals (Angliss and Outlaw 2005).  <br/><br/>Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect bearded seals through direct contact with oil, and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, which respond poorly to oil contamination (Kelly 1988).<br/><br/>Arctic climate change that is currently leading to reduction in the extent and duration of sea ice cover is a threat to many species of marine mammals.  Patterns of Arctic primary productivity and population levels of prey species important to Arctic marine mammals may be altered as a consequence of Arctic warming and changes in sea ice. Pinnipeds, such as the bearded seal that are dependant on sea ice for pupping, molting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Tynan and DeMaster 1997). In contrast, Stirling and Derocher (1993) suggest that climatic warming could result in more favorable conditions for bearded, harp, and harbor seals, and walruses if it causes sea ice to become less consolidated in winter, and the summer open water period to lengthen.<br/><br/>An increase in human-created noise in the Arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including bearded seals which are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997).  A reduction in sea ice cover would likely lead to increased human activity in the Arctic in the form of shipping and extractive industries, and an associated greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals (Pagnan 2000).  <br/><br/>Harp seals, hooded seals, and ringed seals from the Canadian Arctic, where they share habitat with bearded seals, were all determined to carry antibodies to phocine distemper virus (PDV), with harp seals constituting the population with the largest percentage (83%) of positive tests.  Although the disease has not been identified in bearded seals, the opportunity for exposure exists (Duignan <em>et al.</em> 1997).","The worldwide population of bearded seals is unknown (Kovacs 2002). Portions of the range have the following abundance estimates: 200,000-250,000 in the Sea of Okhotsk, including 60,000-75,000 off eastern Sakhalin Island for the period 1968 to 1990, and 250,000-300,000 in the Bering Sea, including 83,000-87,000 in the western Bering Sea (Fedoseev 2000). A minimum estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period. Angliss and Outlaw (2005) state that there are no current reliable population estimates for the Bering Chukchi stock of bearded seals. No estimates exist for the population in the Atlantic Ocean (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993), or Barents to Chukchi seas area.",Unknown,"Bearded seals have a circumpolar distribution in the Arctic and sub-Arctic south of 85 degrees North, usually in water less than 200 m deep (Kelly 1988). A disjunct population inhabits the Sea of Okhotsk, ranging south to Hokkaido, Japan (Rice 1998). They reach the southern Bering Sea and Bristol Bay to the limit of seasonally ice covered waters (Kelly 1988). They also occupy all of Hudson Bay, and range south to Southern Labrador, and northern Iceland and Norway (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Bearded seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal in the eastern North Atlantic (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts in the western North Atlantic (Gosselin and Boily 1994).<br/><br/>The ranges of the two subspecies are divided near the central Canadian Arctic in the Western Hemisphere, and Laptev Sea in the Eastern Hemisphere, with the Atlantic subspecies barbatus occurring from the central Canadian Arctic east to the central Eurasian Arctic, and Pacific subspecies nauticus occurring from the Laptev Sea east to the central Canadian Arctic, including animals in the Sea of Okhotsk (Rice 1998).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Bearded seals are protected by various laws in their range countries and by treaties internationally.  Subsistence hunting by Native People of the Arctic is generally for personal use and not regulated, for example, as in Canada and the United States (Cleator 1996, Angliss and Outlaw 2005).<br/><br/>Vessel-based commercial hunting in the former Soviet Union ended in 1975 and the harvest continues at much lower levels, more like a subsistence harvest.  Prior to the end of commercial harvesting, the Soviet Union used a system of quotas to regulate the take in an attempt to manage the population (Kelly 1988).  Licensed hunters can take bearded seals in Svalbard, but not in nature reserves or during the breeding season (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe
12918931,60354712,Felis silvestris,Least Concern,,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Wild Cat is the most common and widely distributed wild cat, and thus listed as Least Concern.  However, hybridization with domestic cats is extensive, and taking place almost across the entire range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2004, Phelan and Sliwa 2006, Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2007).  Further research on hybridization levels may warrant a re-assessment of the wildcat as a threatened species, due to population declines of genetically pure wildcats, under criterion A4e.","Wildcats are found in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts and scrub grassland to dry and mixed forest, absent only from rainforest and coniferous forest.  European wildcats are primarily associated with forest and are found in highest numbers in broad-leaved or mixed forests with low densities of humans. They are also found in Mediterranean maquis scrubland, riparian forest, marsh boundaries and along sea coasts. Areas of intensive cultivation are avoided. African wildcats are found everywhere outside tropical rainforest, although thinly distributed in true desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The Chinese alpine steppe cat is restricted to the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau, and is found primarily in alpine meadow habitats from 2,500 to 5,000 m (He <em>et al.</em> 2004).  Yu <em>et al.</em> (2007) obtained the first camera trap photos of a wild individual at 3,700 m.  Asiatic wildcats have a different elevational range (up to 2,000-3,000 m), and are most typically associated with scrub desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  <br/><br/>Rodents and rabbits are the staple of the wildcat's diet across its range, with birds of secondary importance, although a variety of small prey is taken, and wildcats also scavenge (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Phelan and Sliwa (2006) found large home ranges (52.7 km² for a radio-collared female) in desert habitat in the United Arab Emirates, larger than home ranges reported elsewhere in more optimal haibtat - 6-10 km² for females in South Africa's Kalahari Gemsbok National Park (Herbst and Mills 2005 in Stuart <em>et al.</em> in press) and 1-2 km² for females in Scotland and France (Stahl <em>et al.</em> 1988, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004).","Wildcats are most threatened by domestic cats.  Hybridization is widespread; there may be very few genetically pure populations of wildcats remaining (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004, Phelan and Sliwa 2006, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007).  Of all wildcat subspecies analyzed, only the Chinese alpine steppe cat <span style=""font-style: italic;"">F. s. bieti</span> showed no evidence of genetic introgression of domestic cat genes, but the sample size was small (Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007).  Feral cats compete with wildcats for prey and space, and there is also a high potential for disease transmission between domestic cats and wildcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Daniels <em>et al.</em> 1999, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004).  <br/><br/>Other threats include significant human-caused mortality, in Europe, especially road kills (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lüps <em>et al.</em> 2002, Schulenberg 2005). The species is still considered a pest in Scotland and is illegally persecuted (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004). Predator control measures in a number of European countries may result in this species being killed as bycatch.  Wildcats are also killed as pests in southern Africa although this does not seem to have resulted in population declines (Stuart <em>et al.</em> in press).  In the past Asiatic wildcats have been trapped in large numbers for their fur, although at present there is little international trade in Asian wildcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>Large-scale poisoning campaigns to try to control populations of small mammals such as pikas, voles and moles have been conducted in the habitat of the Chinese mountain cat.  Several different types of chemicals are in use which have been found to have adverse effects on predators. Although ecological methods of pest control have been urged by Chinese scientists, such campaigns continue and have eradicated potential prey such as pikas from large areas (Nowell and Jackson, 1996; He <em>et al.</em> 2004).  Skins of Chinese mountain cats have been encountered in small numbers in the illegal wildlife trade (Nowell and Jackson, 1996; He <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Historically, habitat loss led to dramatic declines in Europe and Russia in the 18th to mid 20th centuries (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004).  However, wildcats can do well in cultivated landscapes which increase rodent densities (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although these are the areas where hybridization with domestic cats occurs and spreads.","The world's population of domestic cats was estimated at 400 million twenty years ago (Legay 1986), making Felis silvestris one of the world's most numerous animals.  However, domestic cats hybridize readily with wildcats, and genetic analysis of wildcat samples found that most showed evidence of hybridization (Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007).  There are probably very few populations remaining of genetically pure wildcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Chinese alpine steppe cat, F.s. bieti, apparently has a very restricted range, and is the least numerous of the wildcats, classified as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>In the Near East region, wildcats occur at low density, and are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and egradation as well as hybridization (Phelan and Sliwa 2006).<br/><br/>Most detailed population information is available about the European subspecies, F.s. silvestris, although there is still a lack of information regarding its current status and population trends (Macdonald <em>et al. </em>2004). There have been no recent large-scale surveys or European regional reviews of the status of the species (Macdonald <em>et al. </em>2004). During the European Mammal Assessment process (IUCN 2007), information (ranging from detailed national surveys to expert opinion) was collated for a number of European range states and is presented here, but this is by no means a comprehensive review.  A review of the status of the wildcat in Europe in the 1980s and early-mid 1990s can be found in Stahl and Artois (1991) and Nowell and Jackson (1996).<br/><br/><strong>Scotland (UK)</strong>: Recent estimates have varied between 1,000 and 4,000 (compared to 1.2 million feral cats in Britain), but as few as 400 cats with classical wildcat pelage may survive, and it is possible that very few genetically pure wildcats remain (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004, Battersby 2005). If so, this putative subspecies would be Critically Endangered (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005). Surveys show that 30% of populations have declined, whilst only 8% are increasing (Battersby 2005). The Scottish wildcat is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.<br/><strong>Portugal</strong>: The population is suspected to be decreasing (M. Fernandes pers. comm. 2006). Considered Vulnerable at the national level, on the basis of suspected declines reaching 30% over three generations in the past or future (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><strong>Spain</strong>: In some places it is increasing and others decreasing (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Considered Vulnerable at the national level, on the basis of suspected declines of over 30% over the last three generations (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).<br/><strong>Belgium</strong>: Evidence from wild cats found dead on roads indicated that the species is gradually expanding its range to the north and west. There are no data on population size (Libois 2006).<br/><strong>Germany</strong>: The population was recently estimated at 1,700-5,000 individuals (Knapp <em>et al.</em> 2000). The population is increasing and occupying new areas (M. Stubbe pers. comm. 2006). <br/><strong>Slovenia</strong>: The population is estimated (on the basis of density and habitat suitability) at no more than 2,000; it is stable. Recently expanded highways possibly pose some threat in south-east part of its high density range. (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006)<br/><strong>Poland</strong>: Estimated number of wildcats in Poland is between 100 and 150 individuals, estimated density is 1-1.3 per 1000 ha (Okarma <em>et al.</em> 2002). The current distribution of wildcat in the Polish Carpathians, mainly along the borders with Slovakia and Ukraine, shows that the Polish population forms a continuum with Slovak and Ukrainian populations. Together they constitute the northernmost part of the larger Carpathian population of this species. The species is decreasing and is considered endangered (EN) in Red Data Book of Poland (Wolsan <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><strong>Slovakia</strong>: The estimate of the Slovakian population in 2000 was about 1,500 individuals (unpublished data of the Slovak Environmental Agency: A. Olszanska pers. comm. 2006). <br/><strong>Serbia</strong>: There are large populations along the southern Danube (EMA Workshop 2006).<br/><strong>Macedonia</strong>: The species is widespread (EMA Workshop 2006).<br/><strong>Greece</strong>: The wild cat is widespread in continental Greece with sightings in all forested areas and many wetlands. There are apparently more sightings in north and north-east Greece, where the population density seems to be higher. The population trend has not been quantified but is believed to be stable. On Crete it occurs at low densities (G. Giannatos pers. comm. 2006).<br/><strong>Romania</strong>: The population is estimated to number c.10,000 individuals, but this is not based on quantitative data (Red Data Book of Romania). <br/><strong>Bulgaria</strong>: There are no quantitative data, but the species is considered relatively abundant (Spassov <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/>European Russia: The population size and trend have not been quantified, but there are thought to be large, relatively stable populations (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006).<br/><br/>Introduced populations of F. silvestris occur on Crete, Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands, as well as numerous other small Mediterranean islands (Vigne 1992, Hemmer 1999, Gippoliti and Amori 2006). However, the wildcat of Sicily is generally considered to be an autochthonous population of <em>F. s. silvestris</em>, given its genetic distinctness from the mainland Italian population (Randi and Ragni 1991, Gippoliti and Amori 2006).<br/><br/>In Scotland, 88% of wild-living cats may be hybrids or feral domestic cats (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005), and in Italy and Hungary the proportion of hybrids is estimated at 8% and 25-31% respectively (using genetic methods: Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003, Lecis <em>et al.</em> 2006). On the basis of museum specimens, the proportion of hybrids in Bulgaria was estimated at 8-10% (Spassov <em>et al.</em> 1997), but the extent of hybridization may have increased since specimens were collected. Wild cats of mixed origin have also been found in Belgium, Portugal, Germany (only one animal) and Switzerland (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003). In general the genetic distance to the domestic cat is larger in the north of the range than in the south (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003). Eastern European populations are generally considered to be relatively pure (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Outside Europe, the extent of hybridization is considered likely to be lower, but still significant, by Nowell and Jackson (1996), noting reports from Pakistan, central Asia and India.  Evidence of hybridization has been found in southern Africa (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2004, Stuart <em>et al.</em> in press) and North Africa (Stuart <em>et al.</em> in press). Assessing the status of the wildcat is difficult, becuse it is a cryptic species and, moreover, because it may be difficult for some experts to distinguish between specimens of European wildcat and domestic cat (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Morphological critera established by Kitchener <em>et al.</em> (2005) and genetic markers recommended by Driscoll <em>et al.</em> (2007) should help to resolve these problems.",Decreasing,"The wildcat has a very broad distribution, found throughout most of Africa, Europe, and southwest and central Asia into India, China, and Mongolia.  Five subspecies (following Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007) are distributed as follows:<br/><br/>African wildcat <em>F. s. cafra</em>:  Occurs wholly, or in part, in nearly all African countries (Nowell and Jackson 1996). This extremely wide distributional range is accompanied by a very broad habitat tolerance, being apparently only absent from closed tropical forest. Although thinly distributed in true deserts such as the Sahara, they do occur, especially in association with hill and mountain country, such as the Hoggar. In North Africa they occur discontinuously from Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and into Egypt. It has an extensive distribution across the savannas of West Africa from Mauritania on the Atlantic seaboard, eastwards to the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Ethiopia; southwards it is present in all East and southern African countries (Stuart <em>et al.</em> in press).<br/><br/>Near Eastern wildcat <em>F. s. lybica</em>:  Mixes with <em>F. s. cafra</em> in northern Africa, and extends around the periphery of the Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea (Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007)<br/><br/>Asiatic wildcat <em>F. s. ornata</em>:  From the eastern Caspian into western India, and north to Kazakhstan, and into western China and southern Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007)<br/><br/>Chinese alpine steppe cat <em>F. s. bieti</em>:  Previously considered a separate species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Wozencraft 2005), but classified as a wildcat subspecies based on genetic analysis (Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007, Eiziirik <em>et al.</em> 2008).  Based on a small sample size, Garcia-Perea (2000) described cranial characteristics from two skulls as similar to <em>F. silvestris</em>.  Endemic to western China and primarily found in Qinghai province, and possibly also northwestern Sichuan province (He <em>et al.</em> 2002, Wozencraft <em>et al.</em> in press).  He <em>et al.</em> (2004) considered records from other parts of China (Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xingjian, Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia provinces) to be other subspecies of <em>Felis silvestris</em>.  If <em>Felis silvestris bieti</em> is accepted as a subspecies of wildcat, then there may be a gradation in form, and the geographic range may be modified accordingly.<br/><br/>European wildcat <em>F. s. silvestris</em> (IUCN 2007):  In Europe it was formerly very widely distributed and absent only from Fennoscandia. Severe declines and local exirpations occured in Europe between the late 1700s and mid 1900s, resulting in a fragmented relict distribution (Stahl and Artois 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Peichocki 2001). It is extinct in the Netherlands (Nowell and Jackson 1996). It was considered regionally extinct in Austria (Spitzenberger 2005), but vagrants still occur and the Italian population is spreading northwards into Austria (Lapini and Molinari 2006). It is possibly extinct in the Czech Republic (EMA Workshop 2006).  Populations of wildcats occur on Sicily, Crete, Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands, as well as numerous other small Mediterranean islands.  It occurs from sea level to 2,250 m in the Pyrenees (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In some parts of the wildcat's distribution (e.g. Scotland, Stromberg in Germany) it is possible that, as a result of hybridization with the domestic cat, very few genetically pure wildcats remain (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004, Battersby 2005, Herrmann and Vogel 2005).",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II.  Wildcats are fully protected across most of its range in Europe and Asia, but only some of its African range (Nowell and Jackson 1996). It is listed on the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) and the Bern Convention (Appendix II). It is classed as threatened at the national level in many European range states (IUCN 2007). In China, the Chinese mountain cat is protected as a separate species under Category II.  The 1992 meeting of the Cat Specialist Group in Beijing recommended upgrading to Category I, which requires permission of national, rather than provincial, authorities to hunt or trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996), but this has not yet been done.<br/><br/>The main conservation need is to identify populations of genetically pure wildcats and attempt to prevent hybridization by neutering and removing feral domestic cats.  However, such efforts are complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing wildcats from domestic cats, especially when some hybridization has already taken place (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean
13090095,899,Vulpes lagopus,Least Concern,,2007,2006-10-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)<br/>EU 25 regional assessment: Critically Endangered (CR)<br/><br/>At the regional level, the species is Least Concern (there are large populations of >10,000 mature individuals, occupying a large area, and populations are generally stable). However, there may nevertheless be cause for concern in north-western mainland Russia, where population densities apparently are low and have failed to recover despite a decrease in hunting pressure. Little is known about the arctic fox in this region, and more information (and action) is urgently needed.<br/><br/>Within the EU, the arctic fox is found only in Sweden and Finland, where its total population numbers at most 50-70 animals. In Sweden the population is very small but appears to have stabilized, whereas in Finland no breeding has been recorded since 2000 and the population can be assumed to be decreasing. Fennoscandian populations are all tiny and highly fragmented, so no rescue effect should be expected from outside the EU. Consequently the species qualifies as Critically Endangered (D1, C2a(i)).<br/><br/>Arctic foxes in Fennoscandia are isolated from other populations, and thus can be described as a subpopulation (according to global Red List guidelines). Within that subpopulation there are a number of further isolated subpopulations, each numbering less than 50 individuals. The Fennoscandian subpopulation is assessed as Critically Endangered under Criterion C2a(i), as it numbers <250 mature individuals, and there are ongoing declines (although populations in Norway and Sweden are relatively stable, the Finnish population is declining).","The species is confined to arctic and alpine tundra, above or north of the treeline. The arctic fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger, but in most inland areas the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. In Fennoscandia, the Norwegian lemming <em>Lemmus lemmus</em> was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds and reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (Frafjord 1995, Elmhagen <em>et al.</em> 2000). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1995, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1999). The typical response to lemming peak-years is an increase in both the number of litters and litter size (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996).  Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy especially in areas without cyclic rodent populations (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996, Dalerum and Angerbjörn 2000, Eide <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Iceland, lamb carcasses frequently are found among prey remains at dens resulting in the species being considered a pest. Although individual foxes may indeed prey on lambs, it is more likely that a large proportion of the lambs have been scavenged (Hersteinsson 1996). Arctic foxes are known to prey on wildfowl (Eide <em>et al.</em> 2005) and occasionally kill reindeer calves (Prestrud 1992a). <br/><br/>Foxes reach sexual maturity at 10 months, and the average lifespan for animals that reach adulthood is approximately three years (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2004). In more stable coastal environments the average age is probably higher (Prestrud 1992a). Arctic fox life history traits reflect adaptations to differing constraints in resource availability. Arctic foxes in unstable environments (e.g., habitats dominated by cyclic prey) have higher litter size but do not reproduce every year, whereas arctic foxes in stable environments (e.g., coastal habitats with bird cliffs), have a smaller litter size but reproduce every year (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2004). Social organization (home range size and territoriality) and hence local density of arctic fox is also highly influenced by resource availability; home range sizes range from 10 km<sup>2</sup> in stable coastal habitats up to 52 km<sup>2</sup> in more fluctuating environments (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1997, Strand <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eide <em>et al.</em> 2004). Hence predictable coastal habitats support a denser population of foxes compared to more unpredictable habitats. Arctic foxes tend to be territorial, with a mated pair occupying a common territory (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1986, Prestrud 1992b, Landa <em>et al.</em> 1998, Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996, Eide <em>et al.</em> 2004). Additional, but non-reproductive adults may also be present within the territory even though their function as “helpers” may be somewhat limited. In some rare cases it has been observed that two adult females will reproduce within the same territory (Strand <em>et al.</em> 2000, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bodil Elmhagen pers. comm.). As a result of these home range sizes and territorial social organisation typical densities can vary from 20 adults per 100 km<sup>2</sup> to 2-4 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. A noticeable feature of arctic fox ecology is dependence on and year round use of dens. These dens are normally excavated in sandy soil and can reach a considerable size (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Dalerum <em>et al.</em> 2002, Frafjord 2003). After several decades, or even centuries, of use they can acquire many tens of openings. In areas without sandy deposits foxes use crevices in cliffs or moraines as dens (Prestrud 1992b).","Globally the large populations on the continental tundra of Alaska, Canada and Siberia (except Kola) and the island of Greenland are all harvested by trapping or shooting. The main motivation is for fur, although they are killed around settlements in parts of Greenland to reduce the risk of rabies being spread to sled dogs and humans. There is nothing that indicates that these populations are currently threatened by overharvest. The small population on the Komandor islands is threatened by a form of mange (<em>Otodectes cynotis</em>: Goltsman <em>et al.</em> 1996).<br/><br/>In Europe the threats vary between regions.<br/><br/>The animals occupying <strong>western Siberia</strong> are exposed to trapping, but nothing indicates that this is representing an immediate threat. There is no other information available about threats to this population.<br/><br/>On <strong>Svalbard</strong> arctic foxes are trapped, but the extent of this trapping is limited to areas close to settlements, and it is therefore not regarded as a threat (Fuglei <em>et al.</em> 1998). Possible threats include accumulation of long distance transported pollutants and climate change, which may influence sea ice conditions in the future. The arctic fox on Svalbard (Norway) has higher levels of  persistent organic pollutants (POPs)  than foxes in other parts of the arctic (Norheim 1978, Wang-Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1993, Fuglei <em>et al.</em> 2007). The levels are similar to those found in polar bears from Svalbard and Greenland (Verreault <em>et al.</em> 2005). Such high concentrations of contaminants may have possible toxic health effects. The island Bjørnøya holds a small, recently re-established population of arctic foxes, while no foxes have been reported on Jan Mayen since before 1998 (E. Fuglei pers comm. 2007). Arctic foxes on these islands are protected and the main threat appears to be lack of influx of new animals and the extremely small population size. These islands were part of the Svalbard metapopulation, as sea ice allowed connectivity. Climate change through reduction in the extent of the sea ice might in fact explain why the arctic fox has not re-established on Jan Mayen (E. Fuglei pers comm. 2007).<br/><br/><br/>On <strong>Iceland</strong> the status of arctic fox has changed. Historically they were heavily persecuted because of the belief that they were involved in depredation on livestock. Recent legislation has restricted harvest and the population is increasing (Hersteinsson 2006), although in many areas they are still hunted year round.<br/><br/>In <strong>Fennoscandia</strong> arctic foxes are scattered along the peninsula in very small populations that are relatively isolated from each other. The alpine tundra habitat is naturally fragmented, but the degree of population fragmentation has increased due to the extinction of local populations. The populations have not increased despite over 75 years of protection. <br/><br/>Overexploitation due to hunting and trapping was most probably the originate threat and the reason behind the dramatic decline of arctic foxes in Fennoscandia (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Hersteinsson <em>et al.</em> 1989, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1995, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). The value of arctic fox fur together with high grants for killing foxes gave motivation for this strong persecution. In 1924 Norwegian trappers could get 25% more than an average year's salary for a peasant for only one skin (Østbye and Pedersen 1990). Establishment of the fox farm industry at the beginning of 1900 probably also forced the decline further. Live trapping of foxes also continued also after protection. Arctic fox den sites are easy to spot and several dens were dug out during the sixties to catch cubs to bring in to fur farms (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978).     <br/><br/>The exact reason why the population in not responding to protection is not understood, but a range of factors are believed to be involved, including:<br/><br/>Intraguild competition with red foxes. Red fox populations have increased and expanded in range throughout the 20th century, both in the boreal region and above the treeline to alpine tundra habitat (Selås and Vik 2006, Elmhagen <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is known that they have occupied former arctic fox dens in the most productive, low lying areas (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Frafjord 2003, Tannerfeldt <em>et al.</em> 2002, Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). Red foxes occupy the same niche and eat the same prey as arctic foxes (Elmhagen <em>et al.</em> 2002), they can kill arctic fox pups and adults (Frafjord <em>et al.</em> 1989, Tannerfeldt <em>et al.</em> 2002), and arctic foxes avoid breeding close to red foxes (Tannerfeldt <em>et al.</em> 2002). Therefore the potential for a negative effect is clearly present.<br/><br/>Genetics. The remaining arctic fox populations are all very small and relatively isolated from each other. Today the population consists of four genetically distinct subpopulations with very little exchange of dispersing animals (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2002, Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2006). Therefore the potential for inbreeding is high. So far there are no obvious signs of inbreeding depression but individual genetic variation was negatively associated with fitness (Dalén <em>et al.</em> unpublished). Although there is still a surprisingly high degree of variation, by comparison with historical samples it is clear that 25% of the variation has been lost (Nyström <em>et al.</em> 2006). Hybridization with arctic foxes that have escaped from fur farms has also been documented.  Genetic mapping revealed hybridization of genotypes originating from escaped farm foxes (Norén <em>et al.</em> 2005), mixing in haplotypes not found in the wild Fennoscandian arctic fox (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2005). The amount of reported escapes of farm foxes has increased in recent years and even breeding has been observed (N.E. Eide pers. comm. 2006). However at present demographic stochasticity probably remains a greater threat than inbreeding.<br/><br/>Small population size. The small size of populations directly increases their individual risks of extinction, especially when they occupy a fluctuating environment with strong year to year variation in the probability of reproducing (Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Loison <em>et al.</em> 2001). Extinction risk is further increased by fragmentation, which reduces the chance of rescue effects occurring (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Climate change. Projected climate change would intensify fragmentation of the Fennoscandian mountain plateau even further, and may exclude the arctic fox from lower lying alpine tundra areas. For a review of the potential impacts of climate change on arctic foxes see Ims and Fuglei (2005).","The world population of arctic foxes is in the order of several hundred thousand animals (see Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004 for specific details). Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers. The species is common in the tundra areas of Russia, Canada, coastal Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Exceptions are Fennoscandia, Mednyi Island (Komandor Islands, Russia) and the Pribilof Islands, where populations are at critically low levels (Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>The situation in Europe varies between areas. It is most realistic to consider the four geographic areas of occurrence separately:<br/><br/><strong>Western Siberia (from the White Sea to Novaya Zemlya).</strong> There are no reliable data about arctic fox numbers from this region, although Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimate that the total Russian population (including eastern Siberia) could potentially be in the order of 200,000-800,000 animals. In general in Western Russia, the species is sparse on the mainland but common on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, where some thousands of animals can be estimated on the each island (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006). Although the hunting pressure on this species is now very low all over Russia, mainland populations may not have recovered from historical overhunting (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Svalbard.</strong> There has been no total census of arctic foxes on this archipelago, but the population is known to be numerous and stable. The arctic fox went extinct on the island Bjørnøya (part of the Svalbard archipelago) and on Jan Mayen (an isolated island further south between Svalbard and Iceland). The two populations were severely depleted following early 20th century extermination efforts (Fuglei <em>et al.</em> 1998). On  Bjørnøya  the arctic fox population has re-established by immigration over sea ice in recent years, and breeding is again documented, while no foxes have been observed on Jan Mayen since before 1998 (E. Fuglei pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/><strong>Iceland.</strong> Numbers of arctic foxes on Iceland have fluctuated as a result of differing management practices. From a low point in the 1970s of around 1,300 individuals, the population reached 8,000 individuals in 2003 and is still increasing (Hersteinsson 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Fennoscandia.</strong> Arctic foxes were once very abundant throughout the alpine tundra habitats of Fennoscandia, but were greatly reduced due to over-harvesting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They have basically never recovered, despite having been protected for over 75 years (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Hersteinsson <em>et al.</em> 1989, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). The most recent estimate is 120 adults in Norway, Sweden and Finland, around 50 of which are found in Sweden (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005), 50 in Norway (Frafjord and Rofstad 1998, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999), and 5-15 in Finland (Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005). The population on the Kola peninsula has not been accurately censused. Estimates range from c.40 individuals (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005), and less than 100 individuals (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006), to 1,000-2,000 animals (Potansky 1993). The latter figure is considered likely to be an overestimate (Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004). Genetic research showed that the Arctic fox in Scandinavia presently is subdivided into four subpopulations, and that the Kola Peninsula and northwest Russia together form a large fifth subpopulation. Current dispersal between the subpopulations seems to be very low (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2006). The population trend in Norway and Sweden is stable, but in Finland the population can be assumed to be decreasing as there has been no breeding documented since 2000 (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006).",Stable,"Arctic foxes have a circumpolar distribution (Corbet 1978, Hall 1981, Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990, Pulliainen 1999, Wilson and Ruff 1999), occurring in three distinct ecological situations. Arctic foxes are found throughout the area of <strong>continental tundra</strong> that covers the northern coasts of Alaska, Canada and Siberia. They occur on most of the <strong>arctic islands</strong> including all islands of the Canadian high arctic, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Jan Mayen, Bjørnøya, Novaya Zemlja, Wrangel Island, and the Komandor Islands (in addition, they have been introduced to some of the Aleutian Islands: Bailey 1992). Thirdly, they occur on the <strong>alpine tundra</strong> that occurs on the mountain ranges found along the spine of the Scandinavian peninsula (including the Kola region). Arctic foxes are also observed in the open drift ice. In a pan-European context arctic foxes occur in four geographic areas that represent all three ecological situations – continental tundra in western Siberia (Russia), arctic islands in Svalbard (Norway) and Iceland, and alpine tundra in Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola peninsula of Russia). Southern and altitudinal limitations on its global distribution is most probably set by intraguild competition with the larger red fox (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1992). In Europe Arctic foxes occur from sea level to 1,500 m (N.E.

In most of its range, the arctic fox is not protected under national legislation. However, the species and its dens have had total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940.

In Sweden and Finland, a species-specific conservation project has been completed (SEFALO), and a second is under way (SEFALO+), the latter also involving work in Norway (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005). Measures taken include den monitoring (and protection of den sites by excluding ptarmigan hunting in Sweden only), supplementary feeding, red fox control, disease research, as well as building public awareness and education work (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Norway a captive breeding programme on arctic foxes was started in 2000 and extended in 2007. The first successful captive reproduction and release of foxes happened in 2006 (A.

14164772,1794,Aonyx congicus,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-01-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"All Africa's otter species are threatened by alteration or degradation of freshwater habitats and riparian vegetation which are the preferred settlements of human population. Congo Clawless Otters have been protected by the remoteness of the Congo forest and the difficulty of catching them. However, firearms are growing in prevalence in the region, providing a possible 10-fold increase in hunters’ success rate over traditional practices (Levi <em>et al</em>. 2009). Road-building opening up the forest for timber exploitation and construction of large hydroelectric projects could also reduce the protection afforded to date.<br/><br/>Habitat loss by direct causes (clearing, inundation) and indirect causes (pollution, invasive species introduction) and competition for fisheries is increasing with the growing human population in concert with declining returns from an unsustainable bushmeat trade (Wilkie <em>et al</em>. 2005). These combined factors predict a severe reduction of otter habitat and populations. Increased global temperature and resultant climate change may also increase periods of drought, with additional losses to otter populations (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011). Consequently, all African otter species are likely to be more affected in the next 20 years (generation length 6.5 as proposed by Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thus the species isassessed as Near Threatened based on a suspected 25% decline over the next three generations due to the expected decline in habitat quality and other threats to the species. It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A3cde; this is a precautionary listing.","<p>The Congo Clawless Otter occurs in rain forests and lowland swamps of the Congo River basin (Lariviere 2001, Jacques <em>et al.</em> 2009). They are observed in swampy forest clearings (bais), for example, at Langoué Bai in Gabon, and Mbeli Bai in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (N.P.) and in Odzala N.P. in the Republic of the Congo (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009). They also inhabit some rivers, for example Dji Dji River (Gabon) (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011), and Sanaga River (Cameroon) (Jacques 2006). They are recorded up to 2,200 m on the Kahuzi Massif (Rahm and Christiaensen 1963). With one exception (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011), all records report the presence of only one young with the mother (Jacques 2002b).</p>","<em>Aonyx congicus</em> may not be under threat where the forest is still well preserved&#160; (Gabon and parts of Congo). Nevertheless, road opening for wood exploitation could adversely affect the sustainable use of the forest with hunters using these roads for their illegal activities. Deforestation has dramatically increased in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and will probably be an even bigger problem in future. As a result of the high human density, lakes and rivers are subjected to pollutants from human activities such as washing, agricultural run-off and soil erosion.<br/><br/>Overfishing has become a critical threat to otter populations as fish community structure has been decimated across the central Congo Basin. Fishes contribute from 23 to 50 per cent of the animal protein trade in Central Africa (<a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm</a>) and studies of morphometric measurements have documented the evidence of widespread overfishing for human consumption.<br/><br/>In addition to escalation of hunting for bushmeat and skins, habitat loss and degradation, and overfishing, otter populations in Central Africa are also susceptible to pressure from the development of hydro-electric power projects, under-representation of otter habitat in Protected Areas, fishermen using nylon fishing nets, a growing prevalence of arms and munitions, as well as a dramatic decline in other species (such as the Common Hippopotamus) that contribute to the aquatic-ecosystem functioning and which support otter food supplies. Some of these threats are major, but more important is the dramatic combined effect of threats on the otters.<br/><br/>The Congo Clawless Otter seems to average one pup in a litter and may abandon any area of occupancy with high human activity.&#160; In one study on the Dji Dji River in Gabon (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2011), reproductive Congo Clawless Otters disappeared from a site previously observed to harbour high densities of the species (alongside <em>Hydrictis maculicollis</em> which did decline to the same degree). Low rainfall in the previous wet season was thought to be the reason, but nothing is known about the adaptability of otters, their seasonal movements or the whereabouts of Congo Clawless Otters in response to drought conditions. As global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of droughts, these conditions may impact survival and reproduction of the species in the future.<br/><p></p>","<p>This is a very poorly known species. It may be common in certain undisturbed rainforest locations, but is otherwise thought to be rare to very rare (Jacques <em>et al. </em>2009). In certain places, locals attest that they see fewer “big otters” (<em>A. congicus</em> versus <em>H</em><em>. maculicollis</em>) (Jacques 2002b,c; Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2002a; Jacques 2003, 2006; Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011). A number of documented cases of <em>A. congicus</em> (including mother and cub) being killed by locals in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo would suggest that although otters are rarely seen and are difficult to catch, otter populations may suffer from hunting pressure in Congo Basin (Jacques 2002b). This will likely increase in the future as human population grows and preferred bushmeat species become scarce.</p>",Decreasing,"The Congo Clawless Otter occurs in the rainforests of the Congo basin including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as southern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic, northern Angola, and extending eastward to the forests and the wetlands of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Larivière 2001, Jacques <em>et al.</em> 2009). The limits of the species’ distribution range are still unclear, partly due to the species’ possible confusion with the Cape Clawless Otter; there are, as yet, no confirmed records from Nigeria (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Otters are occasionally hunted for meat, but have the reputation of being quite difficult to catch. They are seldom recorded in bushmeat reports (S. Lahm and A.Willox pers. comms., Jacques 2002b). The price is quite similar to other bushmeat. While meat is sought after in Congo and Cameroon, this is not the case in Gabon.<br/><br/>Moreover, in Gabon, otters are sometimes considered dangerous, giving an electrical shock when caught with a spear. In Central and West Africa, their meat has the reputation of being an aphrodisiac (as it is with many other species). In some areas, the otter is said to possess magical powers: by wearing a piece of fur one can become invisible to an opponent, or escape an enemy as otters escape fish traps.<br/><br/>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), killing has exponentially increased over the recent decade with the proliferation of weapons and munitions, making the shooting of otters from pirogues and the river bank much more common (Thompson pers. comm.). Skins of <em>A. congicus </em>are used in Cameroon to make drums (Alary <em>et al</em>. 2001). According to Carpaneto and Germi (1989), Mbuti pygmies in northeastern DRC use the skins of Congo Clawless Otters to make hats.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Congo Clawless Otter is present in several protected areas across their range, including Dzanga-Sangha N.P. in Central African Republic, Ivindo Gabon, and Nouabalé-Ndoki and Odzala National Parks in Congo Republic (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009). Thus they are incidentally conserved with other target species..It is listed on CITES Appendix II (as <em>Aonyx capensis</em>). Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled. There is a need for a detailed study on the biology, ecology, and distribution of this species.<br/><br/>In addition to threats already cited, Congo Clawless Otters likely to suffer from a general lack of awareness of their presence and conservation needs by the institutions in charge of wildlife conservation in most African countries. The initiative of the Wildlife Conservation Society to include otters in their document ‘Setting conservation and research priorities for larger African carnivores’ (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005) could aid in greater awareness and promotion of more research on African otters. Otters could be used as symbols of water quality and preservation, and this may contribute to environmental education. The Congo Clawless Otter should be totally protected in Gabon, Congo, DRC and Cameroon until more information is collected about its status.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Major threats to Geladas include the conversion of their habitat into farmland, grazing land and human settlements, as well as the climate change impacts (Dunbar 1998, Beehner <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, in the absence of more detailed data regarding current geographic range and demographic trends, the species remains listed as Least Concern.</p>  <a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Geladas are associated with Afroalpine grasslands and adjacent rocky gorges and precipices (Bergman and Beehner 2013). This species feeds mainly on the flat margins of high grass plateaus, known locally as high Wurch or Puna grassland steppe, with <em>Agrostis</em> and <em>Festuca</em> grasses and giant <em>Lobelia</em> groves. Gelada bands consist of 30–289 animals, subdivided into 5–26 one-male units (Bergman and Beehner 2013, Abu <em>et al. </em>2018). Bands keep within 2 km of the escarpment edges, where they retreat at night to sleep or if alarmed (Fashing &amp; Nguyen 2016). Typical annual home-range size for Geladas is 9–12&#160;km²&#160;(Hunter 2001, Moua 2015). Geladas are poor tree-climbers and are almost entirely terrestrial, partly a consequence of their unusual dietary specialization as a grazer (Dunbar 1983).<br/><br/>Geladas feed primarily on the leaves of graminoids (grasses and sedges) and also forbs (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). They also excavate and consume subterranean foods including roots, corms, tubers and rhizomes (Fashing <em>et al</em>. 2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey<em> et al.</em> 2018), especially during the dry season when green vegetation is less abundant (Fashing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). Invertebrates are eaten opportunistically (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2010, 2014), and cereal crops may be taken where agriculture encroaches onto the Geladas' habitat (Abu <em>et al. </em>2018, Jarvey <em>et al</em>. 2018).","<p>The overall range of the Gelada is being eroded by agricultural expansion resulting from rapid human population growth in the Ethiopian highlands. Conversion of Gelada habitat to farmland and livestock grazing is common (Bergman and Beehner 2013) and soil erosion is a serious problem throughout the region (Nyssen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grazing pressure is intense, and competition from domestic livestock has forced the Gelada to remain on the less productive gorge slopes in some areas (e. g. eastern Arsi) (Abu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gelada densities are considerably lower in heavily populated areas than in undisturbed habitats (R. Burke, pers. obs.).</p>  <p>Geladas are also harassed, shot or hunted with dogs as crop pests (R. Burke, pers. obs.) and occasionally sold locally as pets (Bergman and Beehner 2013). In the past, Geladas were trapped for zoos though this practice no longer occurs. Also, in the past, adult male numbers were reduced as a result of selective shooting for their capes of hair, which were made into ceremonial costumes used by the Oromo people (Dunbar 1977). The extent of this practice today is unknown. There are also historic records of Gelada capes being made into fur hats for tourists (Dunbar 1977).</p>  <p>Government-sanctioned trophy hunting of Geladas by tourists is currently allowed in controlled hunting areas, although the extent and impact of this practice are unknown.</p>  <p>Parasitic swellings caused by tapeworms (<em>Taenia serialis</em>) are a major cause of death in some Gelada populations (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2015, Schneider-Crease <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>Climate change poses a long-term threat to Geladas, especially for populations inhabiting higher elevations, where agriculture has previously been impossible or uncommon (Dunbar 1998).</p>","<p>Geladas are widespread throughout much of their present range, although they are probably not as abundant as they were in the 1970s, when an aerial survey of the central Ethiopian Highlands yielded a population estimate of 440,000 individuals (Dunbar 1977). A concurrent alternative estimate based on known ground densities from a small proportion of the Gelada’s geographic range and the total area of gorge face on the plateau yielded a figure of 884,000 (Dunbar 1977). Detailed ground surveys at five sites yielded overall densities varying between 15 and 69 animals/km², although densities of animals within their home ranges typically reached 70–80/km² (Dunbar 1977). A recent estimate for what is believed to be the largest remaining population of Geladas, in and around Simien Mountains National Park, was ~4,300 individuals, down from ~10,000 individuals in the 1970s (Beehner <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bergman and Beehner 2013).</p><p>While recent habitat conversion to farming and grazing lands has undoubtedly adversely affected the Afroalpine grassland habitats of Geladas (Fashing and Nguyen 2016), only further comprehensive surveys will reveal the extent to which Gelada populations across the highlands have changed since the 1970s.</p>",Decreasing,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Theropithecus gelada</em>&#160;is restricted to Afroalpine grasslands adjacent to deep gorges and cliffs in the Provinces of Tigray, Begemdir (Gondar), Wollo, Shoa and Arsi at altitudes between 1,800 and 4,400 m asl (Jablonski 2005, Gippoliti 2010).

A population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (39 years) is estimated, including a period of four years in the past and projected forwards for the next 35 years, due mainly to a decline in habitat quality as well as unsustainable levels of exploitation. The total population size was estimated between 260 and 330 individuals, which, according to new data from China (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012; Guangsong <em>et al.</em> 2014), is probably an underestimate. Based on the interviews with hunters (Momberg <em>et al. </em>2010), at least 13 Burmese Snub-nosed Monkeys were hunted during 2009. It is predicted that hunting pressure on the Myanmar side (directed and undirected) is likely to increase considerably in the next few years as new dam construction and logging roads invade the distribution area of this species.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">The distribution area is mountainous, and slopes are very steep in most places.

There is no information how high up the mountains the monkeys go, but the highest mountain in this range is 3,660 m. According to local hunters, Snub-nosed Monkeys spend the summer (i.e., the snow-free times from May to October) mostly at higher altitudes, in mixed temperate forests and conifer forests. In winter, however, when snowfall probably restricts the availability of food, the monkeys descend to lower elevations and may be found closer to villages.</p><p><span lang=""EN-IN"">Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>.

Animals are hunted and trapped for their bones and heads, but most often monkeys are unintentionally trapped in iron traps that are set to trap deer or wild pigs to supply the local bush meat trade (this has been confirmed by local hunters and there is camera trap evidence of the monkeys travelling on the ground where traps have been set) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Already with the still limited construction work camps, commercial bush meat demand  has increased sharply over the last two years (2010-2011) and is set to accelerate (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Monkeys may also be caught in traps set for bears (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation, due to the creation of roads and other infrastructure is rapidly becoming a major threat. Logging roads have now been built into all the areas occupied by this species since 2009 (some are within 200 m of the camera traps) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). With the increased access, the influx of Chinese workers to the area as part of the logging and dam building operations is accelerating and it is expected that when the dams reach the full construction stage there will be at least 10,000 workers employed in this area (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat loss due the impacts of logging is very serious due to large scale mechanical logging (blasting of logging roads, use of heavy equipment and winches, reaching ridges and even peaks) taking place, especially as the largest part of the range area is conifer forest and during the snow-covered winter months the Snub-nosed Monkeys (just as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">R. bieti</span>) depend on lichens for food (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). As the logging is effecting most mature conifer trees, food sources especially in winter are becoming scarce. The logging practices are causing serious destruction because logging takes place at high altitudes and even on slopes with more than 70 degrees slope inclination (these areas are accessed using winches and roads are blasted through cliffs). Land slides are becoming increasingly common as a result of the loss of tree cover. The&#160; lower mountain broad leaf forest is also impacted by logging (targeting hardwoods) and landslides caused by logging roads. Shifting cultivation reaches from the N'mai Hka river valley up to 2,000 meters, flooding following dam construction will displace shifting cultivation areas in the valley bottom to higher areas, increasing the pressures on the Snub-nosed Monkey habitat (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">At present, the conservation status of the monkey in China remains unclear.

It occupies a wide range of forest types including low, mid-montane and montane moist forest, ground water forest, secondary forest, riverine forest, swamp forest and gallery forest. It is often common in secondary or degraded forest (Fashing and Oates 2013, Groves and Ting 2013). <em>Colobus guereza</em> is strictly folivorous in some regions, but feeds both on leaves and fruits in others (Fashing and Oates 2013). They live in groups of 2-10 adults, and group home ranges are from 1.5 to 100 ha (Fashing and Oates 2013, Groves and Ting 2013).","<em>Colobus guereza</em> is one of the few primate species which responds well to low to medium levels of habitat disturbance.

These declines are significant, but probably are not yet enough to qualify for listing as Vulnerable (i.e., 30% over three generations or 36 years). If the threats continue or increase in the future, the species will have to be reassessed and it may then move into a threatened category.</p>","<p>This species is diurnal and omnivorous, and at times both arboreal and terrestrial. It prefers dense forest (Choudhury 2001), and does not usually occur in secondary forest. It is found in tropical and subtropical semi­evergreen forests, dry deciduous and montane Forest (Srivistava and Mohnot 2001, R. Boonratana pers. comm.). Particular habitats and niches vary some depending on the subspecies. This species is found from the floodplains to the high mountains, up to 2,800 m, and sometimes 3,000 m in the summer (Choudhury 2001), and perhaps up to 4,000 m (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001, Zhang <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2002). It is generally an upland species, and usually associated with hill areas above 1,000 m. In the wetter east the species may also frequent areas that do not or only marginally reach 1,000m and may occur even in the lowlands. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is predominantly associated with high altitudes, usually above 500 m. In forests on limestone karst the species occurs in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). Six sites at 200-400 m asl range in Karst habitats were reported from Lao PDR: Houay Phasong, Nam Ngo, and 4 sites in Muang Vilabouli (Timmins and Duckworth 2013)</p>  <p>The generation of this species is 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003). There is a wide preference of vegetation across the macaque distribution. From subtropical mid-elevation montane broadleaf rainforests and temperate evergreen forests of higher elevations. In Thailand, they occupy mixed deciduous/bamboo dry evergreen forest from lowland to mountainous areas. Rocky crags and karsts are also preferred sleeping sites. They are also found close to human settlements where they are provisioned and in many areas like Kanchanaburi Province (14°41’N), Thailand they have resorted to begging. </p>  <p>There is a gradual change in preference for food in certain areas of their distribution such as in Darjeeling, West Bengal of which eleven of their 63 preferred plant species are cultigens. Generally, their natural diet includes fruits such as banana, mango, papaya, apple, litchi, cucumber, papaya, orange, bamboo shoots, and leaves. They are also used to feeding of human hands and prefer food such as bread, other varieties of cooked snacks, molasses. </p>  <p>In Assam the species raid the vegetable gardens, crop land and villages near to their habitats (Chetry and Das pers. comm.).</p>  <p>Dietary studies in Nonggang, China, conducted between 2005 and 2006 suggest folivorous inclination: 77.4% of all feeding records were of leaves and 17.4% of total feeding records were of fruits. Young leaves formed the ‘bulk’ of the diet with their consumption ration varying from 44.9% in July to 92.9% in May. <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>, a type of bamboo and its unexpanded leaves formed the bulk of the young leaf diet (Zhou <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2011)</p>  <p>Follow-up studies conducted in Nonggang between 2012 and 2013 corroborate the finding. While leaves were dominant in the diet (75.5%), the leaves of&#160; <em>Bonia</em><em> </em><em>saxatilis</em> bamboo were more preferred as opposed to <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>. Seventy-eight food species were reported to be consumed by the macaques in the region (Huang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) </p>  <p>Modest swelling of sexual skin during breeding. Gestation of 5.5 months and single young born every two years. There is seasonal migration to higher altitudes in summer and to lower altitudes in winter. Multimale-multifemale type social organization. Schulke <em>et al.</em> (2010) derived the relationship between social bonds and reproductive success in wild macaques in Thailand. Tight social bonds in male macaques was seen to promote good ‘coalition’ which in turn translated into social dominance and reproductive success. Female Assamese macaques tend to exhibit ‘non-random’ and ‘promiscuous’ mating across male ranks and mate more frequently with certain males while exhibiting ‘concealed’ fertility. This tactic could in fact protect infants during intra-troop change in male dominance and as suggested in the literature, to main special and particular bonds in a rather open and ‘promiscuous’ environment (Furtbauer <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2014)</p>  <p>Average group size of 20 individuals. Group size in Nonggang 15-17 individuals. Single males outside group have been spotted.</p>  <p>Home range of 53-65 ha and mean daily path length of 590-782 m as studied in Nonggang Food distribution seems to influence the macaques distribution wherein most of their time was seen to be spent on cliffs (71.7% of total location records) and hillsides (20.2%). The cliffs and hill tops are often inundated with <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calcicolus</em>, the primary preferred leaf source of macaques (Zhou <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;2014).</p>  <p>Parasite prevalence rate in Assamese macaques in Shivpuri Nagarjuna National Park was 72.94%. Protozoan and helminth parasites were found during faecal studies in the macaques suggesting such parasites as conservation threats to the species (Pokhrel and Maharajan 2014). </p>","The threats to this species' habitat include selective logging and various forms of anthropogenic development and activities, alien invasive species, and hunting and trapping for sport,“medicine,” food, and the pet trade. Additionally, hybridization with adjacent species poses a threat to some populations (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although it has a wide distribution, the species is considered to be threatened in most parts of its range. Habitat destruction is the primary cause of the decline. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses the greatest risk to this species in northeastern India (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). However, it has been hunted in the Himalayan regions of North Bengal, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it frequently invades crops (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). Locals use skulls as an “evil eye” in front of houses in northeastern India (Das pers. comm.). There has been extensive habitat loss over the last 15 years in several states of northeastern India (from 30 to 60%), with major impacts on <em>M. a. assamensis</em>. <br/><br/>The Nepal population of <em>Macaca assamensis </em>is threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 2,200 km² extent of occurrence and 914 km area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, the number of locations and in the number of mature individuals the latter two conditions being inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively. Given its restricted extent of occurrence, threats on its population and habitat, and small numbers in fragmented patches, the Nepal population of this macaque is categorized as Endangered.<br/><br/>In Thailand habitat loss is the primary threat, hunting for food less so (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). It is protected only in temples.<br/><br/>In eastern Myanmar habitat loss is the primary threat, but hunting is presumed to occur. They are hunted to make footwear, and the skins are taken to Tibet as it is more profitable than taking it to Yunnan province of China. In northern Myanmar, hunting and habitat loss due to conversion are the major threats. There is more than 30% decline in forest cover over the last 30-­35 years. The combination of habitat loss and hunting heavily impacts the subpopulations, and the threats are likely to continue in the next three decades if the demand for this continues in Tibet (S. Htun pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the primary threat is hunting for food and for bones to make balm and/or glue. The bones are not used within Lao PDR, but sold to Viet Namese and traders within Lao PDR. The balm is used for pain relief and other speculative “medicinal” purposes. The trade also goes into China (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). This species has declined in VietNam and Lao PDR in the last 30-35 years by more than 30%, and is expected to continue to decline in the future.<br/><br/>In Tibet the habitat is good, but there is some hunting, and no detailed data exists for <em>M. a. pelops</em> from that region of China (Z. Zhou et al. pers. comm.). For <em>M. a. assamensis</em>, Hunting is a major threat. Logging has ceased, but was a major threat for the last 30 years. Conversion to pastures is still ongoing, but not a significant threat There are extensive habitats still left for this subspecies and the taxon is relatively safe. <br/><br/>Habitat reduction and degradation, agricultural activities, mining, rapid developmental activities in certain areas of the macaque’s distribution, hunting for food, traditional medicine, selective logging, loss of fruiting trees and human encroachment into critical macaque habitat, gold mining and shifting cultivation in Viet Nam, limestone mining destroying the macaques preferred habitats. Poaching for food and hunting for sale, political unrest in Myanmar are some existing serious threats.","There is little information available on the global population. Although it is thought to be relatively high, there is decline in the wild populations in certain countries, but not throughout the distribution. It is probably the most common macaque species in Lao PDR, where it is widespread through hill and mountain forest ranges, though no population estimate is available (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, R. Timmins pers. comm). In Nepal the taxon is also restricted to less than 300 mature individuals, distributed in eight subpopulations, with no subpopulation having more than 50 mature individuals. There is no information on population estimates from Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm). In northern Myanmar it is a very common species, but information from the eastern part of the country is not available (S. Htun pers. comm). <br/><br/>Due to hunting pressure, macaques in Viet Nam are scarce. However, there is no precise information for this species on population and status (R. Timmins pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. assamensis </em>is relatively widespread in its extent of occurrence (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India, the population was found to have a group density of 1.11/km and an average group size of 13.93 individuals (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). This species is the most abundant monkey in the mountains of Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2001). In China 8,200 individuals is reported in 2009 (Long and Jiang pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. pelops</em> is only found in adjacent populations in India, Bhutan, and adjacent China. There are likely fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2002). A subpopulation of <em>M. assamensis </em>is endemic to Nepal and relegated to a single population there, and is considered as a possible new subspecies (M. Chalise pers. comm.). However, further taxonomic clarification is needed.<br/><br/>No new population estimate in any of the macaque’s distribution. The macaques though have seen remarkable decline in population over the years and still under threat (refer to threats section) from numerous unsustainable activities.<br/><br/>In China, in the 1950s and 1960s the macaques are believed to be quite numerous and very much common in south-eastern Yunnan and in Gunagxi until they became really rare due to the threat of hunting and trapping for traditional medicine.",Decreasing,"<em>Macaca assamensis</em> occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, southwestern China (Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet and Yunnan), northwestern India (Uttarakhand), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and West Bengal), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, northwestern Thailand, and northern Viet Nam. It is found from western Nepal east into northern Myanmar and southeast through southernmost China to the upper Mekong in Tibet, and in the east into southern Guizhou to Hoi Xuan in Viet Nam and Thateng in Lao PDR; the range continues south through the Myanmar/Thailand border ranges as far as Chongkrong, as well as to the Sunderbans in Bangladesh. <br/><br/>There is a gap in northeastern India between the two main population pockets, specifically between central Bhutan and the south side of the Brahmaputra; the east bank of its upper course, the Dibang, marks the division between the two subspecies (Groves 2001). More recent studies indicate no gap in the population as the species is found throughout Arunachal Pradesh state, and the Sunderban population requires careful consideration given that only two individuals have been seen in over 140 years with no recent updates on the social media or anywhere on the distribution of the species (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/><em>Macaca a. assamensis</em> occurs in South and South-east Asia, from 200 to 2,750 m asl, east of Brahmaputra, southwestern China (Southeastern Xizang Autonomous Region Tibet, west and south of Yunnan, south Guizhou, southwestern Guanxi provinces), northeastern India (Eastern Arunachal Pradesh, eastern Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura states, south and east through northern, eastern and western Myanmar, northern and western Thailand, Laos and northern Viet Nam.<br/><br/><em>Macaca a. pelops</em> occurs up to 3,100 m in the Himalaya from central Nepal (western limit being Tipling 83°36’ E) through to northeastern India (northern West Bengal, Sikkim, western Assam states, and Bhutan (eastern limit Manas River, 90°58’E) widely ‘disjunct’ and ‘geographic relict’ in Sunderbans, southwestern Bangladesh.","It is hunted for food, 'medicine' and for fashion apparel.",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed in Appendix II of CITES (Chetry <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003).

However, Guanaco actual conservation measures continue to be primarily based upon recurring emergencies, <span lang=""EN-GB"">specifically<span lang=""EN-US"">, severe local poaching, which do not fulfill the greater holistic threats faced by the species.&#160; This is a result of its wide distribution existing in small-fragmented and isolated populations, in contrast to some abundant populations that are locally and widely distributed.<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/>Of grave concern <span lang=""EN-GB"">at the national level is that Guanacos are likely to become extinct in three out of the five countries where they were historically found and currently classified as Endangered: Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru.&#160; For this reason it is important to emphasize that future Guanaco management not only address the poaching problem, but also focus upon the implementation of measures orientated to the protection and conservation of those depressed populations, as well as, simultaneously expand the sustained utilization of those recovered and abundant populations for benefit of local residents and landowners. Accordingly, a more accurate classification of Guanaco, such as a Regional Assessment is needed in order to reflect the actual heterogeneity of populations across its multi-country distribution.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation due to overgrazing, competition with introduced herbivores, and habitat degradation due to extractive industries are the main threats to Guanaco (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Nevertheless, persistent illegal hunting is one of the historical threats to the species, independent of population size that is strongly impacting small and low-density populations <span lang=""EN-US"">(González 2010a,&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Wildlife Conservation Society 2012<span lang=""EN-US"">).&#160; Equally important is the continued hunting of numerically recovered populations (Lambertucci and Speziale 2011) based upon antagonism towards the species by livestock and landowners who have put pressure on governments to control Guanaco numbers.&#160; Examples of this situation occur in the Patagonia of Chile and Argentina, and populations in the Andes of Central Chile.<br/><br/>Human activities such as hunting, mining, oil exploration and extraction, livestock fencing, development of infrastructure, and habitat loss, often impose barriers to migration and movement between populations. The loss of connectivity has resulted in small, closed and isolated populations under increasing risk of collapse due to the loss of genetic variation and environmental or demographic stochasticity – the latter being highly relevant to inordinately small populations.&#160; Recent research, however, on a small island population of Guanacos indicates that such isolation may not be the problem of genetic-diversity loss in the short-term (70 years) as previously envisioned, yet long-term consequences are inevitable (<span lang=""EN-US"">González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/>Live-shearing of captured Guanacos is currently under development in Patagonia with Argentine-government funding. &#160;If properly managed, these programmes can offer an alternative to local economies and re-evaluation of negative attitudes by landowners towards the species (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, Lichtenstein and Carmanchahi 2012, Lichtenstein 2013). More than 11,000 Guanacos had been shorn between 2004-<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB"">2008, yet today only a very small percentage of the total Guanaco population is under such management (Lichtenstein 2013). The effects of sustained-fibre utilization are being assessed and monitored, especially where Guanacos are concentrated in scattered high-density populations (Ovejero <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Carmanchahi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). To encourage the marketing of Guanaco products, Argentina is developing and promoting Guanaco yarn and thread.<br/><br/>Guanacos have been legally hunted in Chile since 2003, with pressure for similar management in the Argentinean Patagonia in order to reduce density and conflicts with livestock production and forestry. However, a recent study revealed that hunting adult Guanacos by itself does not reduce browsing damage to <em>Nothofagus</em> regeneration in Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Martinez-Pastur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Still, government sanctioned and organized harvesting of Guanacos has resulted in the exportation of meat, contributed to the value of the species, and begun to reduce traditional conflict with sheep ranchers and foresters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a wild ungulate found from sea level to over 5,000 meters elevation (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, González in prep.). At the continental and country levels, climate has mainly driven distributional range of the species (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2013). Guanaco habitat is characterized by highly seasonal climates, dry winters or snow covered, cold temperatures including below zero, winds from moderate to high intensity and low precipitation combined with high evapotranspiration create arid conditions that in general result in low plant productivity (Franklin, 1982, 1983; Wheeler 1995).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In the sub-region of Patagonia (Hershkovitz 1972) Guanacos inhabit four of the ten major environments described for South America (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2006): 1) Desert and Xeric Shrublands, 2) Montane Grasslands, 3) Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and 4) Temperate Forests (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Phytogeographically, Guanacos inhabit the provinces of the Monte and Patagonia, arid and semi-arid shrublands, and grasslands comprising around 1,000,000 km² (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). On a smaller scale, the presence or absence of this species can be explained by altitude, vegetation, topography, and the occurrence of livestock (Travaini <em>et al. </em>2007, Acebes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Iranzo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, González <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/></span><br/>Both migratory and sedentary populations exist across the Guanaco range. Migration is mainly driven by winter forage supply and snow depth as observed for Andean and some Patagonian population before and after the reproductive season (Ortega and Franklin 1995). A minimal annual home range reported for the species is 2-9 km<sup>2 </sup>in sedentary animals (Marino and Baldi 2008), whereas in migratory populations they can reach up to 900 km<sup>2</sup> in the Andes (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008) and around 40 km<sup>2</sup> in Tierra del Fuego during winter (Moraga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The Guanaco’s primary natural predator is the Puma (<em>Puma concolor</em>; Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999) and secondarily the Andean Fox (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>; Novaro <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160; Its distribution overlaps marginally with other native ungulates such as Huemul (<em>Hippocamelus bisulcus</em>) in Patagonia, Taruka (<em>Hippocamelus anticensis</em>) in mountains of the central Andes, and the Vicuña (<em>Vicugna vicugna</em>) in some parts of the altiplano (Luccherini 1996, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Rundel and Palma 2000).<br/><br/>Adult Guanacos weigh 80-120 kg (Wheeler 1995, González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) and their breeding system is based upon resource defence polygyny, i.e. an adult male defends a territory where birthing and mating occur and a group of females and their offspring (chulengos) feed freely from the intrusion of other males (Franklin 1982, 1983). The Family Group is the basic social unit that occupies a Feeding Territory defended by the resident adult male. Other units found during the reproductive season, include Solo Males that defends a territory without females, and non-territorial Male Groups composed of males of various ages (Franklin 2011). In migratory populations outside the reproductive season, large Mixed Groups can be observed composed of both sexes of all ages (Ortega and Franklin 1995).<br/><br/>Vigilance and foraging accounted for almost 90% of the diurnal time budget for male and female Guanacos in Family Groups, where animals benefited from living in groups as individual foraging time increased with group size, as well as, collective vigilance against predators (Marino and Baldi 2008). Territoriality apparently limits population density, reaching lower K (equilibrium density) when contrasted with models based on individual forage intake (Marino <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Empirical field data has also shown that Family Group size is positively correlated with forage production within Feeding Territories (Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;in press).&#160;<br/><br/>Guanacos are generalist herbivores of intermediate selectivity, i.e. their diets include large proportions of both grasses and shrubs (Raedeke and Simmoneti 1988; Fraser 1998; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, 2011, 2014; Baldi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Domestic sheep was the main ungulate introduced across the Guanaco’s range, reaching 22 million within 50 years after its introduction in the Argentine Patagonia in the late 1800s. Guanacos and sheep largely overlap in their forage preferences as much as 80% in some areas (Puig<em> et al.&#160;</em>2001). Although both species can include some 100 plant species in their diets, only 17 species make up 80% of the diets, and in Patagonia two grass species represent 40% for both Guanaco and sheep diets (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Other introduced ungulates found in Guanaco habitat are goats, cattle, donkeys, and horses, but few studies have assessed their diet overlap with the Guanaco. A preliminary study in the Bolivian Chaco showed that the Guanaco is a generalist feeder, responding to the seasonal availability of fruits, flowers and leaves, including a variety of cacti (Cuéllar, unpublished data). In that same region Guanacos mainly compete for forage and spatial resources with cattle and horses.<br/><br/>Competition with livestock, hunting, and habitat modification has often resulted in Guanacos occupying marginal, low quality lands in terms of vegetation cover and the availability of preferred plant species caused by sheep monopolizing the most productive areas (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Iranzo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). A spatial segregation has been found in northern Chile between Guanacos and Donkeys <em>Equus asinus</em> (Malo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Guanacos are still numerous and widely distributed but continue their decline initiated in the 19th century in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and major parts of Chile. Over-hunting, range degradation from livestock overgrazing, and interspecific competition for forage have all played significant and long-time roles in the demise of Guanacos all across their distributional range (Raedeke 1979; Franklin 1982; Miller<em> et al. </em>1983; Cunazza <em>et al. </em>1995; Cuellar and Fuentes 2000; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, 2004). Currently, the main threats are still widespread, but mining and energy projects are also becoming a factor. Of special concern is the recent and rapid development of unconventional oil and gas exploration across large areas of the Guanaco’s distribution.<br/><br/>In Peru Guanacos are seriously affected by poaching and subsistence hunting. Habitat degradation due to extractive industries and livestock overgrazing has been identified as major threats for the few remaining subpopulations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).<br/><br/>In Bolivia the current major threat is habitat loss due to overgrazing by livestock. Although sport hunting was halted in 2001 (Cuéllar, unpublished data), poaching is still common.<br/><br/>In Chile and Argentina, recreational hunting and poaching are major threats. In northern Chile at the local level, feral dogs are reducing Guanaco populations within and outside protected areas, and hybridism with Llamas is common in areas with low Guanaco densities. Mining and oil extraction along with photovoltaic and wind parks have expanded with the demand for increased production, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation of populations in both countries.&#160; In addition, in northern Chile and the Argentine Patagonia infrastructure development has caused road kills and entrapment within barriers lining highways causing local isolation and limiting population movements <span lang=""EN-US"">(Rey<em> et al.</em><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;2012). Finally, in Chile and Argentina where numbers have recovered due to government sponsored management programs and Guanaco populations coexist with ranching and forestry practices, there has been a return to public resentment towards Guanacos as occurred in historical times. Demonstrated-sustained programs of Guanacos utilization that benefit the local economy and lower population numbers are needed if Guanaco are to be maintained.<br/></span></span><br/>Health studies conducted in mainland Patagonia have shown that Guanaco populations are relatively disease-free, but susceptible to common diseases from domestic sheep, cattle, and horses (Karesh <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Beldomenico<em> et al.</em> 2003, Uhart <em>et al.</em> unpub. data). Castillo (2006) came to a similar conclusion based upon studies of parasite load in free ranging Peruvian Guanacos. Recently, scabies has been reported to affect Guanacos in northern Chile causing mortality in low-density populations. It is also a common disease in Guanacos inhabiting Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Skewes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Today the Guanaco occupies only 26% of its original range (calculated by Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Specifically, range distribution has been reduced by 58% in Argentina, 75% in Chile, and over 90% in Perú, Bolivia, and Paraguay (<span lang=""EN-US"">Cunazza <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Moreover, distribution has become fragmented into smaller, relatively isolated populations. Although the species is not threatened with demographic extinction at a continental scale, it is predicted that the northern subspecies <em>L. guanicoe cacsilensis</em> will become extinct in Peru within 30 years if current-hunting mortality rates are not curtailed (<a href=""www.conopa.org"">www.conopa.org</a>). Guanacos are ecologically extinct in most of their remaining range (Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2000), with some southern populations at serious risk of local or even regional extirpation (Cunazza <em>et al.&#160;</em>1995). Spatial fragmentation in general is a threat to Guanaco populations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Recent findings suggest that inbreeding or aberrant mutations may lead to reproductive failure and congenital malformations (Franklin and Grigione 2005, Zapata <em>et al. </em>2008, González <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/></span><br/>Increasing pressure from private landowners in Patagonian rangelands may result in a threat to the remaining high-density Guanaco populations if management is not properly planned and implemented. Live-shearing and subsequent release of wild Guanacos could contribute to their conservation only if the effects of this activity are properly assessed and management is applied accordingly. If not ecologically sustainable, the viability of the most important Guanaco populations will be at risk. Careful evaluation of current management practices involving live shearing is currently in progress, but a long-term assessment is necessary. For Guanaco populations under a hunting strategy of use, information about habitat preferences, flight distance, individual and population movement, group composition, and the effect on neighbouring populations are urgently needed for proper assessment of this kind of productive system.<br/><br/>Land desertification due to overgrazing coupled with more severe and frequent droughts caused by climate change/variation are potential threats of great concern to Guanaco abundance throughout its range. Severe droughts can have drastic effects on local Guanaco populations as documented in eastern Patagonia (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In addition, models on climate change predict a sharp decrease in rain precipitation within the next 50 years in arid-southern South America (Nohara <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Therefore, it is crucial to favor the ecological functionality of Guanaco populations through adequate management as a step to mitigate additional effects of climate change.&#160;</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">It is estimated that Guanaco abundance has been reduced to only 3-7% of their original numbers when Europeans arrived to South America and the total Guanaco population was between 30-50 million animals (Raedeke 1979). Today, the total continental population of Guanacos is between 1,500,000-2,200,000 with the estimated number of adults between 1,000,000-1,500,000 (calculated from life-tables of Raedeke 1979; Fritz and Franklin 1994), two to three times greater than previously assessed (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">That number would be reduced if effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) is applied (Sarno <em>et al. </em>2015). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Some 81-86% of the Guanaco population is found in Argentina followed by Chile at 14-18%. The total numbers in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay are less than 1% of the total. Differences in survey methodologies and effort across such a vast area make it necessary to be cautious about population numbers and should be taken only as references. Specifically, what is needed is a more reliable estimate for the entire Argentine Patagonia (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For Chile the total estimate is rather speculative as these numbers come from scattered information instead of planned surveys.&#160; More accurate surveys will hopefully come from new methods applicable for population estimation designed for large areas (González 2010a) or application of standard methodologies at broad scale (Soto 2010). For Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay, most assessments have been based mainly on animal counts because of the large and remote areas involved, possibly underestimating total population size.<br/></span></span><br/>Although Guanaco distribution in the Argentine Patagonia is rather continuous, densities are typically low (&lt;5 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>) and even very low in many parts of Chubut, Rio Negro and Neuquén Provinces (&lt;2 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>). High-density populations are actually scarce in the Patagonia of Argentina (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, 2010; Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2007; Puig <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, 2003). A recent estimate for Patagonia was reported by Gavuzzo <em>et al.</em> (2015) applying aerial censuses techniques, but the numbers must be used for reference because of problematic assumptions, and used with caution if management decisions are at the local level (Schiavini and Rey 2015). Nevertheless, aerial surveys can agree with population estimation by modelling, for example those from the Santa Cruz Province (Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For the rest of Argentina, population densities are below one Guanaco/km² and highly fragmented (Baigún <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Puig and Videla 2007) with some relict populations in La Pampa, Córdoba and Buenos Aires Provinces (Sosa and Sarasola 2005, Barri and Cufré 2014). Some high-density populations occur in southern Chile reaching up to 43 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at Torres del Paine National Park (Sarno and Franklin 1999), but in the rest of Chile populations are small and widely scattered.<br/><br/>As a general rule, it is recommended to use the distance sampling methods either for ground or aerial surveys for open and flat environments, as they are based upon more realistic assumptions than total counts or fixed-width strip transect methods that tend to underestimate population numbers (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, where numbers are very low as in relict populations, total counts or less systematic methods are appropriate as a first approach. Also, extrapolation of local densities to larger areas must be cautiously applied according to sampling effort and based upon proper statistical design. Some large-scale surveys are currently being conducted in Argentinean Patagonia, including modelling (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and aerial surveys using systematic, digital photographs taken along flight transects. In Chilean mountainous environments survey techniques are in the experimental phase using Monte-Carlo modelling and geostatistical-based estimates.</p><p>Guanaco population:</p><p></p><ul><li>Peru: 3,000</li><li>Bolivia: 150-200</li><li>Paraguay: 20-100</li><li>Chile: 270,000-299,000</li><li>Argentina: 1,225,000-1,890,000</li></ul>Total&#160;Guanaco population: 1,498,170-2,192,300<p></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Trend:&#160; Increasing. Although the global population estimate is higher than previous assessments, current approaches take into account new information and methods of estimation (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Zubillaga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em> 2015). <span lang=""EN-US"">Under-estimates and over-estimates have occurred in the past because of incomplete and inaccurate population-survey methodologies, especially in low population densities over the vast areas involved.&#160; <span lang=""EN-GB"">Also, some large areas previously unknown have been recently surveyed.&#160; At the same time, high-numbered populations in the Argentine and Chilean Patagonia have experienced significant growth in the past number of years <span lang=""EN-US"">(Zubillaga <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, caution should be noted that although numbers have seemingly increased in the far southern cone of South America, in the balance of the Guanaco’s distribution, populations are small and in real decline or at best tenuously stable, such as in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Chile, and Nnrthern Argentina (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).</span></span></p>",Increasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a widespread species with an extensive, although discontinuous, range from the northern Peru (8°30’ S) to Navarino Island (55°S) in southern Chile, from the Pacific Ocean in the northwest to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast, and from the sea level to 5,000 meters elevation in the Andean Mountains (Franklin 1982, González<em> et al. </em>2006, González in prep.).<br/><br/>However, its distribution has been severely impacted by human beings. Constant hunting, human occupation and fragmentation of habitat, competition with livestock, and the installation of fences (<span lang=""EN-US"">Torres 1992, Franklin <em>et al. </em>1997, González <em>et al. </em>2006) have reduced the Guanaco’s distribution to only 26% of its original distribution (calculated by Ceballos <span lang=""EN-US"">and<span lang=""EN-US""> Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Clearly numerous local populations have become extirpated generating a distribution highly fragmented in many regions (Housse 1930, MacDonagh 1949, Mann <em>et al. </em>1953, Cunazza<em> et al. </em>1995, Torres 1992, González <em>et al. </em>2006, Baigún <em>et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>In Peru the northernmost population of Guanacos in South America occurs at 8°30'S (Franklin 1975, Linares <em>et al. </em>2010) in the Calipuy National Reserve in the La Libertad Department. To the south, populations reach the Salinas Aguada Blanca National Reserve in the departments of Arequipa and Moquegua (16°10'S), and a Guanaco population has been recorded in the Nevado Salcantay area in the Anta District (Wheeler 2006, Veliz and Hoces 2007).<br/><br/>In Bolivia, a relict population of Guanaco persists in the Chaco region (Cuéllar and Fuentes 2000) and recent sightings have been reported in the southern highlands between Potosi and Chuquisaca (Nuñez 2008). Although Pinaya (1990) reported the presence of Guanacos in southeastern Tarija, these records are in need of confirmation.<br/><br/>In Paraguay, a small relict population has been reported in the northwestern Chaco (Villalba 2004).<br/><br/>In Chile Guanacos occur from near Putre village at the northern border with Peru to Navarino Island in the far southern Fueguian zone (González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The largest Guanaco populations in Chile are concentrated in the Magallanes and Aysén regions in the far south.&#160; In the remainder of the country, small and fragmented Guanaco populations occur in the Andean foothills of the extreme north, scattered small pockets along the coast, the north-central zone in the lower Andes, and central Chile exclusively in the Andes (González 2010a, González<em> et al.&#160;</em>2013).<br/><br/>In Argentina most of the world’s remaining Guanacos are found. Although its range covers nearly all of the Argentine Patagonia, Guanaco populations appear to be more scattered towards the northern provinces of the country (Chubut, Río Negro, Neuquén, and Mendoza) compared to the southern region (Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego; Baigun <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Throughout northern Patagonia, distribution is highly fragmented in relict populations in the La Pampa and southwestern Buenos Aires Provinces. In central and northern Argentina, Guanaco distribution is restricted to the western half of the country along the pre-Andean and Andean mountains up to the border with Bolivia (Baigún <em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recently a relict population has been reported in the arid Chaco of northwestern Córdoba (Schneider <em>et al</em>. unpublished data) and in Córdoba Guanacos have been reintroduced (Barri and Cufré 2014).</span></span></p>","<p>The call for the management and wise use of Guanaco products (fine undercoat/fiber and meat) put forth over the past several decades as an alternative approach to traditional conservation and strict protection (Franklin and Fritz 1991, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 1997) is now in the pioneering stages trying to establish itself as a wildlife production system (Hudson 1989). Research and application of meat harvest programs have been conducted on Tierra del Fuego, Chile, after monitoring population (Skewes<em> et al.</em>&#160;1999, Skewes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Soto 2010). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Nearly 23,000 animals have been harvested for meat between 2003 and 2015 in Chilean Tierra del Fuego with products primarily exported or used in the local market (N. Soto, pers. com. 2016). <span lang=""EN-US"">Fiber utilization was achieved initially from Guanaco farm individuals captured in the wild as newborns and raised in captivity during the 1980s and 1990s (Bas and González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000), but this approach has largely been discontinued because of high husbandry costs and world instability in the specialty-fiber market.&#160; Another approach, as mentioned above, holds more long-term promise from capturing, shearing and releasing of individuals in wild populations in programs being developed in Argentina. Finally, non-consumptive use, such as tourism, has also helped promote the aesthetic value of the species, especially in wild protected areas (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997).<br/></span><br/>A major management program funded by the government is currently being developed in the Patagonia of Argentina for fine-fiber utilization of wild-live captured animals on protected areas. This type of management was at its height during the last decade between 2004-2008 when some 11,000 Guanacos were shorn (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Lichtenstein 2013). Since then the number of animals has decreased due to international price variations for crude fiber. As a result, there has been a strong incentive to generate Guanaco fiber products as the local level, including yarn and thread (Lichtenstein pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services and Values<br/></strong>The importance of the Guanaco is based upon a multiple set of values (González 2010b). The most basic is its ecocentric or intrinsic value, that is, as a species its right to live, to exist, independent of the importance of the species to humans. This is an ethical base tangentially related to different groups and non-government organizations within the protective laws of each country.<br/><br/>There are a myriad of anthropocentric values that refer to the importance of a species to humans. The species provides multiple benefits to society, or ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) that are imparted to different segments of human society (Ojasti 2000). Guanacos provide regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services at different time and space scales. The benefits of the Guanaco to humans can be assessed by a number of values:</p><p></p><ul><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Existence Value&#160;</strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">that can be achieved through investment or payment to insure the existence of Guanaco populations without assumptions for its later use, is still in the beginning stages for this species.&#160; Nevertheless, the work of private organizations like Wildlife Foundation, Patagonia Conservation, and the Wildlife Conservation Society have indirectly assured the Guanaco’s future by acquiring large-land holdings for the conservation of ecosystems that include the species.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Evolutionary Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>through the Guanaco’s heritage of nearly 40 million years of evolution from its ancestors in North American (Franklin 1982, in press) and its anatomical and physiological adaptations (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), its adaptiveness has enabled the species to become the dominate-wild mammal in Patagonia and parts of the Andean mountains of South America (Franklin 2011). This value is important when management is planned and its use is assessed, especially when contrasted with introduced-exotic animals.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Ecological Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>the Guanaco has a major role and broad component in the trophic and ecological network of the South American Andean, Patagonia, and aridland ecosystems. It has been observed that in the absence of this large herbivore, the Puma will consume other prey that are of importance to humans, namely domestic sheep (Novaro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Laguna <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The Guanaco modifies plant growth in such a way that reduces dry matter prone to fire (Fuentes and Muñoz 1995) and disseminates seeds through the use of dung piles that promotes the recycling of nutrients and colonization of degraded soils (Cortés <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Henríquez 2004, Cavieres and Fajardo 2005). In addition, the padded feet of Guanacos do far less damage to soft soils compared to cloven hoofed livestock (König <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, König <em>et al</em>. 2015). They are also an important prey of predators and their remains are significant to scavenging animals, all of which contribute to ecosystem health and cycles.</span></li><li><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">Productive <span lang=""EN-GB"">Value</span></strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>,</strong> applies to a number managed Guanaco populations for the important production of fibre (hair) and meat (see section on Use and Trade).

All indigenous cultures associated with the deserts, Andean mountains, and the Patagonian and Fuegian zones utilized the Guanaco, and in some cases depended upon the species for food, clothing, shelter, and artistic and spiritual inspiration (Miller 1982). Its ethnic value was paramount, thanks to the process of domestication in the Central Andes, in the creation of the domestic Llama (Wheeler 1995).

Also, Pablo Neruda in his work “Canto General” (<em>General Song</em> in English) of 1950, dedicated words to the Guanaco in several of his poems. In addition, the Guanaco has been featured in major popular magazine articles and a number of television specials and documentaries by Nova, Nature, Discovery and National Geographic seen by multi-millions of people (see for details <a href=""http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf"">http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf</a>).</span></li></ul><p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco occurs in a number of protected areas and is included in Appendix II of CITES, thus regulating its international commerce of meat and fine-fiber products to insure that such trade does not threaten the Guanaco’s survival. &#160;In selected areas the sale of Guanaco products in local and international markets has contributed to its “species value” in recovered populations that can be used for reducing human-Guanaco conflict with ranchers and forestry production.&#160; Precaution needs to keep in mind for numerically depressed populations where consumptive and commerce use could irreversibly affect population stability; because of such potential problems, national legislation and international control via CITIES and other programs are relevant and important.<span lang=""EN-US""></span></p><p></p><ul><li>Peru. Recent legislation ratifies the alarming status of the Guanaco in Peru classifying it as Critically Endangered (Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego 2014). Governmental management of populations has been changed from CONACS (Consejo Nacional de Camélidos Sudamericanos = National Council for South American Camelids) to SERFOR (Servicio Forestal = Forestry Service) and local communities.</li><li>Bolivia. The government is working with local NGOs and authorities to strengthen the management of protected areas for the species. The government has issued an official notice to law enforcement offices in relevant regions concerning the protection of the Guanaco. The main conservation aim has been achieved thanks to the permanent presence of trained indigenous parabiologists and park rangers in the remaining range of the species (Cuéllar unpub. data). The situation is similar in Paraguay were the population is very small and the local NGOs and governmental institutions are working to maintain and protect the last remaining populations of Guanacos in the country.</li><li>Chile. The species is protected by the National Hunting Law (Ley de Caza) that regulates hunting, breeding, and in situ use. However, personnel for law enforcement are insufficient. Only 4% of the country’s Guanaco habitat has effective protection (8,354 km<sup>2</sup> in 8 National Parks and 4 Reserves). Additionally, there are fiscal and private areas where hunting is prohibited, either with relict populations (7,750 km<sup>2</sup>) or that directly protect the species (1,212 km<sup>2</sup>). A National Management Plan does not exist, but regionally a Conservation Plan has been developed for northern and central Chile (Grimberg 2010). Finally, Guanacos have been classified as Vulnerable in northern and central Chile and Least Concern in southernmost Chile by the Environmental Ministry (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente 2012), where the Guanaco is included in environmental assessment of investment projects such as mining, energy, infrastructure, and others.</li><li>Argentina. A National Management Plan (Plan Nacional de Manejo del Guanaco, Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) was prepared in 2006 and endorsed by the provinces with the highest Guanaco densities. The plan was coordinated by the Federal Wildlife Agency (Dirección de Fauna Silvestre) involving local institutions with its main focus on the Patagonia. The Federal Wildlife Conservation Law (Ley Nacional de Conservación de la Fauna) and various provincial acts provide a legal basis for the protection and use of the species. In Patagonia, Guanaco conservation measures include sustainable use of the species in the wild, regulation of hunting, and closing of some access routes and oil trails. Nevertheless, law enforcement capacity is low since most provinces lack sufficient personnel and equipment to control vast areas. Protected areas in the Patagonian steppe would encompass 10% of the Guanaco population if effective, but most protected areas are rather nominal as they contain livestock, lack wildlife guards, and poaching is common. The percentage of the area under effective protection in the Patagonian steppe is estimated at a disconcerting level of less than 1% (Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). In the central provinces there are eleven protected areas (national, provincial and private). In general, progress has been made in legislation and management tools, but implementation is needed.</li></ul><p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The Smooth-coated Otter is essentially an otter of lowlands and floodplains. Major threats to this species are loss of wetland habitats due to construction of large-scale hydroelectric projects, reclamation of wetlands for settlements and agriculture, reduction in prey biomass, poaching and contamination of waterways by pesticides. In most Asian countries where there has been increased human population during the last century, inadequate and ineffective rural development programmes have not been able to address the problems of poverty, forcing people to be more and more dependent on natural resources. Consequently, most of the wetlands and waterways do not have an adequate prey base for sustaining otter populations. Wetlands and waterways are polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides. Increased pesticide use is not only regarded as a major obstacle to the development of rice-fish culture, but also poses a danger to all predators feeding on aquatic prey in the area. In the entire south and southeast Asia there is severe conflict between otters and humans, because of poverty and recent increases in aquaculture activities leading to indiscriminate killing of otters. In south and southeast Asian countries, prevalent poaching pressure is affecting its survival. Given the extent of loss of habitat that is occurring in south and southeast Asia and the intensity of poaching a reduction in otter population size has been observed in many parts of its range (Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Hussain 2002, Nawab and Hussain 2012). It is believed that the population has been wiped out from most parts of its range in Iraq due to intensive poaching pressure (Al-Sheikhly 2012). During 1991 -2003 wide areas of reed beds and lakes of southern Iraq marshes were reclaimed affecting otter population, though recent surveys have confirmed their persistence from southern as well as northern Iraq (Al-Sheikhly and Nader 2013). In view of these, it is concluded that although the quantitative data on population sizes and trends are lacking, it is inferred that the global population of the Smooth-coated Otter has declined by more than 30% over the past 30 years (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;</p>","The Smooth-coated Otter is essentially a plains otter. In the Indian subcontinent they are adapted to live even in the semiarid region of northwestern India and Deccan plateau (Prater 1971). Generally, it uses large rivers and lakes, peat swamp forests, mangroves and estuaries, and it even uses the rice fields for foraging (Foster-Turly 1992). In southeast Asia rice fields appear to be one of the most suitable habitats in supporting its viable populations (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). However, they were more abundant in the mangroves of Kuala Gula, Malaysia as compared to the rain forest rivers (Shariff 1984). <br/><br/>Along the large rivers in India, the Smooth-coated Otters prefer rocky stretches since these stretches provide sites for den and resting. River stretches with bank side vegetation and marshes are used in proportion to their availability especially in summer as they provide ample cover while travelling or foraging. Open clayey and sandy banks are largely avoided as they lack escape covers (Hussain 1993; Hussain and Choudhury 1995, 1997). In the Tarai areas of the upper Gangetic plains the Smooth-coated Otters use seasonally flooded swamps during monsoon (July-September) and in early winter (October-February). Winter being the breeding season, the swamps are extensively used as natal den sites and nursery. By February-March the swamps begin to dry and the fish biomass appears to be depleted, consequently the otters move to the perennial rivers (Hussain and Choudhury 1997). In west Java, the Smooth-coated Otters prefer mangroves and tidal stretches of the rivers and rice fields. Freshwater swamps and coastal stretches lacking vegetation are avoided (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In rice fields and pond areas they prefer sites having moderate diversity of vegetation. Rivers with moderate to slow or stagnant water and water bodies having a width of 10-40 m are preferred. In Huai Kha Khaeng, Thailand, the Smooth-coated Otters extensively use the slowly meandering river near the dam and the dam itself (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otter is predominantly a fish eater, but supplements its diet with shrimp/crayfish, crab and insects, and other vertebrates such as frog, mudskippers, birds and rats (Prater 1971, Foster-Turly 1992, Hussain and Choudhury 1998).  In general, its diet is similar to that of Eurasian Otter. The range of fish in the diet varies from 75% to 100% (Tiler <em>et al</em>. 1989, Foster-Turly 1992, Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Hussain and Choudhury 1998).<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otters exhibit the typical opportunistic feeding behaviour similar to the Eurasian Otter. Along the major rivers in India they eat more fish, often making up to 94% of the total diet (Hussain and Choudhury 1998), while along the coast in mangrove habitats and in rice fields it ranges between 75-100% (Foster-Turly 1992, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In west Java otters inhabiting mangrove areas eat more of crustaceans, around 22% of the scats contain remains of crab and shrimp where as in the paddy fields in Malaysia, along with fish they tend to eat more rice field rats <em>Rattus argentiventer</em>,  represented in 23% of the spraints (Foster-Turly 1992). <br/><br/>Hussain (1993) identified 12 fish species from the spraint of Smooth-coated Otter from the Chambal River, of which seven species were eaten throughout the year. <em>Rhinomugil corsula</em> (Mugilidae) and <em>Rita rit</em>a (Bagaridae) were the preferred species. At least eight species of fish were identified from the spraints from Malaysia (Foster-Turly 1992).  Some of these include Gourami (<em>Trichogater </em>spp<em>.</em>), Climbing Perch (<em>Anabis testudineus</em>), catfish (<em>Clarius </em>spp<em>.</em>), snakehead (<em>Channa </em>spp<em>.</em>) and mudskipper (<em>Gobioidei</em>). In the rice fields they ate large amount of most common fish (<em>Trichogater</em> and <em>Anabis </em>spp.). The size of the fish consumed varied from 5-46 cm, often ranging between 15-30 cm (Wayre 1978). No significant relationship was found between the calorific values of the fish and the quantities consumed. Thus, the prey selection by Smooth-coated Otter is mainly influenced by its availability (Hussain 1993).<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otter attains sexual maturity at twenty-two months in captivity (Desai 1974). Yadav (1967) observed first litter at four years of age. In captivity they mate during August to October in water followed by prolonged playful bouts between partners (Desai, 1974, Naidu and Malhotra 1989). Copulation takes place several times daily. Males are polygamous mating with up to four females (Desai 1974). In the wild in northern India mating occurs in August-September and littering in November-December (Hussain 1993). Desai (1974) observed litter size of 2-5 (mean = 3.25). Similarly, Naidu and Malhotra (1989) observed litter size 1-5. The breeding schedule of Smooth-coated Otters in the wild in India corresponds with the captive records (Hussain 1993, 1996). Evidences of littering have been recorded in October and the cubs were seen out of the den in February. The mean litter size along the Chambal River was three (Hussain 1996).<br/><br/>Based on the percentage of active telemetry recordings, Hussain (1993) observed that the overall activity pattern of Smooth-coated Otters along the Chambal River in India was in the form of a bimodal curve in which two period of high activity were separated by a period of relative inactivity. This pattern of activity varied considerably among seasons. In summer, the relative period of inactivity was greater than in winter or monsoons. A significant difference was also found between day and night time activities in different seasons. Otters were more diurnal during winter than in summer or monsoon. <br/><br/>Hussain (1993) observed daily movements of four radio-implanted Smooth-coated Otters of different age and sex within their home range. Two types of movements were identified; small-scale movements associated with foraging in a restricted area close to dens, and more extensive travels between dens and foraging sites. Most of the movement was restricted between 250 to 1,500 m. A typical group of Smooth-coated Otter consisting of male, female, and up to four young ones require 7 to 12 km of river for their territory and an even longer stretch of shoreline if living along the coast (Wayre 1974). During a radio-tracking study along the Chambal River, India, the home range of all the otters tracked overlapped intensively. Among the radio-implanted otters, the maximum home range was observed in sub-adult male and the minimum in juvenile female and male. Among the non-tagged otters, the home range of female with cubs was estimated as 5.5 km. In case of the adult male it was estimated to be approximately 17 km (Hussain 1993). Along the Chambal River, the home range length and area of smooth-coated otter was less than that of Eurasian Otter, in Perthshire, Scotland and North American River Otter <em>Lontra canadensi</em>s in Idaho (Melquist and Hornocker 1983), but larger than that of Eurasian Otter (Erlinge 1967) in Sweden.","Major threats to Asian otter populations are loss of wetland habitats due to construction of large-scale hydroelectric projects, reclamation of wetlands for settlements and agriculture, reduction in prey biomass, poaching and contamination of waterways by pesticides. In most Asian countries although there has been increased human population during the last century, inadequate and ineffective rural development programmes have not been able to address the problems of poverty, forcing people to be more and more dependent on natural resources (Badola 1997). Consequently, most of the wetlands and waterways do not have adequate prey base for sustaining otter populations. Wetlands and waterways are polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates through agricultural runoffs. Increased pesticide use is not only regarded as a major obstacle to the development of rice-fish culture, but also poses a danger to all predators feeding on aquatic prey in the area (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the entire south and southeast Asia there is severe conflict between otters and humans, because of poverty and recent increase in aquaculture activities leading to indiscriminate killing of otters. Many important habitats of smooth otter have been lost to development activities. In southeast Asian countries, there does not seem to be any intentional otter trapping (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996) though it is prevalent in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.","Because of the secretive and nocturnal behaviour of Smooth-coated Otter, reliable estimates of its population are not available. In southeast Asia it is found in large groups (Foster-Turly 1992, Hussain 1993, Hussain 1996) where the basic family group consists of an adult female and her offspring, the father of the offspring, and older siblings may often join the group (Lekagul and McNeely 1988, Hussain 1996). The group size varies considerably between months and seasons, the group being largest during the monsoon period (Hussain 1996). Along the Chambal River in central India the group size ranges from 1-9 individuals (mean=4.62). During a study conducted in the Corbett Tiger Reserve, in north India an estimate of 41 individuals (35 adults and 6 juveniles) with a mean of 5.1±1.55 was recorded from the 85 km of river stretch within the Reserve (Nawab and Hussain 2007).",Decreasing,"The Smooth-coated Otter is distributed throughout south Asia and southeast Asia. Its distribution is continuous from Indonesia, through southeast Asia, and westwards from southern China to India and Pakistan, with an isolated subpopulation in Iraq (Pocock 1941, Medway 1969, Hussain 1993). Though its current status in the Middle East is not known, its presence has been confirmed from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, southwest China, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia (Penisular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak), and Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Java) and Brunei (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Corbet and Hill 1992, Wozencraft 1993).",Species is illegally utilized in wildlife trade.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Since 1977, the Smooth-coated Otter has been listed on Appendix II of CITES. However, most range countries are not able to control the clandestine trade leading to extensive poaching. Nevertheless, it is a protected species in almost all the range countries which prohibits its killing.<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otter, once common in the wetlands and low lying areas of south Asia, is now restricted to a few protected areas. Creation of networks of Protected Areas, identification of sites as wetland of national and International importance under Ramsar Convention has to some extent halted the degradation of its habitat. <br/><br/>Over the years the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group has developed a cadre of biologist across Asia to conduct field surveys and has popularize otter conservation by promoting otters as ambassadors of the wetlands. However, concerted efforts to conserve this species are needed.

21935287,12419,Lutra lutra,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Eurasian Otter is considered to be Near Threatened due to an ongoing population decline, but at a rate no longer exceeding 30% over the past three generations or 23 years (generation length based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). It nearly qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2cde. In recent years, there has been ample evidence that its population is recovering in western Europe and that viable subpopulations occur in the former USSR and many parts of south and southeast Asia. The information on Eurasian Otter occurrence in the Russian Federation especially in Siberia and in the Russian Far East is much improved. The Eurasian Otter is common on the Kamchatka Peninsula and is also on&#160;Chukotka Peninsula. There are a number of new records of Eurasian Otter from different parts of Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia (Dr. Alexander P. Saveljev, Department of Animal Ecology, Head, Russian Research Institute of Game Management and Fur Farming, pers. comm.). <br/><br/>The species was listed on The IUCN Red List as Near Threatened in 2004 and 2008 based on declines in parts of the range, the lack of information from many parts of its range, and the sensitivity of the species to sudden changes in threats. The listings also took into account the status of subpopulations in the far east - China and Indo-China, where it was thought they might be declining because of possible over-exploitation. <br/><br/>This Near Threatened assessment is more of a precautionary listing, as it indicates that while the recovery in western Europe is genuine that the conservation actions for this species need to be sustained. Besides, there is still concern about what is happening in parts of its range in Asia due increasing habitat loss and poaching.","The Eurasian Otter lives in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas independent of their size, origin or latitude (Mason and Macdonald 1986). In Europe they are found in the brackish waters from the sea level up to 1,000 m in the Alps (Ruiz-Olmo and Gosalbez 1997) and above 3,500 m in the Himalayas (Prater 1971) or 4,120 m in Tibet (Mason and Macdonald 1986). In the Indian sub-continent, Eurasian Otters occur in cold hill and mountain streams. During summer (April - June) in the Himalayas they may ascend up to 3,660 m. These upward movements probably coincide with the upward migration of the carp and other fish for spawning. With the advent of winter the otters come down to lower altitudes (Prater 1971). In a study conducted in Thailand in Huai Kha Khaeng where the Eurasian, Smooth-coated and Small-clawed Otters live sympatrically, Kruuk <em>et al</em>. (1994) found that the Eurasian Otters used rapidly flowing upper parts of the river. In Sri Lanka the Eurasian Otter was living in the headwaters of all the five river systems but not in the estuaries (de Silva 1996).<br/><br/>In most parts of its range, its occurrence is correlated with bank side vegetation showing importance of vegetation to otters (Mason and Macdonald 1986). Otters in different regions may depend upon differing features of the habitat, but to breed, they need holes in the river bank, cavities among tree roots, piles of rock, wood or debris. The Eurasian Otters are closely connected to a linear living space. Most portion of their activity is concentrated to a narrow strip on either side of the interface between water and land (Kruuk 1995). Otter distribution in coastal areas especially the location of holts, is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1989, Beja 1992).<br/><br/>Within the group home range, shared by resident adult females, each had her own core area. Resident males had larger home ranges in more exposed parts of the coast which overlapped with other males and with at least two female group ranges. Male and female transients moved through group ranges, relegated to less favoured holts, habitat and food. In freshwater home ranges are longer for both sexes (Kruuk 1995). Erlinge (1969) suggested that males were hierarchical and territorial, influenced by sexual factors, while female ranges were influenced by food and shelter requirements of the family group. Green et al. (1984) and Kruuk (1995) found that adult males spent most of their time along the main rivers, whereas adult females occupied tributaries or lakes, as they did in Austria (Kranz 1995). Rosoux (1995) found no sexual differences in habitat utilization and considerable overlaps in range. Young animals usually occupied peripheral habitat, but Green and Green (1983) found differences between immature and mature young males, the later having access to all available habitat and the other restricted to marginal habitat, supplemented by visits to the main river when vacant, temporally or spatially. While males generally have larger ranges than females in the same habitat, sizes vary according to the type and productivity of the habitat, and methods of measuring ranges vary from study to study.<br/><br/>Like most <em>Lutra </em>species, fish is the major prey of Eurasian Otters sometimes exceeding more than 80% of their diet (Erlinge 1969, Webb 1975, Ruiz-Olmo and Palazon 1997). In addition to fish a whole range of other prey items have been recorded in their diet in variable proportions. These include aquatic insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, small mammals, and crustaceans (Jenkins et al. 1980, Adrian and Delibes 1987, Skaren 1993). In a study conducted in Sri Lanka, Silva (1996) reported that the overall diet of the Eurasian otters consisted of 81.2% of crab, 37.5% fish and 8.7% frog. In addition to these the diet also included small quantities of water snakes, birds, small mammals and insects.<br/><br/>The percentage of crab in the diet of the Eurasian Otters in Sri Lanka varied from 72% to 85%, and fish from 25-31%. There was significant seasonal variation in the diet in different habitats. The relative importance of fish in the diet was significantly higher in the reservoirs and lakes than the rivers and streams. Crabs were more important to otters inhabiting streams than those inhabiting rivers and lakes. Crabs were eaten more than fish during the monsoon (de Silva 1997). However, in Huai Kha Kheng, Thailand 76% of the spraint had fish, 64% amphibians and 7% crab (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994). The Eurasian Otter is capable of taking fish as large as 9 kg (Chanin 1985), however, many studies in Europe have revealed that the fish consumed by the Eurasian Otters are relatively small with a median length of 13 cm (Kruuk 1995).<br/><br/>The Eurasian Otter is largely solitary and the adult otters tend not to associate with other adults except for reproduction. The family group of mother and offspring is the most important unit of otter society. In Shetland, where several adult animals used the same stretch of coast, encounters between adults were rare (Kruuk 1995) and the species was strikingly non-social. Kranz (1995) found evidence of social group formation beyond the occasional associations of two or more family groups, which suggests that under some circumstances otters of all ages and sexes may form temporary mutually tolerant gatherings.<br/><br/>In most of its range the Eurasian Otter is predominantly nocturnal (Green <em>et al</em>. 1984). The exception is Shetland, where otters were entirely diurnal (Kruuk 1995). Green <em>et al</em>. (1984) found that activity was largely circumscribed by the solar rhythm so that the duration of activity varied through the year with night length. The reverse situation was found in Shetland with activity restricted by the day length (Kruuk 1995). Some workers have found a break in activity in the middle of longer nights or days and single peak around midnight or midday in shorter nights or days, although up to four activity periods per night has been recorded. Kruuk (1995) links otter activity to that of prey species, with the favoured marine species more vulnerable in daylight and those in freshwater easier to catch at night. In coastal habitats, tidal patterns influence otter activity, with significant preference shown for feeding at low tide, both in Shetland and on the Scottish west coast (Kruuk 1995).<br/><br/>The Eurasian Otter attains sexual maturity at around 18 months in males and 24 months in the case of females, but in captivity it is usually three to four years (Reuther 1991). They are non-seasonally polyoestrous (Trowbridge 1983), mating in captivity has been observed at all times of the year (Reuther 1999). The gestation period is approximately 63-65 days, the litter size varies from 1 to 5, and the life expectancy is around 17 years (Acharjyo and Mishra 1983).","The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalization of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, draining of wetlands, aquaculture activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). In south and southeast Asia, the decrease in prey species from wetlands and water ways had reduced the population to an unsustainable threshold leading to local extinctions. Poaching is one of the main causes of its decline in south and southeast Asia, and possibly also in north Asia.<br/><br/>Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilizers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry.<br/><br/>In addition, major causes of mortality from range countries are drowning and road kills. Fyke nets set for eels or for fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans have a great attraction to otters and a high risk to those that successfully try to enter these traps.<br/><br/>A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).<br/><br/>There is an ongoing discussion about the problem of reintroduction of otters. In recent years it is feared that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population (Mason 1992, Reuther 1998).","In spite of several studies, the status of its population is not known from many parts of its range, particularly from North Africa and Asia. The overall estimate of the population in United Kingdom was around 10,395 individuals in 2004 (JNCC 2007). The status of its distribution has been reviewed by Conroy and Chanin (1998) which gives a complete picture of its occurrence, though information on its abundance is lacking in this review. As far as its abundance is concerned limited information is available so as to get a clear picture of its status. In Shetland, otters averaged 1/km of shore, but each otter used several, overlapping km of shore. An estimated nine adult female produced a mean of total 5.6 litters/year. The estimated juvenile female per 100 female attaining the first reproduction was 33.7 individuals in Shetland (Kruuk <em>et al.</em> 1989). In central Finland between 1985 and 2003 the temporal and spatial variation in the density of otter population was 52 otters, including 16 cubs in 11 litters in an area of 1,650 km² in 2002–2003. Harris <em>et al.</em> (1995) estimated the density of otters in England as one adult per 27 linear km of river (1/24 km in the ‘high density’ area of Scotland. However, such information is lacking from other range countries. There is absolutely no information about its population status in Asia where it is believed to be under tremendous pressure because of poaching.",Decreasing,"The Eurasian Otter has one of the widest distributions of all Palaearctic mammals (Ando and Corbet 1966). Its range covers parts of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. Its current distribution in Europe is marked by a large corridor, stretching from central Denmark, via the western parts of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the eastern parts of France, Switzerland, the western parts of Austria to central Italy, where the otter is extinct or reduced to small and sometimes isolated subpopulations. Information for Russia, which forms a link between Europe and Asia, is fragmented. It seems that the otter is distributed throughout the country with the exception of the tundra and the northern regions with permanent frost. The southern border of the Eurasian Otter's range in the Near and Middle East is formed by Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Iran. It is also reported from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in Africa north of Sahara. In south Asia the species has been reported from almost all countries especially from the Himalayan river systems in Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and eastwards throughout Southeast Asia to Japan where it believed to be extinct. <br/><br/>There are several open questions about its occurrence in the Southeast Asian region. It seems that the Eurasian Otter reached the island of Sumatra but, did not reach the island of Java. Conroy <em>et al.</em> (1998) are not sure if the evidence of otters on the island of Borneo really relates to the Eurasian Otter. Its occurrence has been confirmed from South Korea, southern China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Bangladesh (Lekagul and McNeely 1988, Hussain 1999). In India it occurs in northern, northeast and southern India. Formerly widely distributed in Japan, it is now believed to be extinct (Ando <em>et al</em>. 2007). Once widespread in the rivers of northern Mongolia (Mallon 1985), along the rivers of Mongol Altai Mountain Range, and along the Halh River in Ikh Hyangan Mountain Range (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980). It has also been reported from downstream of the Tengis River in northern parts of Hövsgöl Mountain Range (Tsagaan 1975, 1977) and around the Eröö River Basin in western Hentii Mountain Range (Tsendjav 2005). The Eurasian Otter can also be found occasionally along the Tes River in northern Hangai.",Animals are hunted for their pelts and for use as food.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The Eurasian Otter is strictly protected under international legislation and conventions.

The species was listed as Critically Endangered in the Mongolian Red Book (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em>. 1987).<br/><br/>A European Breeding Programme (EEP) for self-sustaining captive populations was started in 1985.

21936042,12420,Hydrictis maculicollis,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-06-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although this species has a large distribution they are restricted to areas of permanent fresh water, offering good shoreline cover and an abundant prey base. Thus while the distribution range is large, the spatial size of their occupied habitats is much smaller and unknown, particularly due to the widespread habitat destruction and pollution problems reported for much of the African continent. The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. Both this decrease in suitable habitat and increase in human/otter conflict are currently occurring and will certainly increase over the next three generations.<br/><br/>This reassessment is based on a perceived (in regions where studies have been conducted) (Akpona <em>et al</em>. 2011, Reed-Smith in prep.) and assumed (in regions where no studies have been done) population decline over the last 16 years and beyond. In much of their range, populations of Spotted-necked Otters are faced with habitat loss or degradation, polluted waters, and/or degraded water ecosystems due to the introduction of exotic species such as Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>) and Nile Perch (<em>Lates niloticus</em>) and marginal agricultural practices. This habitat disturbance is exacerbated by poor sanitation infrastructure and growing industrial waste pollution. Additionally, regional human populations are poor and increasingly placing pressure on all resources including water, vegetation, the otter prey base,as well as reducing suitable resting and denning sites vital to survival of the species.<br/><br/>For all of the above reasons and the lack of effective conservations measures currently a continued decline in the overall Spotted-necked Otter population of at least 20% is projected for the next three&#160; generations (23 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Therefore the species is listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A3cde; this is a precautionary listing.<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""></span>","<p>The Spotted-necked Otter inhabits freshwater habitats where water is un-silted, unpolluted, and rich in small to medium sized fishes (Reed-Smith 2010, d'Inzillo Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). While comparatively common in the great lakes of Central and East Africa, they are also found in streams, rivers and impoundments up to altitudes of 2,500 m (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996). In riparian and lacustrine habitats adequate vegetation in the form of long grass, reeds, dense bushes, overhanging trees and large boulder piles is essential to provide cover during periods of inactivity and for denning. Unlike African Clawless Otter, they do not occur in marine or estuarine waters.</p>","The Spotted-necked Otter is decreasing throughout its range, mainly as a result of the alteration or degradation of freshwater habitats and riparian vegetation. This rapid habitat loss is exacerbated by a growing, poor population engaged in unsustainable agricultural activity (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1992, 1995) and unsustainable fishing practices (LVFO 2008). These practices have led to bank and shoreline erosion, denuding of important vegetative cover used by the otters, increased human presence which is disruptive to otter denning, increased use of smaller mesh nets and poisoning to improve catches, and the change or depletion of the otters prey base (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). Pollution of waters with agricultural, livestock, and societal wastes also are threatening with evidence of the bioaccumulation of organochlorines and other biocontaminants recorded in Spotted-necked Otters (Mason and Rowe-Rowe 1992). The rate of otters becoming entangled in set and discarded fishing nets is impossible to determine. However, based on known entanglement of other species it has likely increased over the occasional drowning reported previously (Stuart 1985, Rowe-Rowe 1990).<br/><br/>Otters are also killed for food or skins, as a perceived threat to poultry, or as a competitor for fish (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Akpuna <em>et al</em>. 2011, Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2010). Introduction of alien fish species that out-compete the smaller indigenous fish was identified as a main threat for the Lake Victoria population (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and increased conflict with people is impacting all populations. The increase in human numbers dependent on fish as a source of protein is particularly threatening in the large East African lakes which are historically important refugia for this species. It has been reported that the introduction of Nile Perch into Lake Victoria and their impact on the diversity of the fish biomass in the lake is forcing a dietary shift for the otters (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). This shift in prey base has been observed (Reed-Smith 2010) but its full impact is unknown at this time particularly for areas outside of the protected national park where recent studies have occurred. The introduction of invasive alien species such as water  hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia</em>&#160;<em>crassipes</em>) is also degrading the water ecosystem.<br/><br/>The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. UNECA projected in a 1999 study that portions of the Spotted-necked Otter’s current range would be experiencing fresh water stress and scarcity by 2025 with much of the rest of its range considered vulnerable to these hydrologic issues.","Like other otter species, its abundance and density appear to be dependent, in part, on the availability of fish; consequently, this species was historically common or fairly common in the fish-rich Central African lakes, but generally uncommon or rare in the rest of Africa where fish faunas tend to be poor (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1995; d'Inzillo Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). In an area that included a highland stream and man-made lakes in South Africa, Perrin <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated one otter/1-2 km of stream, while in less suitable habitat Rowe-Rowe (1992) estimated one otter/6-11 km. In a more recent study (Kubheka <em>et al</em>. 2013) detected only 25% of the number of spraints located during two previous studies in an area of intense human disturbance but roughly the same number of spraints located in an undisturbed area during the latter 1993 study indicating a reduction in otter numbers in areas of increased human presence. In the Central and East African lakes, density was estimated at between one and two otters per kilometre of shoreline (Procter 1963, Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990, Lejeune and Frank 1990 cited in D’Inzilla-Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). A more recent study (2006 – 2011) of Lake Victoria detected what could be a similar abundance on portions of the protected shoreline of Rubondo Island National Park but local sources reported a perceived decline in, or absence of otters along other portions of the lake’s shorelines.<br/><br/>Their abundance also appears to be dependent on suitable habitat cover (Reed-Smith 2010) which includes dense vegetative cover and/or the presence of large, piled boulder shorelines. Early studies of this species inhabiting large East African lakes and South African riverine systems reported observations of group size ranging up to approximately 20 individuals (Rowe-Rowe and Somers 1998, Reed-Smith unpublished data). Recent studies in East Africa (Reed-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. in preparation, and unpublished data for Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) indicate population declines due to habitat loss, water course changes due to drought, increased human populations, and increased eradication of otters as perceived competitors as well as for consumption and traditional medicine. Based on informant interviews in East Africa (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2010 and unpublished data) as well as reports from other range countries this species is seldom observed or not seen as often as it was 10 years ago and groups of more than five are rarely seen. Over the last six years, areas of Lake Victoria where otters were routinely observed, informants now report rarely or never seeing them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, beyond these personal accounts there are very little data available on presence or status of this species throughout most of their historic range for the last fifteen years and only marginally more for the last 30 years. An additional problem in assessing their status is that throughout most of their range there is often no distinction made by local people between <em>H. maculicollis</em> and <em>Aonyx capensis</em> or <em>A. congicus</em> with which they can be sympatric.",Decreasing,"Spotted-necked Otters are found in lakes and larger rivers throughout much of Africa south of 10°N. They are common in Lake Victoria and across Zambia, but for some unexplained reason often are absent from what appear to be suitable habitats, such as the lakes and rivers, of East Africa and the Zambezi below Victoria Falls (Estes 1992). It is likely to be present throughout most of its historic range albeit, in reduced numbers due to habitat degradation, civil strife, polluted waterways, increasing human animosity towards this species, and use as a meat source (Reed-Smith 2010).<br/><br/>However, due to the paucity of current information their continued presence in Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Sudan is presumed. The species is believed to be extinct in Burundi, Ghana, Lesotho, and Togo (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Current reports indicate the Spotted-necked Otter is present in reduced numbers in Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2014). The large lakes of Central and East Africa and possibly the larger river systems are important sites for the conservation of this species.","Otters are killed for food, for medicinal purposes and for their skins.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Currently there are only a few regionally based conservation actions in place for this species (e.g African Otter Outreach Project, listed as Vulnerable in South Africa) and it is technically protected in all national parks.<br/><br/>They are present in several protected areas across their range but are little known and seldom seen by staff or visitors. Efforts should be made to educate range country park staff about all otter species and the role they play in a healthy ecosystem to increase awareness and protection for this species. This lack of knowledge by range country professionals is a significant conservation opportunity that can be taken advantage of by initiating an awareness campaign for all range country wildlife professionals. This campaign should be expanded to target human populations sharing their ecosystems with otters, particularly where traditional tales about otter behaviour are deleterious to the species future survival (e.g. otters rape women or raid young maize crops).<br/><br/>Another significant conservation action is taking steps to network with other field biologists working in ecosystems where otters are found. The creation of an easy system to report otter sightings would significantly contribute to our knowledge of their current distribution and aid researchers in future assessments of status and population trends in Africa where they inhabit areas that are hard to reach, or dangerous to survey due to the presence of crocodiles, hippopotamus, etc. Networking with other researchers to create synergy between conservation efforts also would benefit preservation of important otter habitats and ecosystems.<br/><br/>There is need for detailed studies on the distribution and current status of this species as well as conducting public relations campaigns to increase awareness of the presence of otters in Africa.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
21936349,12302,Lontra canadensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The North American River Otter is considered to be Least Concern as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otters had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have enabled river otters to reclaim portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring otter populations in many areas of the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States and water quality and development limit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives (Polechla 1990). There is an ongoing discussion about the problem of reintroduction of river otters. In recent years it is feared that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.","Historical records indicate that river otters were well established throughout most major drainages in the continental United States and Canada prior to European settlement (Hall 1981). The continent’s largest otter populations occurred in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England (Nilsson 1980, Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but viable, otter populations (Nilsson 1980). <br/><br/>North American River Otters prefer bog lakes with banked shores containing semi-aquatic mammal burrows and lakes with Beaver (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) lodges, and they avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994b). In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways and positively associated with the number of Beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity (Dubuc <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Idaho, river otters prefer valley over mountain habitats, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). Logjams are used intensively where present (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). In Florida, abundance of North American Otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forest. During the dry season, <em>L. canadensis</em> will retreat from marshland and move to permanent ponds where water is available and food is more concentrated (Humphrey and Zinn 1982). In Idaho and Massachusetts, habitat features preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, Beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water (Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Newman and Griffin 1994).<br/><br/>The diet of the North American River Otter is comprised mostly of fish that are abundant, mid-sized, and close to shore (Larsen 1984, Stenson <em>et al</em>. 1984), as well as amphibians (mostly frogs) and crustaceans (mainly crayfish) (Knudsen and Hale 1968, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1994a, Sheldon and Toll 1964). Small mammals, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and fruits are consumed opportunistically (Gilbert and Nancekivell 1982, Greer 1955, Hamilton 1961, Morejohn 1969, Verbeek and Morgan 1978, Wilson 1954). North American River Otters have few natural predators in the water: Alligators (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>), American Crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em>), and Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>). They are considerably more vulnerable on land or ice where Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), Cougars (<em>Felis concolor</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), Domestic Dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) and Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) can kill adults (Melquist and Dronkert 1987, Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Route and Peterson 1991, Toweill and Tabor 1982). Most mortality, however, is human-related and includes trapping, illegal shooting, road kills, and accidental captures in fish nets or set lines (Jackson 1961, Melquist and Hornocker 1983).<br/><br/>North American River Otters can reach 13 years of age in the wild and up to 25 years of age in captivity (Melquist and Dronkert 1987, Stephenson 1977). Females usually do not reproduce until two years of age, although yearlings occasionally produce young (Docktor <em>et al</em>. 1987, Hamilton and Eadie 1964). Males are sexually mature at 2 years of age (Hamilton and Eadie 1964). North American river otters usually breed from December to April (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Liers 1951), gestation lasts 61-63 days, and young are born between February and April (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Melquist and Hornocker 1983). Litter size may reach five (Park 1971) but usually ranges from one to three (Docktor <em>et al</em>. 1987, Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Tabor and Wight 1977).","Threats to otter populations in North America vary among regions and are influenced by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Prior to settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were widespread among aquatic habitats throughout most of the continent (Hall 1981). Unregulated trapping and loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries resulted in extirpations or declines in otter populations in many areas (Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Nilsson (1980) reviewed the status of otters in the United States and determined that populations were extirpated in 11 states and had experienced severe declines in nine other states. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported smaller fewer otter populations. Although the distribution of otters became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island (Polechla 1990). <br/><br/>During the 1970s, improvements in natural resource management techniques coincided with increased concern about otter declines in North America (Endangered Species Scientific Authority 1978). Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, including the use of reintroduction projects (Ralls 1990, Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1993). Since 1976 over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced among 21 states. Also, 29 states and all Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of North American Otters are similar for Canada and the United States (Obbard 1987), with most pelts being used in the garment industry (Toweill and Tabor 1982). In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached <em>ca</em> 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million (Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Otters are incidentally harvested by traps set for Beavers (Toweill and Tabor 1982), and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously (Polechla 1990). While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas (Lariviére and Walton 1998). <br/><br/>Oil spills present a localized threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other degradation of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution of otters and pose long-term threats if enforcement of water quality standards are not maintained and enforced. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality problem in some areas that eliminates otter prey prevents thereby inhibits recolonization or expansion of otter populations. Recently, there has been discussion of the long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1998). Similarly, many perceived threats to otters such as pollution and habitat alterations have not been rigorously evaluated.<br/><br/>The threat of disease to wild otter populations is poorly understood and has received little study (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1995). <em>Lontra canadensis</em> may be victim of canine distemper (Harris 1968, Park 1971), rabies (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1995), respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection (Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984, Route and Peterson 1991). In addition, North American Otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia (Harris 1968). North American Otters host numerous endoparasites such as nematodes (Hoberg <em>et al</em>. 1997), cestodes (Greer 1955), trematodes (Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984), the sporozoan <em>Isopora</em> (Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984), and acanthocephalans (Hoberg <em>et al</em>. 1997, Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984). Ectoparasites include ticks (Eley 1977, Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1992), sucking lice <em>Latagophthirus rauschi</em> (Kim and Emerson 1974), and the flea <em>Oropsylla arctomys</em> (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1992).","By the early 1900s, unregulated trapping, water pollution, and other degradations of aquatic and riparian habitats had caused otter populations to decline throughout most of their historic range (Nilsson 1980, Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Improvements in water quality and furbearer management strategies, including implementation of reintroduction projects, have enabled the re-establishment of otter populations to various aquatic habitats in portions of their former range. Reintroduction projects have been especially useful in restoring otter populations to riverine habitats in interior regions. <br/><br/>Methods for determining relative abundance of North American River Otters include track counts in the snow (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1987, St-Georges <em>et al.</em> 1995), radioactive isotopes (Knaus <em>et al</em>. 1983, Testa <em>et al</em>. 1994), catch/unit effort (Chilelli <em>et al</em>. 1996), and scent-station surveys (Humphrey and Zinn 1982). Density estimates of river otters range from one otter/1.25-3.60 km of coastline in Alaska (Testa <em>et al</em>. 1994) to one otter/3.9 km of waterway in Idaho (Melquist and Hornocker 1983).",Stable,"<em>Lontra canadensis</em> currently occurs throughout the United States of America and Canada. Originally this species is thought to have ranged from 250-700°N latitude and from 530 to 1660°W longitude. In the USA, this species is present in states bordering the Great Lakes, Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and in the forested regions of the Pacific coast in North America (Larivière and Walton 1998). It is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands and the north slope of the Brooks Range (Magoun and Valkenburg 1977). Urbanization and pollution caused reductions in range area and the species is now absent or rare in Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia (Melquist and Dronkert 1987, Park 1971, Polechla 1990). Reintroductions have expanded the distribution of this species in recent years, especially in the Midwestern United States (Melquist and Dronkert 1987). In Canada, North American River Otters occupy all provinces and territories, except for Prince Edward Island (Melquist and Dronkert 1987).",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The species is included in CITES Appendix II. Additional research is needed to clearly delineate the impact that various forms of water pollution, agricultural and other development along riparian habitats, industrial and housing development in coastal areas, cumulative impacts related to loss or alterations of wetlands, large flood control structures, and interactions that these and other factors have on otter populations.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Its populations are under rapid decline almost across mainland Southeast Asia, through trade-driven hunting (Duckworth and Hill 2008, Sheperd and Nijman 2014) and habitat degradation.This species is considered to be Endangered due to past population declines. The species is suspected to have declined by at least 50% or more in the past three generations (30 years based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) due to illegal poaching and hunting, pollution, by catch and prey depletion due to over fishing. It is suspected that the current rates of decline will to continue into the future and further threaten this species. In its entire range the Hairy-nosed Otter is under increasing pressure due to intensive poaching. In Cambodia, around the Tonle Sap Lake and other places, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common practice. In Viet Nam, otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, for meat and medical use. Wildlife trade involving <em>Lutra sumatrana</em> as pets was recorded several time in Indonesia. The same is true for other range countries. The principal threat to the fauna of the Southeast Asia is the burgeoning human population, and resultant pressure of this growth on natural resources. Lack of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressures on all wildlife species including the Hairy-nosed Otter. From these threats it is concluded that the Hairy-nosed Otter is under stress due to its restricted range, in which its habitat is under constant pressure and that there is every possibility of reduction in its population which has been inferred and future population is suspected to be under decline which may lead to decline in the area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality. Combined with all these factors, extensive illegal exploitation of the species may lead to its extinction unless appropriate conservation measures are taken. Therefore, the species have been confirmed as Endangered under criterion A2cde.</p>","In Thailand the Hairy-nosed Otter lives in Phru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forests (Kanchanasaka <em>et al</em>. 1998). In Viet Nam it has also been reported from the low lying peat swamp forests of U Minh Thuong Nature Reserve in Mekong Delta (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sage <em>et al</em>. 2004) and from Cambodia it has been reported from flooded forests of the Tonle Sap Lake inundation zone (Heng 2007) and in Melaleuca forests and in mangroves and estuaries along the coasts. It inhabits freshwater and coastal areas, especially mangroves in Indonesia. Wayre (1974, 1978) considered that the Hairy-nosed Otter mainly inhabited mountain streams above 300 m, Medway (1969) recorded it in the sea off Penang.<br/><br/>The Hairy-nosed Otter principally predates on fish (85.5%) followed by water snakes. They also supplement their diet with frogs, lizards, turtles, crabs, possibly small mammals and insects, although these may not be that important in its diet (Kanchanasaka 2007). Fish belonging to the families Channidae, Belontiidae, Anabantidae, Notopteridae, Synbranchidae, Clariidae, Nandidae, were identified in faecal samples from Thailand. The main prey identified were Three-spot Gourami (<em>Trichogaster trichopterus</em>), Common Climbing Perch (<em>Anabas testudineus</em>), and snakeheads (<em>Channa</em> spp.) (Kanchanasaka 2007).<br/><br/>Not much is known about its breeding behaviour but there is indication that it breeds in November-December in the Mekong delta. Kanchanasaka <em>et al</em>. (2003) found that gestation was around two months as with other otters, and cubs were seen in December to February, and one family observed consisted of both parents and a cub. Based on camera trapping in Cambodia, mating season of hairy-nosed otter could be during between November and March (S. Heng pers. comm. 2014).","The Hairy-nosed Otter has a limited distribution range. In Thailand, the otters are found in the Toa Daeng peat swamp forests, and also from near the mouth of the Bang Nara River which is low lying and tidal. In Viet Nam, the species have been reported from low lying peat swamp forests dominated by <em>Melaleuca cajuputi</em> in lower Mekong. In Cambodia, the species mainly lives around the Tonle Sap Lake where the otters live mainly in the flooded forest and scrub surrounding the lake. Like many predators the Hairy-nosed Otter occurs in low density and the number and frequency of sightings are very few.<br/><br/>In recent years, the tropical peat swamp forests are under severe threat due to the increasing frequency of fires and other anthropogenic activities such as clearing of forest to grow plantations of oil palm and food crops such as rice, corn and soya bean. Forest is also cleared for fish farming. In Viet Nam the entire Mekong Delta has been converted into rice fields reducing the habitat of otter and other wildlife species into a few pockets. In Malaysia (Sabah), fire reduced 70% of the Binsulok Forest Reserve and 10% of the Klias Forest Reserve. This has affected the surrounding environment and the biodiversity. In Indonesia over the last 20 years, the ecosystem has been reduced from almost 30 million hectares to only about 15 million hectares, and most of what remains has already been logged selectively. Such levels of habitat modification have profound effects on the native biodiversity.<br/><br/>In its entire range the Hairy-nosed Otter is under increasing pressure due to intensive poaching (Yoxon and Yoxon 2007). In Cambodia, around the Tonle Sap Lake, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common practice. In Viet Nam otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, and also for meat and medical use.<br/><br/>Populations in Viet Nam are known only from two small National Parks that are under intense pressure from the surrounding dense human population. Though there are other areas within the Mekong Delta that could contain other populations, with Mui Ca Mau the notable example, most are too small in size and suffering from similar problems to U Minh Ha and U Minh Thuong National Park.<br/><br/>The illegal wildlife trade continues to grow and is the main factor behind this species decline. This trade shows no signs of abating and is likely to continue to push this species towards extinction. The natural low density of this species, its terrestrial ecology and its dependence on ecosystems that are often the first to be converted into agricultural land makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.<br/><br/>The principal threat to the fauna of Southeast Asian region is the burgeoning human population, and resultant biomass demand which puts pressure on natural resources. Unavailability of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressure on all wildlife species including Hairy-nosed Otter.","<p>In its distribution range the species is considered as rare. It has been studied in Phru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forest in Thailand (Kanchanasaka <em>et al.</em> 1998), U Minh Thuong Nature Reserve in Viet Nam (Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2004) and in Tonle Sap from Cambodia (Poole 2003, Olsson <em>et al.</em> &#160;2007). However, their abundance or group sizes are not known. In U Minha National Park though it was estimated that there were around 50-230 individuals. The species is believed to be extremely rare in Peninsular Malaysia (Sebastian 1995) and reported from scattered localities in the Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Wright <em>et al. </em>2008).&#160;</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Hairy-nosed Otter is the rarest and least known among the five species of otters occurring in Asia. It is endemic to Southeast Asia. The type specimen came from Sumatra. Once believed to be extinct, the Hairy-nosed Otter has been rediscovered in many parts of Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Cambodia. Historically, it occurred from southern Indochina to Malaysia (Sebastian 1995) and Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1988, Kanchanasaka 2000). In Thailand it has been reported from Phru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forest (Kanchanasaka <em>et al.</em> 1998). From Viet Nam it has also been reported from U Minh Thuong Nature Reserve in Mekong Delta (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Nguyen 2005, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2007) and from Cambodia it has been reported from Tonle Sap wetlands and the coastal zones (Long 2000, Poole 2003, A. Olsson pers. comm. 2014). It has been reported from Malaysia at Terengganu in 2003 and from Muar in 1995. It has been recently reported in Sumatra, Indonesia (Lubis 2005, Latifiana and Pickles 2013).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Recently during a surveys of the wildlife trade in the town of Mong La, Shan State, Myanmar, three species of otters were observed, including a skin of a hairy-nosed otter. <span lang=""EN-US"">This observation constitutes the first record of Hairynosed Otter in trade in Myanmar<span lang=""EN-US""> (Shepherd and Nijman 2014).&#160;Historical records of its occurrence comes from the coast off of Penang Island (Harrison 1984), and from accidental road kill in Brunei in 1997 (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2009).

21937379,12304,Lontra longicaudis,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The recent increase in available information on the Neotropical Otter reveals this species to be Near Threatened in large portions of its range. Although critical data on aspects of its biology, demography and behaviour are still lacking for many areas, the effects of a large variety of anthropogenic threats such as pollution, gold mining, habitat loss on its population dynamics, while not rigorously estimated, are likely to be increasing. These threats will probably affect the population status and range of this species and it is suspected that it will undergo a decline of 25% in the next 27 years (three generations) (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). While the Neotropical Otter has a wide distribution range in Latin America, this does not mean that this species is free from local extinction risks. In contrast, we now have more recent data to support a change in the Red List status of this species. In several countries (Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Belize, Ecuador) this species has been identified as threatened in their regional and local Red Lists indicating its declining trend. In view of this we conclude that the Neotropical Otter should be listed as Near Threatened as it almost almost qualifies for a threatened category under criterion A3cd.","The Neotropical Otter occurs in a large variety of habitats from rocky shorelines to deciduous and evergreen forests, warm and cool climate rainforests, and coastal savanna swamps (Emmons 1990). Habitat requirements include good-quality riparian cover (Bertonatti and Parera 1994, Redford and Eisenberg 1992) and abundant potential den sites (Soldateli and Blacher 1996). It uses both fresh and saline environments.It occurs mostly from sea level to 1,500 m of altitude but has also been found up to 4,000 m in the Andean region (Eisenberg 1989, Emmons 1990, Melendres 1978, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Trujillo and Arcila 2006). In coastal portions of the species distribution, it has been registered as occurring below 300 m (Spinola and Vaughan 1995, Soutullo <em>et al</em>. 1999, Alarcon and Simões-Lopes 2003, Rheingantz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While sensitive to chemical and organic pollution, the species is found areas with high level of human influence such as agricultural and livestock activities (Bertonatti and Parera 1994, Macdonald and Mason 1992, Pardini and Trajano 1999, Rheingantz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>This otter is considered an opportunistic predator that mostly concentrates feeding efforts on selecting prey with slow escape ability (Pardini 1998, Quadros and Monteiro-Filho 2001, Rheingantz 2006). It feeds mainly on fish, with crustaceans, insects, amphibians and molluscs also contributing to its diet, although these additional items may be seasonal variations (Gallo 1986, Bardier 1992, Bertonatti and Parera 1994, Passamani and Camargo 1995, Soldateli and Blacher 1996, Helder-Jose and de Andrade 1997, Pardini 1998, Quadros and Monteiro-Filho 2001, Kasper <em>et al</em>. 2004, Casariego-Madorell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Carvalho-Junior <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rheingantz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fish consumed are mostly species of the Cichlidae, Anostomidae, Characidae, Loricariidae and Pimelodidae families (Passamani and Camargo 1995, Spinola and Vaughan 1995, Kasper <em>et a</em>l. 2004, Rheingantz <em>et al</em>. 2011), while crustacean are mainly crayfish and crabs (Casariego-Madorell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Rheingantz <em>et al</em>. 2012). Small mammals, birds and reptiles may be consumed opportunistically (Parera 1993, Bertonatti and Parera 1994, Passamani and Camargo 1995, Gallo-Reynoso 1996).<br/><br/>The Neotropical Otter appears not to compete with the larger sympatric species <em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em> (Carter and Rosas 1997, Duplaix 1980). <em>L. longicaudi</em>s tends to be more generalist in habitat requirements than <em>P. brasiliensis</em> (Muanis and Oliveira 2011). Anacondas (<em>Eunectes</em> sp.), Jaguars (<em>Panthera onca</em>) (Duplaix 1980, Parera 1996a), Black Caimans, domestic dogs, and larger birds of prey may also prey on this otter or its cubs (Dunstone and Strachan 1988, Parera 1996b).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs mostly during the dry or low water season, but it may occur throughout the year in certain localities (Parera 1996a). Gestation is estimated to be 56 days (Bertonatti and Parera 1994), and litter size varies from one to five cubs (Bertonatti and Parera 1994), with two or three on average (Parera 1996a).","It was extensively hunted for its pelt during 1950-1970, which resulted in its local extinction over parts of its former range (Brack-Egg 1978, Donadio 1978). Although current hunting pressures are virtually unknown, continued illegal hunting persists usually associated with local conflicts with fishermen (Chehebar 1991, González and Utrera, 2001, IBAMA 2001), which have been suggested to represent one of the most serious threats to this species. Additionally, the high level of habitat destruction by deforestation, mining, and water pollution are likely to contribute to the species rareness (Melendres 1978, Gallo 1986, Chehebar 1990, Alho and Blacher 1991, Alho <em>et al</em>. 1998, González and Utrera 2001) and may be responsible for population decline and isolation.<br/><br/>In Mexico and maybe in other regions, industrial waste spills into rivers have increased the amount of heavy metals, with a consequent increase in deaths of Neotropical Otters (Gallo-Reynoso 1997). Finally, otters killed on roads have been&#160; reported in the Guianas (Duplaix 2004), south and southeastern Brazil (and likely in other localities (C.S. Trinca, pers. obs.)), which may represent an additional threat to the species survival and can be associated to increasing levels of habitat fragmentation. It is a leading cause of death in Europe for<em> Lutra lutra</em>, for instance (e.g. in the Netherlands).","<p>This shy and elusive species is widely distributed, but rarely seen even in remote areas. However, in the Brazilian Pantanal it can be observed during the day. Recently, additional points of occurrence were registered, including the littoral zone of the Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil (Astúa <em>et al.</em> 2010), tropical and subtropical zones around Andes in the occidental portion of Ecuador, and the surrounding zones of the Colombian Andean mountains (Trujillo and Arcila 2006). Although the absence of detailed data on population size and densities for the whole distribution area is patchy, but in areas where surveys have been made, <em>Lontra longicaudis</em> is reported as decreasing (Trujillo and Arcila 2006).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Lontra longicaudis</em> occurs from northwestern Mexico to Uruguay (Gallo 1991), Paraguay (mammal book), and across the northern part of Argentina to Buenos Aires province (Chehebar 1990, Cockrum 1964, Redford and Eisenberg 1992). It is widespread in the northern and central parts of Argentina (Bertonatti and Parera 1994). The species occurs from sea level up to 4,000 m. (Muanis and Oliveira 2011). It is absent from a large portion of arid northeastern Brazil (Larivière 1999).","The species was severely hunted for the international fur trade until the 70s, when it was protected in a large portion of its range. It is included on Appendix I of the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES; Emmons, 1990). Cubs may be taken as pets locally but appear not to enter the commercial trade (Duplaix 2002).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<em>Lontra longicaudis</em> is listed in the Appendix I of CITES. It is also listed as Endangered by the United States Department of Interior. The Neotropical Otter is listed as a priority species by the Fundacion Vida Silvestre Argentina (Bertonetti and Parera 1994). This species is currently protected in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, French Guiana, Trinidad, Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela (Brack-Egg 1978, Mondolfi and Trebbau 1978, Chehebar 1990, Aranda 1991). Neotropical Otters are not legally protected in Guyana and Honduras, and no information is available on the distribution or legal status of Neotropical Otters in Belize, El Salvador, and Guatemala (Chehebar 1990). Although it is not included in the last Brazilian Red List Assessment, <em>L. longicaudis</em> is considered as Vulnerable in the Atlantic Forest biome (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is considered as Near Threatened in São Paulo (Bressan <em>et al</em>. 2009) and Paraná (Paraná 2010), and Vulnerable in the states of Minas Gerais (Biodiversitas 2005) and Rio Grande do Sul (Indrusiak and Eikirik 2003), and is included as almost threatened in the national assessment (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation priorities include the standardization of field survey techniques to map the current species’ range, the identification of key habitats, the protection of areas where large populations remain, and stricter regulations to prevent release of toxic waste in riverine systems (Mason and Macdonald 1990). The impact of road deaths should be evaluated in other parts of the species distribution.<br/><br/>The development of direct strategies for avoiding otter predation on fish farms is needed to decrease the conflict with humans by the supposed competition for fish.<br/><br/>Finally, local and regional scale studies need to be conducted in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding on demographic parameters such as population size, density, mating systems and dispersal patterns. Population genetic studies need also be performed across the species’ range in order to evaluate the level of genetic diversity and levels of populations connectivity, which will allow the definition of task areas and populations for management and conservation actions.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
21938042,12305,Lontra provocax,Endangered,A3cde,2015,2014-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is considered to be Endangered under criterion A3cde due to projected future population decline due to habitat loss. Accelerating habitat destruction and degradation throughout the Southern River Otter's range is the greatest threat to the species, and is projected (based on current trends) to lead to a future &gt;50% reduction in population size over the next 30 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) for those subpopulations using rivers and lakes (freshwater habitats). For the subpopulations using the southern fjords and islands (marine habitats) of Chile the population may reduce to 50% over the next 30 years due to the impacts of intensive fishery activities. The distribution of the Southern River Otter has declined drastically due to combined pressures from the destruction of habitat, removal of vegetation, river and stream canalization, and extensive dredging (<span lang=""EN-US"">Medina 1996,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Medina-Vogel <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). At present, poaching is a minor problem but still occurs particularly south of 43°S latitude where control of hunting is difficult to implement. Extirpation of the Southern River Otter began in local basins but has become widespread. The lack of re-establishment of the species is <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">probably due to high mortality or reproductive failure following the dispersal of otters into unsuitable areas (<span lang=""EN-US"">Medina 1996). This is resulting in a population that is becoming increasingly fragmented and more susceptible to local extinctions through habitat destruction, human disturbance, predation by domestic dogs, and demographic or environmental stochastic events. Genetic studies have confirmed a lower genetic diversity in the northern freshwater subpopulations in comparison to those from the south confirming a past bottleneck probably due to anthropogenic factors (<span lang=""EN-US"">Centron <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2011).</span></span></span></span></p>","<p>The Southern River Otter is distributed in the southern temperate forest of South America. This species presents a distribution associated with inland waters in the northern parts of its range, and marine habitat in the southern part of its range.

Other species of crustaceans, fish and amphibians are also in the otter’s diet but are of marginal occurrence. The otter use rivers with abundant vegetation (<span lang=""EN-US"">Chehebar <em>et al.</em> 1986,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2003) and inhabit diverse types of wetlands including Andean lakes, rivers of different sizes, ponds and estuaries. A study using telemetry described an average home range of 11.3 km, with solitary behaviour and a low spatial overlap between individuals of same sex suggesting intrasexual territoriality (<span lang=""EN-US"">Sepúlveda <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the marine range the species uses the marine rocky coast with abundant vegetation cover and low exposure to wind and waves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Sielfeld 1992,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). In this environment the Southern River Otter is sympatric with the Marine Otter (<em>L. felina</em>), but the later is segregated by its use of more wave-exposed coastal areas (<span lang=""EN-US"">Sielfeld 1992,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Ebensperger and Botto-Mahan 1997). The diet in the marine environment is composed of coastal fish of the genera <em>Harpagifer</em>, <em>Patagonotothen</em>, <em>Eleginops</em>, <em>Cottoperca</em> and crustaceans of the genera <em>Munida, Taliepus, Cancridae, Galatheidae, Lithodidae, Lithodes, Paralomis </em>and<em> Campylonotus&#160;</em>(<span lang=""EN-US"">Sielfeld and Castilla 1999,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2013). In general for both marine and inland waters the Southern River Otter seems to be a specialized aquatic bottom forager preying on slow benthic fish and crustaceans.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","The Southern River Otter habitat is very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments the high demand for water by human activities such agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003,&#160;Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996,&#160;Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Fasola <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Because most studies on this species have been made based on indirect signs of the species there are no estimates of the size of their subpopulations. The freshwater subpopulations have been studied more than those in marine environments. Monitoring of signs such as faeces or tracks has been implemented particularly for the population in Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina by the Administration of National Parks for over 30 years (Chehebar 1985, Chehebar <em>et al</em>. 1986, Chehébar and Porro 1998, Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pozzi and Chehebar 2013). A relatively stable otter distribution has been observed in this area with some marginal expansion outside the Nahuel Huapi Park in the Limay River (Carmanchahi <em>et al</em>. 2006). In this population recent volcanic activity during 2011 could have disrupted freshwater ecosystems and consequently affecting the otter population, but there are no studies on the subject, which are of utmost urgency.<br/><br/>Freshwater subpopulations have been described as fragmented and comprised of seven isolated subpopulations (Medina 1996) but subsequent surveys have identified presence in areas previously thought not to have otters (Rodríguez<em> et al</em>. 2008); it is not clear if this is the result of a recent recolonization or sampling bias in earlier studies, and more research is needed. A radiotelemetry study in the Queule River found densities of 0.25 otters/km of river (Sepúlveda<em> et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Studies of the marine population in Chile indicate that the otter distribution in this environment would be continuous and abundances estimated are 0.57 otters/km of coast (Sielfeld 1992). Studies based on indirect signs in marine populations in Argentina, indicate two separate subpopulations, one in Isla de Los Estados (Provincial Reserve) and the other in Bahia Lapataia, Tierra del Fuego National Park, in the Beagle Channel (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>During 1910-1954 a total of 38,263 otter pelts (<em>Lontra felina</em> and <em>L. provocax</em>) were exported from Chile but after that period no exports exist due to the implementation of different laws and international agreements (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986) .",Decreasing,"The Southern River Otter occurs in Chile and Argentina in freshwater and marine environments. The freshwater distribution is located in the northern part of the otter’s range and was historically wider in both countries. In Chile, river otters occurred from Cachapoal River (34ºS) (Gay 1847, Reed 1877) up to the Peninsula de Taitao (46ºS) with a continuous distribution in rivers and lakes (Medina 1996). The current distribution in Chile has been strongly restricted from north to south due to land use change and human colonization (Medina 1996), as a consequence, the otter populations are only found at present from the Imperial River (38ºS ) (Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011) to the south. In Argentina freshwater subpopulations were distributed historically from the Neuquen Province (36ºS) to the Lake Buenos Aires (46ºS) and mostly associated with water courses from the Andean Range and the steppe (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012). The present freshwater distribution in Argentina is mostly restricted to the Limay watershed, mainly within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (Chehebar 1985, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Southern River Otter subpopulations that inhabit marine environments are distributed along the Pacific coast of Chile from 46ºS to Tierra del Fuego in Chile (Cabrera 1957, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Argentina, marine subpopulations are present only in the Archipielago Fueguino in Los Estados Island and the Beagle Channel (Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2012, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). Marine river otters in Argentina are probably a continuous subpopulation of the main otter subpopulation in Chile (Sielfeld 1992).",The animals are hunted for their pelts which are used to make clothing.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The Southern River Otter is listed on CITES Appendix I and listed on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix I.<br/><br/>In Chile, the conservation status is listed by the Reglamento de Clasificación de Especies as Endangered in VI, VII, VIII, IX, XIV and X Districts and as Data Deficient in XI and XII Districts (Chile 2011).

In those populations inside official protected areas the Corporacion Nacional Forestal is responsible of their conservation. National Action plans in Chile are developed by the Minisiterio del MedioAmbiente, but despite it’s conservation status no Action Plan exists for this species at present, which is the most urgent conservation action priority. Hunting is prohibited since 1929 in Chile (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986) and the governmental agency responsible for hunting permits and enforcement is the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero.<br/><br/>In Argentina the conservation status is Endangered (EN A3cd) (Valenzuela et al. 2012). At national level, the governmental agency responsible of native wildlife conservation and management is the Secretaría de Ambiente y DesarrolloSustentable de la Nación through the Dirección de Fauna Silvestre. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is responsible of conservation of those populations inside the national protected areas, where the species is classified as Special Value Species (APN 1994.). The two populations in Argentina from freshwater and marine habitats are mostly inside national protected areas.<br/><br/>Because of the several agencies involved in the management of the species a strong coordination with clear responsibilities and a work agenda is a major urgency in the short term. Actions recommended for both Chile and Argentina are:<br/><ul><li>To develop a Conservation Bi-National Plan for the species;</li><li>To develop specific National Conservation Plans for each country;</li><li>To develop validated Monitoring Programmes in protected and unprotected lands;particularly in Chile where there is no such activity in any population; and</li><li>To reinforce the importance of environmental impact assessment projects in relation to the species in order to adequately determine: a) presence of otter population in areas of projects, and b) in those projects requiring to implement adequate actions to incorporate: 1) measures of monitoring, 2) mitigation and 3) compensation activities.</li></ul><br/>There have not been any reintroduction attempts, which could be an appropriate conservation action considering the success of such plans in North American and European species. Although otters are one of the most appealing species in zoo/aquarium exhibitions providing good opportunities for education and awareness about conservation issues in aquatic environments, no known individuals of the Southern River Otter are currently in captivity and there are no historical records for any captive animals.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Of the 12 national assessments on the distribution and conservation status of the Giant Otter that were prepared, in two countries the species has been categorized in national Red Lists as Critically Endangered (Paraguay and Ecuador), in four countries as Endangered (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia), and as Vulnerable in Brazil; it is considered Extinct in Uruguay, and probably Extinct in Argentina. In the Guianas, the Giant Otter is also protected by law though this is rarely enforced. There was a strong consensus among workers on Giant Otter that it should be considered as Endangered on a continental level. The total global Giant Otter population size is low but, more critically, individual subpopulations are fragmented and most are small. Because of its conspicuous behaviour and social nature, this species is easy to extirpate and is therefore extremely vulnerable. It remains highly susceptible to hunting (though currently hunting of Giant Otters is not a common practice). The killing of individuals and entire groups continues in some areas where fishermen are active, including in protected areas. Moreover, the Giant Otter is intrinsically vulnerable to extinction: combined with low habitat resilience and the fact that only a quarter to a third of the total population reproduces, the species also shows late maturity, late breeding age, suspected low transient survival, and low cub survival - all are traits which limit Giant Otter recovery and re-colonization. Although widely distributed on a continental scale, overall they may occupy less than 5%, often less than 1% of a given watershed. This means that changes in this specific habitat, or impacts there-in, will have severe effects even if only a fraction of the overall area is affected. Rivers are roads into the forest, this is where people settle, where gold mining takes place, where there is competition for fish or overfishing, where “green” energy can be harvested, where climate change will have strong impacts, where contamination can be spread rapidly, and so on. This vital link to rivers and wetlands renders the Giant Otter much more susceptible than most other comparable large predators of the Amazon, such as the Jaguar.<br/><br/>In South America, only 13 years from now (about half the time-span considered for this assessment) there will be an increase of 44 million people, much more than the total population of Peru. Brazil has seen the highest deforestation rate in the world. There are estimates that the Amazon rainforest will be reduced by 40% in 2030. If just one or two of the Giant Otter’s strongholds is affected, this may be enough to lead to heavy declines in overall population numbers. Further, once remote watersheds are now accessible so that Giant Otters can no longer retreat to ‘safe zones’.<br/><br/>Many emerging and/or growing threats pose serious problems for Giant Otters including contamination, overfishing and conflict with fishermen, and infrastructure such as roads and hydroelectric dams. With their preference for lowland wetlands, rivers, and lakes, their prime habitat overlaps completely with the demands of humans (gold mining, fishing, deforestation, mega infrastructure and energy developments, settlement, transport, tourism, etc.). The effects of climate change are already being felt, with Brazil recently suffering severe droughts. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon could reduce basin-wide rainfall by 12% during the wet season and by 21% in the dry season by 2050 (Spracklen <em>et al</em>. 2012) with unknown impacts on (semi) aquatic species.<br/><br/>In summary, three Giant Otter generation lengths approximately represent a 25 year period. Accelerating habitat destruction and degradation throughout the Giant Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, and is estimated to potentially lead to a future reduction in population size of 50% or more over the next 25 years, through a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and quality of habitat (subcriterion c), with pollutants (especially mercury and fossil fuels), pathogens (domestic animal diseases), and competitors (fishermen) (subcriterion e) potentially playing important roles. The species is confirmed to be Endangered.","The Giant Otter is known to inhabit large, slow-moving rivers, streams, lakes and swamps (Duplaix 1980, Carter and Rosas 1997). In a long-term study in Peru, Giant Otters were found in most of the river systems in the southeastern part of the country with the exception of those located close to the Andes where the flow gradient is steeper (Schenck 1999). Studies in Suriname have shown a preference for black water creeks and rivers with sandy or rocky bottoms (Duplaix 1980). Large rivers of lowland areas with gentle flow and oxbow lakes with high fish densities represent the environment most favoured by this species (Schenck 1999), and areas with gently-sloped riverbanks and dense, overhanging vegetation are preferred habitat features (Duplaix 1980). On occasion, Giant Otters are seen in agricultural canals, reservoirs of dams and drainage channels along roads (Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Giant Otters tend to concentrate in their preferred habitats and maintain territories that can be very small and stable year-round in lakes (105 ha for a group of 5-14 otters; Groenendijk and Hajek 2006), or may show considerable variation and be larger in river systems. Habitat requirements include: undisturbed, high banks for denning, sites for latrines, and abundant prey populations.<br/><br/>A typical Giant Otter subpopulation consists of family groups of 2-15 with well established territories, plus sexually mature transients. Family groups are composed of a dominant breeding pair, non-breeding subadults and offspring. Sometimes non-related subadults may be accepted by a group (Ribas 2011, Duplaix 2004) As a rule, each group produces a litter once a year, although two litters have been occasionally recorded. Gestation is around 64-77 days and litters range from 1-6 young (averaging 2) though it is rare to see litters greater than four in the wild (Duplaix 1980, Staib 2005, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Reproductive success is related to group size and habitat quality with smaller groups having lower success (Schenck 1999, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).<br/><br/>The Giant Otter diet consists almost exclusively of fish, up to four kilograms per day, although caiman and turtles may also occasionally be consumed (Staib 2005, Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). The feeding ecology of <em>P. brasiliensis</em> has been shown to be highly dependent upon the seasonal migrations of fish populations (Duplaix 1980).<br/><br/>Giant Otters attain sexual maturity at roughly 2.5 years of age (Sykes-Gatz 2005, Oliveria <em>et al</em>. 2011), but first breeding occurs on average two years later (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. unpublished). This, in tandem with high cub mortality (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. unpublished), suspected high transient mortality, and difficulty to establish new groups (Schenck <em>et al</em>. 2003), means that population recovery and colonization of new areas can be slow.","While in the past, hunting for pelts greatly impacted the Giant Otter population, currently the species is threatened by multiple anthropogenic influences arising from increased human settlement and activity throughout the species range. These result in modification and destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of aquatic ecosystems (especially due to gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers for monocultures), domestic animal diseases, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Groenendijk 1998, Schenck 1999, Utreras 2001, Utreras and Tirira 2011).<br/><br/>Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region (Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, Venezuela and northern Brazil) and in southeastern Peru. Its main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Mongabay.com). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high - now approaching US$1,800/oz. - and mercury is cheap. Peruvian mercury imports have risen 42% (2006-2009) to 130 t/yr, almost all of which is used directly in artisanal gold mining. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003-2006 (292 ha/yr) to 2006-2009 (1,915 ha/yr) (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Areas impacted by gold-mining have been shown to still have depleted fish populations and to not have been re-colonized by otters over a decade after mining stopped. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb <em>et al</em>. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish in the area of Manu National Park were higher than what is considered tolerable in the Eurasian Otter. However, the expected high concentrations of methylmercury in Giant Otter tissues have not been corroborated due to the difficulty of finding dead Giant Otters. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the miner’s area of influence.<br/><br/>One of the major future threats are the many planned hydroelectric dams within the region; these will change habitats and alter hydrological regimes of rivers downstream with resulting impacts on fish populations and habitat. There are plans for 151 new dams greater than two MW over the next 20 years (the time-span considered for this assessment is 24 years), more than a 300% increase. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Ecological impact analysis classified 47% of the potential new dams as high impact and just 19% as low impact. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. More than 80% would drive deforestation due to new roads, transmission lines, or inundation (Finer and Jenkins 2012). Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes such as the shallow Balbina Lake (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2007 but the population level impact of these projects is unknown. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (IIRSA) (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Molecular research suggests that the Giant Otter populations of the Madre de Dios drainage have a distinct evolutionary history and consequently represents an evolutionary unit, an important segment of the species’ total genetic diversity (Pickles <em>et al</em>. 2011). The current and projected high level of threat facing this population together with its intrinsic importance in safeguarding the evolutionary potential of the species make it of high conservation concern.Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. With increasing tourism in South America it has proved important to control tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Schenck and Staib 2000, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Monitoring of Giant Otter and tourist groups before and after implementation of management zoning has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists on unmanaged lakes is considerably lower than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).<br/><br/>Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases could pose a serious threat to wild giant otter populations. Infection could also occur in remote areas since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of immunologically naive populations (Schenck <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>Human/Giant Otter conflict is emerging as an increasingly important problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local consumption and in commercial and sport fishing (Gómez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte <em>et al</em>. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2011, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Additionally, Giant Otters are sometimes blamed for damage to fishing nets and traps (Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fish-farming is rapidly increasing within the species’ range and may prove to be a source of conflict and habitat degradation in the future. Giant Otters occasionally become trapped in fishing nets and drown. Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to keep as pets.<br/><br/>Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, easily visible, very social, and vocal. They are diurnal and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their sign – latrines and dens - is easily recognizable and often visible, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the years of the pelt trade, these life history attributes of the species combined to make it extremely vulnerable, and today may cause it to be an easy target for fishermen as was documented recently on two different rivers in southeastern Peru (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012), and in the Sustainable Development Reserve Uacari, in Brazil (Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2011) where 21 Giant Otters were killed over an undefined period between 2006 and 2006 (M. Marmontel and Lima pers. comms.). In 2011-2012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Território Indigena Kanamari, adjacent to the SDR Uacari), based on their perception that the species is overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges and distributed these amongst other hunters; 64 Giant Otters were shot (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can contribute significantly to the extinction of small subpopulations in a watershed.<br/><br/>It seems likely that mining activities and the widespread conversion of forest into agricultural and pasture lands will continue unabated in the near future as part of the economic development of the Amazonian countries. Brazil, which represents roughly three quarters of the Giant Otter’s current distribution range, merits greater consideration. As stated earlier, Giant Otter populations of the Pantanal appear to be recovering, with signs of reaching carrying capacity in some areas (Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Populations are stable and possibly recovering in some parts of the Amazon (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, the human population is increasing and expanding simultaneously and the Amazon region registered the highest population growth of the whole country in the last census (IBGE 2010). As a consequence, we can expect colonization of new regions, intensive exploitation of natural resources, destruction of forests, reduction of water quality, and overfishing. Furthermore, the proposed mega-projects included in the Growth Acceleration Plan (PAC) as well as the recently approved federal law, represent a significant threat to Amazonian diversity.","<p>There is no current total population estimate and current population trends are unknown: however, there is evidence that populations may be recovering in northern Peru (Recharte and Bodmer 2009, Deza pers. comm. 2012), the northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon (Utreras pers. comm. 2012) and the Pantanal (Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012) though in other regions, such as in the Department of Madre de Dios in southeastern Peru (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012) and in western Colombia (J.C. Botello pers. comm. 2012) populations are on the decline due to habitat loss and degradation, and other human activities. Most populations remain isolated from each other.</p>  <p>Population estimates based on surveys exist for only a few areas: Brazilian Pantanal: 2,000-5,000 individuals (Tomas pers. comm. 2012); Madre de Dios, southeastern Peru: 180-400 individuals (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012); Cantao State Park, Brazil: 31 individuals (Campello pers. comm. 2012); Amana, Brazil: 75 individuals (M. Marmontel pers. comm. 2012); Balbina Lake, Brazil: at least 130 animals (F.

Pickles pers. comm. 2011). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em> is endemic to South America and is distributed east of the Andes in the Orinoco, Amazonas, and Parana basins, and the hydrographic networks of the Guianas. The northern limit of its distribution range occurs in northern Venezuela, and the southern limit in Misiones, Argentina. The Giant Otter’s range has become discontinuous and fragmented due to local extinctions; the Uruguayan and Argentine populations are extinct or nearly so (Gil pers. comm., Buschiazzo pers. comm.), and the species is reduced to a single, small subpopulation in Paraguay, occupying less than 2% of its former distributional range. It is also extinct to the east of the Tocantins and Parana basins in Brazil and only relict subpopulations persist in the upper Parana River above Itaipu lake. Important subpopulations are still found in parts of the Amazon, in the Pantanal region, and, possibly, in the Guianas.","Hunting for the pelt trade was the single, greatest threat to the giant otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazil (Duplaix 1980). The inclusion of the Giant Otter on Appendix I of CITES in 1973, and the coming into force of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended the economic benefits of Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2009) and commercial hunting ceased shortly after. There is no current trade, although there have been reports of skins being displayed in homes as decoration (M. Marmontel &#160;and Lima pers. comms. 2012).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The Giant Otter is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as Endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act.

21938767,1793,Aonyx capensis,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-06-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although this species has a large distribution they are restricted to areas of permanent fresh water, offering good shoreline cover and an abundant prey base. Thus while the distribution range is large the spatial size of their occupied habitats is much smaller and unknown, particularly due to the widespread habitat destruction and pollution problems reported for much of the African continent. The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. Both this decrease in suitable habitat and increase in human/otter conflict are currently occurring and will certainly increase over the next three generations (13 years).<br/><br/>This reassessment is based on a perceived (in regions where studies have been conducted) (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005, Somers and Nel 2013) and assumed (in regions where no studies have been done) population decline over the last 18 years and beyond. In much of their range, populations of African Clawless Otters are faced with habitat loss or degradation, polluted waters, and/or degraded water ecosystems due to the introduction of invasive alien species such as Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>) and marginal agricultural practices. This habitat disturbance is exacerbated by poor sanitation infrastructure and growing industrial waste pollution. Additionally regional human populations are poor and increasingly placing pressure on all resources including water, vegetation, the otter prey base, as well as reducing suitable resting and denning sites vital to survival of the species.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons and the lack of effective conservation measures currently in place, the African Clawless Otter population is projected to decline by at least 20% in the next three generations (13 years based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species is therefore uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened&#160; as it almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A2cde+3cde.","African Clawless Otters are predominantly aquatic and seldom found far from water. Freshwater is an essential habitat requirement, and they only occur in marine habitats where there is access to fresh water. In marine habitats, rocky shores are preferred (Van Niekerk <em>et al</em>. 1998). Elsewhere, they are found in diverse habitats, from impoundments, estuaries, and mangroves to desert conditions of the upper Doring River in the Western Cape (South Africa) and the Fish River in southern Namibia (Nel and Somers 2007, Somers and Nel 2013); they are also found in many seasonal or episodic rivers in the Karoo (South Africa), such as the Sak, Vis, Riet and Gamka Rivers, provided suitable-sized pools persist (Nel and Somers 2007, Somers and Nel 2013). They have been recorded up to 3,000 m in Ethiopia (Yalden <em>et al</em>. 1996). In Nigeria the African Clawless Otters is mainly restricted to brackish water streams (with mangrove vegetation along the banks) and, more occasionally, to transitional habitats between freshwater and brackish‐water environments (Angelici <em>et al</em>. 2005). African Clawless Otters have been found in towns and cities, and can occupy rivers with high pollution and eutrophication levels (Somers and Nel 2013).<br/><br/>The home range of the African Clawless Otters range length varied from 4.9 to 54.1 km and core length from 0.2 to 9.8 km. Total area of water used varied between 4.9 and 1062.5 ha, and core areas from 1.1 to 138.9 ha. As predicted using the resource dispersion hypothesis, total home-range length was correlated with mean reed bed (high food density patch) nearest neighbour distance. The pattern of home-range use by females was suggestive of territoriality. Male African Clawless Otters had overlapping home ranges, both with other males and with females (Somers and Nel 2000).<br/><br/>The African Clawless Otters prefer hunting at depths of 0.5–1.5 m. This is despite having a higher hunting success, catching larger, more energy-rich prey (fish), and shortest time foraging per catch, at depths of 1.5–2.5 m. Some of the data presented support the optimal breathing hypothesis, which predicts that both surface and dive times should increase for dives of greater depths. However, diving efficiency does not decrease with increasing depth, and percentage time at the surface does not increase with increasing depth. These are contrary to the optimal breathing hypothesis (Somers and Nel 2000).","The main threat to the species is the declining state of freshwater ecosystems in Africa. For instance in South Africa the state of main river ecosystems is very poor: 84% of the ecosystems are threatened, with 54% Critically Endangered, 18% Endangered, and 12% Vulnerable (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Otter habitat has been either drastically changed or lost, following bush clearing, deforestation, overgrazing, siltation, draining of wetlands or water extraction or denudation of riparian vegetation (Rowe-Rowe 1995, Nel and Somers 1998).<br/><br/>In parts of their range, African Clawless Otters getting killed for skins and other body parts (e.g., Cunningham and Zondi 1991, De Luca and Mpunga 2005), or because they are regarded as competitors for food, particularly in rural areas where fishing is an important source of income, or where they are believed to be responsible for poultry losses (Rowe-Rowe 1995), and damage to young maize plants (Reed-Smith pers. comm.). Fisheries managers of the Kairezi River Protected Area in Zimbabwe blamed trout declines on otter predation and competition with trout for food, even though scat analysis revealed that only 1% of otter faeces contained the remains of trout and their diets overlapped only 17% (Butler 1994, Butler and Marshall 1996). Occasionally, they are accidentally caught and drowned in gill nets and fish traps (Rowe-Rowe 1990).","<p>African Clawless Otters populations are thought to be decreasing throughout most of their range based on assessed threats and decreasing reports of signs or sightings; however, there is a lack of research-based population status information over the last 15 years outside of South Africa. Density estimates from various studies in southern Africa are summarized by Somers and Nel (2013).</p>",Decreasing,"The African Clawless Otter is the most widely distributed otter species in Africa, with a range stretching from Senegal and Mali throughout most of West Africa to Sudan and Ethiopia, and then southwards throughout East Africa to the Western Cape of South Africa.

21939068,44166,Aonyx cinereus,Vulnerable,A2acde,2015,2014-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is confirmed to be Vulnerable under criterion A2acde due to an inferred past population decline because of habitat loss and exploitation. In the last few decades, the range of Asian Small-clawed Otter has shrunk particularly in its western portion, as evident from the published literature. Given the extent of loss of habitat that is occurring in south and southeast Asia and the intensity of poaching the reduction in population has been observed in many parts of its range including India (Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Meena 2001, Hussain 2002, Gonzalez 2010, Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is believed to be either extirpated or extremely rare throughout much of its range in southern China (Foster-Turley and Santiapillai 1990). The threats to Small-clawed Otter are prominent in its western range so much so that over the last 60 years its range has shrunk considerably moving west to east from Himachal Pradesh to Assam (Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2011). Likewise in Indochina, the range of the species is shrinking, and hunting appears to play a major role in its rapid decline in the eastern end of its global range. Although quantitative data on population sizes or trends are lacking, it is inferred that the global population of the Asian Small-clawed Otter has declined by &gt;30% over the past 30 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The typical habitats of the Asian Small-clawed Otter in west Java are wetland systems having pools and stagnant water, including shallow stretches, with depth less than 1 m. These habitats are represented by freshwater swamps, meandering rivers, mangroves and tidal pools. Muller (1839) observed Small-clawed Otter from slow-flowing lowland streams to submontane streams dominated by rocks and boulders in forested areas. Irrigated rice fields with many crab species (<em>Brachyura</em>) are extensively used by Small-clawed Otter  if proper shelter for them is available. These can act as suitable man made habitats (Melisch <em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). In Thailand, the rapid-flowing upper areas of the Huay Kha Khaeng are dominated by <em>Lutra lutra</em>, the slowly meandering river near the dam and the dam itself were used by <em>Lutrogale perspicillata</em> while the Asian Small-clawed Otter  occurred mostly in the middle sections, but also at the upper reaches. When different otter species occurred in the same site there was evidence of difference in use of the habitats. Signs of the of Small-clawed Otter  were found wandering further away from the river than the two other species, between patches of reeds and river debris where crabs were more likely to be found (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>In west Java, its presence is positively correlated with slow flowing and stagnant broad rivers and smaller streams, depicting a distinct decline in preference from slow to deep-water bodies. On the other hand, they also use shallow fast-flowing mountain creeks narrower than 5 m, particularly when the course of the streams includes natural pools. In rice fields, they chose slow-flowing irrigation channels narrower than 2 m and with a varied, moderate or low vegetation structure. Like Smooth-coated Otter the Asian Small-clawed Otter  dislike bare and open areas that do not offer any shelter (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). It prefers pond areas and rice fields than the rivers, whereas it uses mangroves and lakes in proportion to their availability (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In riverine systems it prefers moderate and low vegetation structure, though their presence was also observed from banks with poor vegetation cover. Neither in ponds nor in rice field areas did they show preference for any of the vegetation structure categories, though poor nor bare structural conditions were the least favoured both in riverine and pond areas and along the rice fields.<br/><br/>The Small-clawed Otter  is adapted to feed on invertebrates as evident from the last two upper teeth (pm4 and m3) which are larger in size for crushing the exoskeleton of crabs and other hard shelled prey. The Small-clawed Otter  feeds mainly on crabs, snails and other molluscs, insects and small fish such as gouramis and catfish (Pocock 1941, Wayre 1978). They supplement their diet with rodents, snakes and amphibians too. <br/><br/>During a study in Malaysia, Foster-Turley (1992) examined 328 scats and found that around 80.8% of the scats consisted of crabs, 77.8% fish, 12.5% insects and 4.0% snails. This is the first study in which quantitative information on the diet of wild small-clawed otter was made. This study revealed that though the small-clawed otter is adapted for an invertebrate diet it substantiates its diet with large quantity of fish. Apart from crabs, the major prey item for small-clawed otter was the mudskipper (<em>Gobioidei</em>). This was recorded in the 48% of the scats. The other important prey was <em>Trichogaster spp</em>. and <em>Anabantidae</em> fish, which were represented in 27.4% scats. As evident from the scats the major fish prey were <em>Trichogaster spp</em> 20.7%, <em>Anabis testudineus</em> 5.2%, <em>Clarius spp </em>2.4% and <em>Channa striatus</em> 1.5%. Apart from these the small-clawed otter in Malaysia also fed on snakes, frogs and insects. Foster-Turley (1992) also examined the diet composition at four different times of the year coinciding with different water levels in the rice fields and concluded that the diet of the small-clawed otter was significantly different at different times of the year. Only the relatively rare dietary components of rodents, snails and snakehead fish (<em>Clarius spp.</em>) showed no significant difference among seasons. Crabs were always the most prevalent food items, but the frequency of occurrence in scats varied from 70.4% to 93.2%. Similarly, though the mudskippers were the second most important food items, they were consumed in significantly different amounts in different seasons from a low of 27.3% to 63.6%. The amount of <em>Trichogaster</em>, <em>Anabis </em>and the <em>Anbantidae </em>also varied considerably. This difference in the use of these prey are most likely due to difference in the life cycle and availability of these prey at different times of the year.<br/><br/>Preliminary analysis of the small-clawed otter spraints from west Java showed their preference for crabs in both natural and man-made habitats (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). In 87% of all collected spraints, crabs formed the dominant prey. Remaining part of the spraints consisted of fish bones and scales, ribs and vertebrae, unidentified mammalian hair, shrimps, insects and snake scales.In the Huay Kha Khaeng, Thailand almost 90% of the spraints of small-clawed otter contained remains of crabs <em>Potamon smithianus</em>, whereas 5% scats contained each of Fish and Amphibians. Apart from this, in few scats evidences of rodents and other arthropods were also found. Kruuk <em>et al</em>. (1994) estimated the preference for various size classes of crabs eaten by small-clawed otter. Of the 92 scats, 14 scats had crabs size 10-14 cm, 42 scats had 15-19 cm, 26 had 20-24 cm, 12 had 25-29 cm, 4 had 30-34 and 1 had 40-44 cm. The size distribution of crabs taken by small-clawed otter was similar to what was available, and there was not much evidence for selection of specific size. In west Java a preliminary estimate of preferred size confirmed an average of 3-4 cm carapace width (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). <br/><br/>The sexual behaviour of small clawed otter has been observed in as young as 18 months old. In captivity, successful breeding has been reported for 2.1 year females and 2.8 year males. The youngest animal to reproduce was a female of 13 months captive born at Bronx Zoo, and the oldest was a 15 years male at the National Zoo, USA (Foster-Turley and Engfer 1988). In the females oestrous cycle has duration of anywhere from 28 to 30 days, with breeding occurring the year round (Lancaster 1975). Some facilities report this cycle extending to ""every few months"" with older animals. Oestrus lasts from one to thirteen days.  Behavioural signs of the onset of oestrus may include increased rubbing and marking. <br/><br/>In captivity mating usually takes place in the water, but has also been observed on land on a few occasions. In most cases the exact gestation period could not be ascertained but it is believed to be around 60-86 days (Lancaster 1975, Sobel 1996). The litter size ranges from 2-7. Life span in captivity is around 11 years (Crandall 1964).","The threat to Small-clawed Otter is similar to that of Smooth-coated and Eurasian otters. Throughout Asia the potential threat to its continued survival is destruction of its habitats due to changing land use pattern in the form of developmental activities. In many parts of Asia, the habitats have been reduced due to reclamation of peat swamp forests and mangroves, aquaculture activities along the intertidal wetlands and loss of hill streams. In India the primary threats are loss of habitats due to tea and coffee plantations along the hills, in the coastal areas loss of mangroves due to aquaculture and increased human settlements and siltation of smaller hill streams due to deforestation. Increased influx of pesticides into the streams from the plantations reduces the quality of the habitats. The threat posed by poaching is still very significant in many parts of India, and SE Asia and will certainly count as a major threat that needs to be constantly monitored. Poaching for pelt has been reported from across the Western Ghats in south India (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Another important threat to Asian Small-clawed Otter is reduction in prey biomass due to over-exploitation, which make its remaining habitats unsustainable. Pollution is probably the single most important factor causing decline in the population of many fish species (Dehadrai and Ponniah 1997). Reduction in prey biomass affects otter population, and organochloric and heavy metal contamination interferes with their normal physiology leading to the decline in population. The threats to Small-clawed Otter is prominent in its western range so much so that since last 60 years its range has shrunk considerable moving west to east from Himachal Pradesh to Assam (Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2011).","In most of their range the Asian Small-clawed Otter is sympatric with Smooth-coated and Eurasian otters. In India, all three species occur in the Western Ghats and in northeast India where the species occur in small group of two to four individuals. In the Western Ghats they are mostly found along the hill streams. They were once common in the mangroves of east Calcutta and Sunderbans (Sanyal 1991). The Asian Small-clawed Otters occur in freshwater and peat swamp forests, rice fields, lakes, streams, reservoirs, canals, mangrove and along the coast (Sivasothi and Nor 1994). In Malaysia and Indonesia they occur in coastal wetlands, and along the banks of paddy fields. Comparable data from Java, Myanmar, and India revealed that the Asian Small-clawed Otters have a high climatic and trophic adaptability in south and southeast Asian tropics, occurring from coastal wetlands up to mountain streams (Melisch <em>et al.</em>1996). A reliable population estimate of the Asian Small-clawed Otter is lacking. As many as 15 individuals were seen in a group in Malaysia (Wayre 1978), four to eight in coastal Sabah (Mason and Macdonald 1986) and two to four in India. In south China and Cambodia the population seems to be very small and declining.",Decreasing,"<p>The Asian Small-clawed Otter has a large distribution range, extending from India in South Asia eastwards through Southeast Asia to Palawan (Philippines), Taiwan and southern China (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Wozencraft 1993, Hussain 2000, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). In India it occurs in West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh as well as in southern Indian hill ranges of Coorg (Karnataka), Ashambu, Nilgiri and Palni hills (Tamil Nadu) and some places in Kerala (Pocock 1941, Prater 1971, Hussain 2000, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). It used to occur in the Western Himalayan foothills (Himachal Pradesh) but recent surveys have not found its evidence (Hussain 2002, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). Its presence has recently been confirmed from several survey sites in Odisha in eastern India (Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2014). In recent years, it has established itself in the wild in England after escaping from captivity (Jefferies 1990, 1991).</p>",For information on Use see Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Since 1977, The Asian Small-clawed Otter has been listed on CITES Appendix II which indicates that the species is not necessarily threatened with extinction, but the trade on its pelt must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival. However, most range countries are not able to control the clandestine trade leading to extensive poaching. Nevertheless, it is a protected species in almost all the range countries which prohibits its killing. The Asian Small-clawed Otter was once common in the streams and wetlands of south and Southeast Asia but is now restricted to a few protected areas. Creation of networks of Protected Areas, identification of sites as wetlands of national and international importance under the Ramsar Convention has to some extent halted the degradation of its habitat.<br/><br/>Over the years the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group has developed a cadre of biologists across Asia to conduct field surveys and to popularise otter conservation by promoting otters as ambassadors of the wetlands. However, concerted efforts to conserve this species are needed. For the long term survival of the species, policy based action, research on factors affecting its survival, habitat based action on creation and where required expansion of protected areas and communication and awareness building actions are needed.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The species is believed to have undergone a decline exceeding 50% over the past 45 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The world-wide population of Sea Otters decreased to approximately 2,000 animals by the end of the commercial fur trade in 1911 (Kenyon 1969). The population recovered from 11 remnant subpopulations located in Russia (Bering Island, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Kuril Islands) and in the United States (in Alaska (Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak archipelago, and Prince William Sound) and California). The remnant subpopulations were small and widely dispersed, as a result, this species has low genetic diversity (Ralls <em>et al</em>. 1983). Since the 1980s, the species had been recovering in many areas thanks to intensive management and regulatory efforts by several governments. However contemporary issues (oil spills, potential fisheries interactions, predation, and disease events), have either prevented Sea Otter populations from thriving or have caused population declines throughout much of the species range. In the United States, two subspecies of Sea Otters are listed as threatened (<em>E. lutris kenyoni</em> in SW Alaska and <em>E. lutris nereis</em> in California) due to precipitous population declines in Alaska and slow growth (and vulnerability to anthropogenic factors) of a small subpopulation in California.<br/><br/>In Alaska, precipitous population declines occurred in the Aleutian Islands beginning in the late 1980s-2005. By 2000, counts of Sea Otters had decreased by 90% with a declining trend through 2005 (Doroff <em>et al</em>. 2003, Estes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Burn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The probable cause of the decline was increased predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Estes <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; More recent Sea Otter surveys indicate the population trend has increased since 2005, however, counts remain well below carrying capacity for this region (D. Burn pers. comm. 2010). Population counts also remain low for the Alaska Peninsula (Burn and Doroff 2005, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Stock Assessment Reports). The subpopulation in the Kodiak archipelago and lower Cook Inlet appeared stable or increasing during the same period that population declines were documented in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska Peninsula (Kodiak and lower Cook Inlet are part of the Southwest population stock), however, this habitat has not been surveyed since 2004.<br/><br/>Recent studies have found infectious disease to be an important mortality factor in the California Sea Otter subpopulation (Conrad <em>et al</em>. 2005, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Information collected from forensic-level necropsies of dead Sea Otters and sampling of free-ranging Sea Otters indicate a strong link to protozoan parasites, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> and <em>Sacrocystis neurona</em>, that are known to breed in cats and opossums (Thomas and Cole 1996, Conrad <em>et al</em>. 2005) thus sources of mortality for the Sea Otter population include land-based factors. Other factors identified as causing significant mortality include acanthocephalan peritonitis, protozoal encephalitis, bacterial and fungal infections (Thomas and Cole 1996).<br/><br/>We have more population information from Russian now than in previous assessments. The number of Sea Otters along the Commander Islands reached maximum since last 150 years period (A. Burdin and Zagrebelny pers. comms. 2006). In 2007, the direct count revealed around 8,000 otters in both Bering and Medny Islands. The Commanders Island subpopulation of Sea Otter was never so abundant, but in 2008, it was found that the population was in decline and more recent estimates indicate the population to be 5,500. In 2004 the Kuril Islands subpopulation of Sea Otter was estimated around 19,000 (Kornev and Korneva 2006), but later counts have shown severe declines (up to 40-50% in different locations). Though the causes of these declines are not very clear, the threat due to poaching can’t be ruled out.<p></p>","Throughout their range, Sea Otters use a variety of near shore marine environments and 84% of foraging occurs in water ≤ 30m in depth (Bodkin <em>et al</em>. 2004) and throughout much of their range, foraging occurs within a kilometre of the shore. Their classic association is with rocky substrates supporting kelp beds, but they also frequent soft-sediment areas where kelp is absent (Riedman and Estes 1990, DeMaster <em>et al</em>. 1996, Burn and Doroff 2005). Kelp canopy is an important habitat component, used for foraging and resting (Riedman and Estes 1990). They are found most often in areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live in areas where the sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometres long, and remain there year-round. Sea Otters forage in rocky and soft-sediment communities on or near the ocean floor. The maximum confirmed depth of dive was 97 m (Newby 1975); however, recent studies using time-depth recorders implanted in Sea Otters indicate average maximum forage depths of 54 m for female and 82 m for male sea otters (Bodkin <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Sea Otters are weakly territorial (Kenyon 1969) with fighting and aggression rare (Loughlin 1980). Only adult male Sea Otters establish territories. Males patrol territorial boundaries and attempt to exclude other adult males from the area. Females move freely between and among male territories. Groups of male and female sea otters generally rest separately. Sea Otter annual home ranges can occupy up to 0.8 km² (80 ha) and extend along 16 km of coastline (Kenyon 1969, Loughlin 1980). Typically, female Sea Otter home ranges are about 1.5-2 times larger than resident adult males during the breeding season; however, females have smaller annual or lifetime home ranges than males (Riedman and Estes 1990). Jameson (1989) found that territorial adult males occupied a mean home range of 40.3 ha during the summer-fall period (when home range size was considered equal to territory size); and mean coastline length was 1.1 km. Winter-spring mean home range size of territorial adult males that remained in female areas was 78.0 ha, with a mean coastline length of 2.16 km.<br/><br/>The diet of Sea Otter consists almost exclusively of marine invertebrates, including sea urchins, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, abalone, other molluscs, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets crabs and giant octopuses (Estes 1980). Sea urchins, abalones and rock crabs are the principal prey of Sea Otters in newly reoccupied habitats of central California (Vandevere 1969) whereas clams and crab will make up the diet in soft-sediment habitats (Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992, Doroff and DeGange 1994). Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type (Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992). In California, it has been noted that Sea Otters ignore Pismo Clams smaller than three inches (7 cm) across. Only in the Aleutian archipelago were Sea Otters observed to regularly eat fish, which could comprise up to 50% of their diet. The fish species eaten were usually bottom dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as the Red Irish Lord and Globefish (Estes 1980). They also consume crab, clam, mussels, turban snails, sea cucumbers, squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, large barnacles, scallops, and sea stars (Wild and Ames 1974, Riedman and Estes 1990). Bivalve molluscs are excavated by digging in sand or mud bottoms and are the most common prey in soft-sediment communities (Calkins 1978, Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992, Doroff and DeGange 1994).<br/><br/>Male Sea Otters reach sexual maturity around age five or six, but probably do not become territorial or reproductively successful for two or three subsequent years (Riedman and Estes 1990). Most female Sea Otters are sexually mature at age four or five though some are mature as early as 2.5 years (Kenyon 1969, Jameson and Johnson 1993, Monson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Monson and DeGange 1995, von Biela 2007). Sea otters apparently are polygynous, although the exact nature of the mating system may vary. Females normally give birth to a single pup that weighs 1.4 to 2.3 kg at birth (Riedman and Estes 1990). Twinning has been documented in Sea Otters (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1980); however, litters larger than one are rare, and when they occur, neither pup is likely to survive (Jameson and Bodkin 1986). Pups remain dependent upon their mothers for about six months (Jameson and Johnson 1993). Longevity in Sea Otters is estimated to be 15 to 20 years for females and 10 to 15 years for males (Riedman and Estes 1990).","Oil spills are the greatest anthropogenic threat to Sea Otter (Geraci and Williams 1990). Sea Otters become hypothermic when oiled because oiled Sea Otter fur loses its insulative property and Sea Otters have no blubber layer, oil can be ingested while grooming, leading to gastrointestinal disorders, other ailments and death and volatile components of oil inhaled by Sea Otters can cause lung damage. Estimates of Sea Otter mortality following the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound ranged from 2,650 (Garrott <em>et al</em>. 1993) to 3,905 (DeGange <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Significant numbers of Sea Otters drowned in gill and trammel nets in California from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (Estes 1990). Recent population declines in California’s Sea Otters may be incidental to summer commercial fisheries. Estes <em>et al</em>. (2003) found that Sea Otter mortality was elevated in the summer months and that commercial fin fish landings in the coastal live trap fishery increased. Recent analyses indicated annual Sea Otter carcass recoveries and reported fishery landings were significantly correlated.<br/><br/>Thomas and Cole (1996) found 10% of southern Sea Otters they examined to be emaciated without specific cause of mortality. Severe weather and periodic climatic events such as El Niño can disrupt foraging behaviour and food availability, and increase pup loss. Under these circumstances, sea otters may find it difficult to meet their high metabolic needs, leading to malnutrition or starvation. Serious tooth wear in older sea otters may also contribute to mortality (Riedman and Estes 1990). Recent studies have found infectious disease to be an important mortality factor in California Sea Otter populations. Around 280 Sea Otters found dead have been linked “to a pair of protozoan parasites, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> and <em>Sacrocystis neurona</em>, that are known to breed in cats and opossums (Conrad <em>et al</em>. 2005, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Alaska, Streptococcal endocarditis, encephalitis and/or septicaemia, referred to as Strep. syndrome has been identified in forensic-level necropies of northern Sea Otters (Unusual Mortality Event Working Group) as well as trauma from boat strikes.&#160; Goldstein <em>et al</em>. (2009) found northern Sea Otters from the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak and Kachemak Bay area infected with phocine distemper.<br/><br/>Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), Great White Sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>), Bald Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>), Coyotes (<em></em><em>Canis latrans</em>), and Brown Bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) have been documented as predators of Sea Otters (Riedman and Estes 1990). Predation by Killer Whales is one factor that is believed to have caused Sea Otter population declines across the Western Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Doroff <em>et al</em>. 2003, Estes <em>et al</em>. 1998, Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 1998). Significant declines in preferred prey species populations - Northern Fur Seals (<em>Callorhinus ursinus</em>), Harbour Seals (<em>Phoca vitulina</em>), and Steller Sea Lions (<em>Eumetopias jubatus</em>) are believed to have caused Killer Whales to prey switch and consume Sea Otters (Estes <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Other potential threats to Sea Otters come under the climate change umbrella and include: ocean acidification in the north Pacific, pathogen transport, marine invasive species, biotoxins sequestered&#160; in bivalve prey, and frequency and intensity of storm events.","In the early 1700s, the worldwide population was estimated to be between 150,000 (Kenyon 1969) and 300,000 individuals (Johnson 1982), occurring along the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central Baja Peninsula in Mexico. Its abundance was greatly reduced by human exploitation. Although it appears that harvests periodically led to local reductions of sea otters (Simenstad <em>et al</em>. 1978), the species remained abundant throughout its range until the mid-1700s. Following the arrival in Alaska of Russian explorers in 1741, extensive commercial harvest of Sea Otters over the next 150 years resulted in the near extirpation of the species. When Sea Otters were afforded protection by the International Fur Seal Treaty in 1911, probably fewer than 2,000 animals remained in 13 remnant colonies (Kenyon 1969): two in the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka; one in the Commander Islands; a total of 10 in the following areas: Aleutian Islands (2) and along the Alaska Peninsula (3); Kodiak Island (1), Prince William Sound (1), the Queen Charlotte Islands (1), central California (1), and San Benito Islands (1). However, the Queen Charlotte, Canada and San Benito Island, Mexico remnant Sea Otter subpopulations have died out and likely did not contribute to the recolonization of the species following near extirpation (Kenyon 1969).<br/><br/>Sea Otters currently have established populations in parts of the Russian east coast, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California, and there have been reports of single-animal observations in Mexico and Japan. Population estimates made between 2004 and 2012 give a worldwide total of approximately 125,831 Sea Otters. In Russia, the most recent population estimates are from 2004 at which time reported counts were about 19,000 are in the Kurils, 3,500 on the Kamchatka Peninsula and another 5,500 on the Commander Islands.&#160; The Sea Otter population in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 individuals in 1973. In 2013, the estimated population is 89,073 animals in Alaska. In southwest Alaska, the population stock is listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and a strategic stock under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). There are low densities of Sea Otters from Castle Cape (south Alaska Peninsula) to Attu Island (Aleutian Island chain) and the population no longer functions as a key stone species in the habitat.&#160; Moderate densities are found from Castle Cape to Kamishak Bay (inclusive of the Kodiak Archipelago) and numbers are stable or slightly increasing.&#160; There is no evidence of further population decline but also no evidence of recovery. In south-central Alaska, the Sea Otter population stock is not a strategic stock under MMPA. Overall the population in this region is stable or slightly increasing. During 2012-2017, the federal government is soliciting an oil and gas lease sale that may impact the SW &amp; SC population stocks. In southeast Alaska the Sea Otter population stock, is not a strategic stock under MMPA.&#160; Population range expansion is expected to continue in this region, however, population growth rates have been lower than predicted for the region.&#160; Legal and illegal harvest may be contributing factors to the slow growth.&#160; There are heightened conflicts with commercial dive fisheries in this region.&#160; Recent clarifications were made to the MMPA definition of “significantly altered” for Native handicrafts made from Sea Otter fur by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.&#160; Elected Alaska leadership explored placing a bounty on sea otter pelts to help reduce the Sea Otter population in order to protect shell fisheries.&#160; Along the North American coast south of Alaska, the Sea Otter's range is discontinuous. Between 1969 and 1972, 89 Sea Otters were shipped from Alaska to the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia Canada. They established a healthy population, estimated to be 4,712 as of 2011, and their range is now from Tofino to Cape Scott. In 1969 and 1970, 59 Sea Otters were translocated from Amchitka Island to Washington State; the population estimate in 2012 was 1,105 individuals, and their range is in the Olympic Peninsula from just south of Destruction Island to Pillar Point. In Washington State, the Sea Otter population is listed as Endangered under Washington State’s Endangered Species Act.&#160; Population growth is expected to continue in this region.&#160; In California, the 2013 population estimate was 2,941; counts are down from an estimated pre-fur trade population of 16,000 (USGS unpublished data). California's Sea Otters are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern Sea Otters discovered near Big Sur in 1938; their principal range is now from just south of San Francisco to Santa Barbara County. The southern Sea Otter is listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and a strategic stock under the MMPA. This population is also listed as “fully protected” under State law in California.&#160; The population has been numerically stable for the past 5-6 years with a low annual growth rate of &lt;1%/yr.&#160; There have been increased shark related mortalities in the southern part of the range and mortality from shark bites is the primary known cause of mortality at this time.&#160; The Southern Sea Otter Translocation programme was recently terminated and the subpopulation on San Nicolas Island is no longer considered experimental.<br/><br/>In summary, population range expansion continues for translocated sea otters in B.C.,Canada, Washington, and SE Alaska but at diminished rates of increase from the previous decade. The cause(s) of the reduced population growth rates are unclear at this time. The Sea Otter population recovery in the Endangered Species Act listed areas of California and SW Alaska are still a major concern for the species as a whole. Reports of declining trends in Sea Otter abundance along the Kamchatka Peninsula and Kuril islands in Russia are also a major concern and require further investigation.",Decreasing,"<p>  </p>Historically, Sea Otters occurred across the North Pacific Rim, ranging from Hokkaido, Japan, through the Kuril Islands, the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Commander Islands, the Aleutian Islands, peninsular and south coastal Alaska and south to Baja California, Mexico (Kenyon 1969). In the early 1700s, the worldwide population was estimated to be between 150,000 (Kenyon 1969) and 300,000 individuals (Johnson 1982). Although it appears that harvests periodically led to local reductions of sea otters (Simenstad <em>et al</em>. 1978), the species remained abundant throughout its range until the mid-1700s. Following the arrival in Alaska of Russian explorers in 1741, extensive commercial harvest of Sea Otters over the next 150 years resulted in the near extirpation of the species. When Sea Otters were afforded protection by the International Fur Seal Treaty in 1911, probably fewer than 2,000 animals remained in 13 remnant colonies (Kenyon 1969).&#160; Remnant populations were located in the Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and in the Commander Islands Russia; five in southwestern Alaska (the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Kodiak Island), and one remnant population in each of the following regions; south-central Alaska (Prince William Sound), Canada (Queen Charlotte Islands), central California, and Mexico (San Benito Islands) (Estes 1980). However, the Queen Charlotte, Canada and San Benito Island, Mexico remnant Sea Otter subpopulations have presumably died out and likely did not contribute to the recolonization of the species following near extirpation (Kenyon 1969).<br/><br/>In North America, the Sea Otter’s range is currently fairly continuous from the Aleutian Islands to Prince William Sound with population gaps along the Gulf of Alaska until Yakutat (which was a translocated population) with another gap in the population’s distribution until the outer islands of southeast Alaska (also a translocated subpopulation from the Aleutian Islands and Prince William Sound). The next gap in the Sea Otter population distribution is between southeast Alaska and British Columbia, Canada.&#160; Translocation efforts were successful in Washington State but not in Oregon thus there is a large population gap between the small Sea Otter subpopulation in Washington and that of central California.","Information pertaining to Sea Otter trade has been taken from <a href=""http://www.answers.com/topic/sea-otter-trade"">http://www.answers.com/topic/sea-otter-trade</a>.&#160; Europeans and Americans first ventured to the North Pacific coast of America in the late eighteenth century in pursuit of Sea Otter skins. As the Pacific counterpart to the Atlantic Beaver trade, the Sea Otter trade led trappers into the North Pacific, where they established bases from the Aleutian Islands to Baja California. In China, Sea Otter furs were exchanged at good profit for prized Oriental goods.<br/><br/>Russia and Spain were the pioneer nations to engage in the Sea Otter trade. After Vitus Bering's expeditions in the early eighteenth century, promyshlenniki (fur traders) pushed eastward, and in 1784 they established the first permanent Russian settlement in America, on Kodiak Island. In the same year, Spain organized a Sea Otter trade between California and China. At the opening of the nineteenth century, American and Russian traders entered the California Sea Otter fields, where in the face of strong opposition they poached throughout the Spanish period. After 1821 the liberal commercial policy of independent Mexico stimulated the California Sea Otter trade, and many Americans became Mexican citizens to participate in the business. Between 1804 and 1807 it is estimated that almost 60,000 furs were taken by American vessels, while the period 1808–1812 yielded nearly 50,000.<br/><br/>The Sea Otter trade ended once hunting nearly exterminated the animals. In general, the fur areas were exhausted in the order they were opened. Kamchatka and the Aleutians were depleted by 1790, Kodiak by 1805, Sitka to Nootka Sound by 1820, and California by 1840. A treaty signed in 1910 by the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and Japan banned the hunting of Sea Otters. However, Sea Otter trade still exists. Sea Otter pelts are also being sold in Russia, with at least 300 skins being sold on the black market in Moscow in summer 2005. Most of these were obtained illegally from the Commander Islands Biosphere Nature Reserve. Since then we have been informed that a further 300 Sea Otter skins were being sold openly on the black market at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, with 200 of them from the Commander Islands. Most of these skins will be sold on to the markets in China (IOSF 2006).<br/><br/>In Alaska the Marine Mammal Protection Act allows for coastal Native people to hunt northern Sea Otters for subsistence use (personal uses and barter or trade of unaltered pelts with other Native people), and for creating and selling authentic handicrafts or clothing provided the taking was not wasteful; there is no other legal harvest of Sea Otters.&#160; The harvest of Sea Otters is monitored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Marking, Tagging and Reporting programme and all pelts are required to be tagged within 30 days of the hunt. The five year mean of the annual harvest reported to the Service for all three population stocks totalled&#160; 765 Sea Otters (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Stock Assessment Reports <a href=""http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/sars/species.htm"">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/sars/species.htm</a>).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<em>Enhydra lutris nereis</em> is listed on CITES Appendix I. All other subpopulations are included on CITES Appendix II. In Canada, Sea Otters are protected and managed under the Species at Risk Act. In the United States, Sea Otters are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) and in southwest Alaska and California, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the federal agency responsible for their conservation and management. The ESA also makes it illegal to buy, sell or possess any part of endangered species or items made from them. However, both the ESA and the Act allow for coastal Native people in Alaska to harvest Sea Otters for personal use, trade, barter, and the development of cottage industry. Native subsistence harvest of Sea Otters is monitored by the Service through a Marking, Tagging and Reporting programme. The Service and Native organizations conduct joint population surveys and dialogue on important conservations issues. The MMPA also mandates that efforts must be made to recover the species, which means creating and implementing a plan for returning them to healthy population levels.<br/><br/>In southeast Alaska, there are strong pressures to develop incentives to increase levels of Sea Otter hunting and marketing of pelts in order to decrease the population. Any such actions should be considered very carefully in light of climate change stressors, such as ocean acidification, and historic population patterns for this species.&#160; It was the commercial value of Sea Otter pelts that lead to a near extinction of the species; the global market still exists for Sea Otter and all other 12 species of otter pelts. While the MMPA provides for cottage industry of Sea Otter fur products of coastal Alaska Native people, this specific exemption is not designed to manage the harvested populations and must proceed in a manner which would prevent illegal trade for Sea Otter pelts.

However, an overall decline can be inferred and projected from information from a small set of monitoring programs and suspected from threats directly affecting this species and its habitat. This decline is inconsistent across its range, and the overall rate of decline is poorly defined, but is likely to approach but not exceed &gt;30% over a 27-36 year (=three generation) period.","The Platypus is restricted to streams and suitable freshwater bodies, including some shallow water storage lakes and ponds (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 2008). Its food is almost exclusively benthic macroinvertebrates and so the species is water-dependent. Platypuses are largely solitary, and when not foraging in water they normally occupy a resting or nesting burrow in earth banks, although some individuals have been found resting in accumulated stream debris or in low dense vegetation. The species is seldom observed moving on land in mainland Australia, but is frequently seen out of the water in Tasmania, where its predator, the fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>), has been introduced only relatively recently (T. Grant, S. Munks, F. Carrick, and M. Serena <em>pers. comm. </em>2014). The breeding season varies widely depending on location. Females produce one to three eggs annually, but usually two (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 2008). Platypuses are long-lived animals (up to 20 years in the wild).","Currently, the predominant threat to the species on the mainland is reduction in stream and river flows due to recent successive droughts, stream regulation, and extraction of water for agricultural, domestic, and industrial supplies. It is also at risk from the opposite extremes associated with climate change – extensive flooding both in space and time associated with recent tropical cyclones that have resulted in increased mortality and all but eliminated recruitment in 2006 over a substantial part of the species’ northern range. Habitat modification due to bank erosion and stream sedimentation (as a result of poor land management practices in agriculture, forestry, and urbanization) are also of great concern. In the case of urban streams, Platypus populations may be adversely affected by poor water quality (in the form of suspended solids and nutrient enrichment), contamination of sediment by heavy metals (Serena and Pettigrove 2005) and entanglement in or ingestion of plastic, rubber and metal litter. Accidental drowning in nets and traps set for fish and crustaceans has the potential to impact<em> Platypus</em> distribution and abundance in all parts of its range, especially in small streams where populations may be critically small. Populations in Tasmania are affected by mucormycosis (associated with the fungal pathogen <em>Mucor amphibiorum</em>) (Obendorf <em>et al.</em> 1993). Across its range, the Platypus is also subject to predation by the introduced Red Fox, dogs and cats.","<p>Difficulties in reliably quantifying platypus abundance compromise estimation of population size and its trends (Gust and Griffiths 2009). There has been no robust assessment of the population size of the Platypus either nationwide or for the key states in the species’ geographic range. Lunney <em>et al</em>. (2008) stated that ‘It is a common species’, but noted that ‘in general there is a surprising lack of knowledge about its abundance’. Carrick <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered it ‘common (though rarely abundant)’ but regarded it as ‘potentially vulnerable due to its specialised dependence on established water bodies for food and shelter’. Grant and Temple-Smith (2003) noted that the current and future conservation status of the Platypus is not easily predicted since their abundance is not readily measured. Since abundance is difficult to determine, population trends are generally poorly defined and the impacts of particular threats have been suggested and inferred, but rarely rigorously demonstrated (Gust and Griffiths 2009).<br/><br/>However, there have been some estimates of the number of individuals or of density for (parts of) individual rivers and for some areas. For Kangaroo Island, the size of the introduced subpopulation has been robustly estimated to be about 110 individuals (Furlan <em>et al</em>. 2012), with an effective population size of 11 individuals: this subpopulation was derived from a small number of individuals introduced between 1928 and the 1940s.<br/><br/>Platypus population densities in two reliably perennial rural streams in southern Victoria ranged from 1.3-2.1 subadults and adults per kilometre of channel (Serena 1994; Gardner and Serena 1995). In streams in high quality native forests at Lake Eildon National Park in central Victoria, densities were only 0.1-0.3 subadults and adults recorded per kilometre of perennial stream channel (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2001a, b). In a Tasmanian study of one catchment, catch rates were lower in headwaters than downstream reaches and in areas exposed to previous logging than in unmodified areas (Koch <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The extent of knowledge of population trends, and the trends themselves, have varied across its range. There is little available information on trends in Queensland. In New South Wales, Dickman (1994) noted that it had ‘declined in all regions’; and some studies have demonstrated local declines or even disappearances in recent decades (e.g. Grant and Denny 1991; Grant 1992, 1993, 1998; Rohweder 1992, Rohweder and Baverstock 1999; Lunney <em>et al</em>. 2008; Serena and Williams 2010d). A state-wide survey in 1987-88 concluded that its overall distribution had not changed significantly since the 1950s (Grant and Denny 1991; Grant 1992), and this pattern was broadly evident in some subsequent broad-scale assessment in 1994-96 (Grant <em>et al</em>. 2000). A more detailed and systematic assessment was undertaken in 2006, based on community knowledge (D. Lunney <em>pers. comm.</em> 2013). This concluded that there had been no sharp overall decline, but there were more locations showing decline than increase.<br/><br/>In Victoria, the Platypus is faring far less well, with substantial declines over recent decades. Mark-recapture studies carried out along the Wimmera River and its tributaries indicated that this system (conservatively estimated to have supported &gt;1,500 Platypus at the time of European settlement) supported fewer than 200 individuals by the late 1990s, with numbers declining to &lt;30 individuals by 2007 (Serena and Williams 2007b); juveniles have not been recorded in this system since 2006 (Griffiths and Weeks 2012). Capture frequency in replicated surveys in the Coliban River in central Victoria declined five-fold from 2001 to 2010, presumably due to drought (Williams 2010). It has been lost from several largely self-contained catchments, including the Cardinia Creek system in the mid-1980s (Serena and Williams 2004), the Curdies River system in the mid-1990s (Serena <em>et al.</em> 2002), and the Bass and Avoca River systems in the mid-2000s (Serena and Williams 2007a; M. Serena <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). In the greater Melbourne area (across four hydrologically independent drainage basins) numerous subpopulations have contracted or become fragmented since 1995 as a by-product of urban or agricultural development and these are continuing to decline (Serena and Williams 2008a; Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2012). Elsewhere in Victoria, both reduced flow regimes and severe flooding have contributed to the local depletion or disappearance of Platypus subpopulations (e.g. Serena and Williams 2007b, 2008b, 2010c).<br/><br/>There is little information on recent population trends in South Australia (Kangaroo Island). In Tasmania, trapping surveys in 2008-09 indicated that it remains widespread (Geragthy <em>et al</em>. 2011) and occupies a diverse array of water bodies (Gust <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). The lack of evidence for major reductions in abundance or distribution across Tasmania should be treated cautiously given the insensitivity of existing measures to detect change, the lack of systematic, rigorous monitoring for the species, and the possibility that significant localised declines occurred but went unnoticed (Gust and Griffiths 2010).&#160;</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Platypus is endemic to Australia, where it is dependent on rivers, streams, and bodies of freshwater.

There are also a few system-specific studies in other states and community-based reporting of anecdotal occurrences of the species to a variety of institutional and private databases. Still more information about population numbers and monitoring are crucial, especially for a long-lived species such as the Platypus where a lack of recruitment can be masked until a dramatic population crash occurs as adults reach the end of their lifespan.<br/><br/>Population studies of fragmented populations should be a research priority, together with studies to help verify the current distribution and baseline population parameters in areas where the species has declined (Grant and Temple-Smith 2003). Once the Platypus becomes extinct in a river system, the likelihood of its re-colonising that system without human intervention is minimal (T. Grant, S. Munks, F. Carrick, and M. Serena <em>pers. comm.</em> 2014). One reintroduction program is underway in a single fire-affected stream in Victoria (Australian Platypus Conservancy). <br/><br/>Some populations of Platypuses have exhibited antibodies to <em>Leptospirosis</em>, probably transmitted via cattle, but no clinical symptoms have been observed. Mortality from an ulcerative dermatitis caused by Mucor fungus, however, has been recorded across many river systems in Tasmania. There is currently limited investigation of this disease, which should be a research priority both in that state and on the mainland where the fungus is also found (T. Grant, S. Munks, F. Carrick, and M. Serena <em>pers. comm. </em>2014).",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Recorded in semi-desert grassland with areas of Acacia scrub in oases with gardens and orchards surrounded by sandy desert and hamada, in gorges of wadis with some <em>Tamarix</em> and Oleanders (<em>Nerium oleander</em>). Roosts in dry caves, ruins, underground tunnels (including catacombs), mosques and old buildings. In summer sometimes roosts in fissures, small crevices and among boulders. The species is sendentary and it stores fat in autumn for the winter months.","Human disturbance in roost sites and pesticide use against locusts are the main threats. In arid areas of Iran which can not support high numbers of colonies, they aggregate in a few large groups which increases their vulnerability (M. Sharifi pers. comm. 2005). These are not thought to be major threats to the species as a whole at present.","Appears to be particularly abundant near oases. However, both distribution and abundance are undoubtedly insufficiently investigated because the roosts and suitable habitats are often unreachable. Colonies range in size from a few individuals up to several hundred. Up to 500 individuals have been reported in colonies in Jordan (Amr 2000). Occurs with other species in the genus, in Iran it is normally found in low numbers and low densities and it feeds on coleoptera (M. Sharifi pers. comm. 2005).

For this reason the species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting criterion A2cd) as its global  population is suspected to have declined by <em>ca</em> 25% over the past 15  years (three generations; generation length = 5 years, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). The decline  is expected to continue due to a continuing rise in hunting that stems  from increased demand of taxidermy ornaments worldwide. Some local  populations may be also threatened by the increasing habitat alteration,  vehicular traffic and disturbance to the roosts.","The species has been recorded in dry deciduous forests, dry dipterocarp  forest, small woodland patches, floodplain and various agriculture lands  such as paddy field, sugarcane field, orchard and mixed plantation  (Sharma 1986, Kruskop 2013, Madhavan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  2015, Hawkeswood and Sommung 2017). It is found roosting mainly in dried  leaves of banana, dry grass and sugar cane, but occasionally in green  leaves of banana and broadleaf trees, flower, half-built nest of Baya  weaver bird on mesquite tree, and paper shelter for wrapping guava fruit  (Sharma 1986, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hawkeswood and Sommung 2017, Patel <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Thailand, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  (2015) reported the roost sites are generally near irrigation water.  This species mostly roosts at a height between 1-1.5 m from the ground.  It frequently switches roost sites at short distances (&lt;800 m) every  to four days. It forms small family of three bats (one adult male, one  adult female, and one young) from February to September, but remain  singly and in pair in November and December. Paired animals primarily  have high fidelity of partnership through years with shared home range  but have no overlap with other individual, expect their young in a year.  Individual home range is generally small, 6.1 ha for males and 5.6 ha  for females in average, at short distance from day roosts (c. 350 m  averagely). The bat mainly feeds on small web spiders (Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  2015) most likely associated with its behaviour of fluttering flight  near ground vegetation (Smith and Xie 2013) and short high frequency  echolocation calls (Sripathy <em>et al.</em> 2006). They are apparently active during the day and are relatively sluggish when disturbed (Smith and Xie 2013).","The species is currently threatened by a large demand for its dry  specimen and skulls as tourism souvenir and ornament accessories in both  physical shops (locally and in foreign countries) and online worldwide  (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015). Specimens on sale have been observed in  souvenir shops in Ho Chi Minh city in Viet Nam and Weimar city in  Germany. It is also sold online worldwide, at least in Australia, China,  France, Japan, Netherlands, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United  States. Roost disturbance is another threat to this species most likely  due to its notable colouration and use of commercial crop plants in  cultivation lands. Witness of the bats in farming areas by local people have occasionally been reported from Sri Lanka and Thailand. In Sri  Lanka, a roadkill incidence (Karunarathna <em>et al.</em> 2017) and a cat  kill (Tharaka Kusuminda, pers. com.) of this species have been reported.  In South Asia, this species is potentially threatened by habitat loss,  through commercial logging, conversion of plantation lands to make way  for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002). Since most records of the species are from cultivated habitats,  use of chemicals for agriculture management is expected to be also  influential to the species.","Although the species is widespread, it does not appear to be common.  This may indicate its natural rarity or reflect a sampling bias from the  insufficient survey effort in non-forested habitats in its  distribution. It is usually found singly or in small groups with up to  four individuals in a single roost in South and Southeast Asia (Sharma  1986, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Patel <em>et al.</em>2017). In Thailand, 8-90 individuals were recorded from a single study site of 11 km² in area (Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015).",Decreasing,"This is a widespread species that has been recorded from  southern, northern, and northeastern South Asia, southern China,  mainland Southeast Asia and some major islands in insular Southeast  Asia. In South Asia, the species is known from Bangladesh (Dhaka  division) (Sarker and Sarker 2005, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2005),  India (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala,  Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal),  Nepal (Central and Mid-western Nepal) and Sri Lanka (Central, Eastern,  Sabargamuwa, Southern and Western provinces) (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Patel <em>et al.</em>  2017). In China, it has been recorded from much of southeast China  (Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Jiangxi and Hainan island) (Smith and  Xie 2013). In Southeast Asia, it has been recorded in all countries in  the mainland as well as the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali,  Lombok, Ambon, Halmahera and Ternate. Although it was previously  reported from Kalimantan, Sabah and Sarawak (Houston <em>et al.</em>  2008), the occurrence of the species in Borneo cannot be confirmed since  there is no collection record from that area. It is not listed in the  latest mammal checklist for Borneo (Phillipps 2018).

It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years), but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.</p>","<p>The Siberian Ibex&#160;primarily occupies mountainous regions from 500 to-5,500 m asl in rocky terrain and open alpine meadows and crags, seeking out lower elevations during the winter (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Recent studies indicate that the distribution and abundance of the species do not warrant a threatened status at this time although populations are declining where they come in contact with human populations.","This species occurs in moderately humid to dry regions  where there are areas of woody or brush cover. It is not found in the Amazon region and it avoids dense forests in other regions as well, although it occupies the edges of forests. It does not live in open areas but will feed in these areas, including many types of agricultural plantations, if cover is available nearby. It is found in both dry and moist Chaco regions (Cartes 1998, Chiarello 1999, Gonzalez 2004, Pinder 1997, Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997, Rivero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>It eats  a wide variety of plant species and is a selective feeder. It has pulses of frugivory depending on the area, season and availability of frutis, but is not essentially frugiverous in many areas, its habitat is not consistent with a frugivorous diet since it avoids forests where most of the fruit is found (Caballero 2001, Cartes 1998, Julia 2002, Pinder 1997, Stallings 1984).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs almost all year around with births in all months except May, June and July in Argentina and Bolivia and correlated with the rainy season in Brazil (Chavez 1999, Julia 2002). There is a post partum estrus and a gestation period of 7 months.<br/><br/><em>Mazama gouazoubira</em> is a small to medium sized deer, with head and body length 882-1060 mm, tail length 83-190 mm, and ear length 95-121 mm (Rossi 2000), shoulder height 500-650 mm and weight 11-25 kg (Duarte and Jorge 1998).  In Brazil, regional, ecological and individual variations in coloration of <em>M. gouazoubira</em> have frequently been reported (Duarte 1996, Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997, Rossi 2000). Light and brownish colors prevail in individuals living in grasslands, while forest populations tend to be darker and grayer, significant individual variation exists within a single population. <em>M. gouazoubira</em> can be readily distinguished from the most similar species, the Amazonian Brown Brocket <em>Mazama nemorivaga</em>, by its orange rump and dorsal side of the tail, larger rounded ears, smaller eyes and orbital cavities, and wider auditory bulla rather than chocolate brown rump and dorsal side of the tail, small pointed ears, large eyes, large orbital cavities, and narrow auditory bulla of the latter species (Duarte 1996, Rossi 2000).","In Argentina populations are generally declining due to hunting pressure and habitat loss. International hunting expeditions are organized in Argentina (Julia 2002). In Bolivia the populations seem to be staying constant in spite of great hunting pressure. In Brazil this is the most abundant deer species in the country, but populations are declining in certain areas (Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro). In Paraguay, the populations in general are remaining constant, but the species has disappeared from recently urbanized areas and areas of high human density. In general there is heaving hunting pressure and loss of animals due to kills by dogs as well as habitat loss.","Populations seem to be decreasing due to the advance of human populations. There is no evidence of fragmented populations and the species continues to be abundant in most of its range, decreasing or disappearing when close to human populations. Densities vary greatly. In Brazil densities of 0.35 – 1 individual/km² have been found (Pinder 1997), in Bolivia densities of 5-12 individuals/km² have been found (Rivero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).",Decreasing,"The Brown Brocket deer is found east of the dry, pre-Andean regions in Argentina and Bolivia, extending to the Atlantic coast on the west, its northern limit is south of the Amazon region and its southern limit includes all of Uruguay and up to the province of Entre Rios in Argentina.  Although some authors report its distribution throughout all of Brazil, more recent evidence indicates its substitution by <em>M. nemorivaga</em> in the region of the Amazon (Duarte 1996, Duarte and Jorge 1998, Rossi 2000, Weber and Gonzalez 2003).",Trade of this species is probably increasing (Julia 2002 pers. comm.).,Terrestrial,"The species occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its distribution: 5 national parks and 9 provincial reserves in Argentina; in almost all national parks and private reserves in Paraguay; in 7 national protected areas in Bolivia and in numerous protected areas in Brazil.

Recommended actions would be to implement and enforce controls on hunting, control stray dogs and to educate rural and village populations to conserve the deer rather than immediately trying to kill any individual that they see in the area.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Until the systematics of this taxa are better understood it is impossible to evaluate it against the categories and criteria of the IUCN Red List. Until we can define distribution and population size we cannot estimate reduction. In addition we have no evidence that this species will persist outside of forested areas. Thus some populations (which may be species or subspecies) are threatened while others are not, and until we understand the taxonomy we do not have enough information to evaluate it against threats.","This is the largest species of the Mazama genus. It weighs between 30 and 40 Kg and is 65 cm tall (Duarte, 1996).  Ribeiro (1919) and Vieira (1955) believe that this species occurs from Guianas and Peru to Rio Grande do Sul State of Brazil, including Paraguay and Argentina. Junqueira (1940) states that the Red Brocket Deer prefer large forests and riverbanks that are almost always covered with vast vegetation, thereby avoiding the sun.  In Argentina, Olrog and Lucero (1981) reported that <em>M. americana</em> inhabits closed fields. As Emmons (1990) stated, this species is adapted to living in forests. According to Bodmer (1997), this species in the Amazon prefer firm, humid forest borders. In the rain forests, Red Brocket Deer are predominantly frugivores with fruit making up around 80% of their diet. During seasonally dry periods the diet of <em>M. americana</em> switches to greater proportions of browse.","Hunting and habitat destruction represent major threats. The species is hunted for meat throughout much of its range, including several regions where subsistence hunting is legal.&#160; Habitat loss and fragmentation by forest conversion into agricultural and cattle lands is particularly serious for the red brocket deer populations in the Atlantic Forest, Chaco, Brazilian Cerrado and southern Brazilian Amazon. The great scale conversion of native forests into soy bean crops are the main related reason (Varela <em>et al.</em> 2010).","The species is suspected to be widespread at low density in northern and northwestern Venezuela. In some areas this species has been overhunted (in densely human populated, rural areas) but likely still occurs at natural densities in the vast sparsely populated areas of the Peruvian Amazon.",Unknown,"The Red Brocket Deer distribution ranges across northern South America from northern Argentina (Misiones, Salta, Jujuy, Tucumán, Formosa, Chaco and  Corrientes), Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam, Trinidad, Tobago, and Venezuela (Emmons and Feer 1997, Reid 1997, Medellín <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Juliá and Richard 2001, Wilson and Redder 2005).","Red brockets are the main subsistence hunting deer in neotropical forests and their biomass fourth in importance after peccaries and tapirs.

22158006,41783,Axis axis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Chital is listed as Least Concern because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large subpopulations. Although it is still declining in some sites (particularly outside protected areas), at the species level any such declines are at nowhere near the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. Historical declines may have been higher, but these occurred outside of the three generation window (&lt;30 years) used for purposes of applying Red List Criteria. Listing as Least Concern recognizes that there are two significant conservation issues with this species. Firstly, current densities are mostly well below what the habitat could support (and have been for decades), and secondly, the long-term persistence of nearly all subpopulations is dependent upon well secured protected areas: anything which caused the breakdown of current effective protection would allow a rapid rise in hunting levels and perhaps of domestic stock-grazing. These are the factors with which current Chital numbers are in an uneasy and fragile relationship. If such changes were to occur across a significant part of the range, reassessment of Red List status would be required: without effective protection, Chital’s population trend would emulate that of Eld's Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em>, another herding deer of rather open forests, but with a geographic range covering areas without long-standing effective protected areas. Regular monitoring of the status of Chital subpopulations would be prudent for this species.","Chital thrive in a variety of habitats, but avoid extremes such as dense moist (evergreen) forests and open semi-desert or desert. Moist and dry deciduous forest areas, especially adjoining dry thorn scrub or grasslands, appear to be optimal, and highest densities of Chital are reported from these habitats. Short grasslands of the terai, swampy meadows and glades adjoining forest areas, coastal dry evergreen forests, mixed forests or plantations with Teak Tectona grandis and Sal Shorea robusta are also used, and indeed over much of northern and southern India, its distribution closely matches that of Sal and Teak, respectively (Raman 2013). Chital is particularly frequent in grassland–forest interface, edge, and other ecotones (Krishnan 1972). Eisenberg and Seidensticker (1976) opined that dry deciduous habitats with scrub is the favoured habitat, while Karanth and Sunquist (1992) found mixed forests with teak plantations, moist deciduous patches and swampy grasslands to support high abundance of Chital. Kumar (2010) found that well-watered and well-protected moist deciduous forest patches in gently undulating terrain supported high Chital densities. Short grasslands are important because they provide little cover for predators such as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (Moe and Wegge 1994). The introduced subpopulation in Andaman Islands inhabits evergreen forests (Sankar and Acharya 2004) but native subpopulations are absent from the rainforest areas of the mainland. They tend to be only visitors to dense forests, to those adjoining more open habitats. Riverine forests within the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal are highly used by the deer for shade and cover during the dry season. The forest also provides good foraging with regard to fallen fruit and leaves that are high in nutrients needed by the deer. Four factors were identified by Schaller (1967) as delineating Chital’s distribution: (1) the need for water; (2) the need for shade; (3) an avoidance of high, rugged terrain; and (4) a preference for grass as forage. Although several observers have noted that Chital occurs mostly in flat areas and avoids hills and slopes (Schaller 1967, Khan 1996), this may not hold in areas where preferred habitats or forage is also available on slopes (Raman 2013, Kumar 2010). It occurs in both hilly and flatter terrain, mainly the latter, in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Siwalik hills, Bhat and Rawat (1995) found that Chital preferred slopes of 11–30°, while slopes exceeding 30° were used less. Also, use of south, southeast, and east aspects was higher than of north, northeast, northwest, and west aspects, reflecting the warmer environment of the former aspects. There was no difference in average Chital density in the hills and plains (Bhat and Rawat 1995). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Chital widely, including in coffee areas up to 14 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat use varies seasonally, reflecting food availability. Chital uses more wooded habitat during the cool-dry season and early summer (November to May), where fallen fruit, leaf litter, and browse are available. In open grassland and tropical dry thorn forest, Chital density increases with the onset of monsoon rains and flush of plant growth (Mishra 1982, Moe and Wegge 1994, Khan 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). In areas of their distribution with a mosaic of forest and grassland habitats, seasonal patterns in habitat use may be complex. In the Himalayan terai, Chital use of habitats with high grass availability increased substantially in the weeks following cutting and burning of grasses in January–February, attributed to fresh flush of grass growth after the burns and with the onset pre-monsoon and monsoon rains nearly two months later (Mishra 1982; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997). Similar behaviour has been reported from the grasslands of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh 1983).<br/><br/>Chital easily habituates to human presence, and herds often congregate in open areas near habitation or forest camps to spend the night, possibly due to greater safety from predators and poachers that shy away from these areas (Raman 2013).<br/><br/>Chital eats a wide variety of plants: about 160–190 have been recorded from across the species' range. It is predominantly a grazer but consumes more fallen leaves, flowers and fruits in winter/dry season (Sankar 1994, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Raman 2013). In addition to plant soft matter, crabs (in the Sunderbans; Stanford 1951), mushrooms (in Nepal; Moe and Wegge 1994) and rarely, bark (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996) are eaten. Close to human habitation, rubbish and even human faeces are occasionally taken (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Antler and bone chewing is also common. In Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, all age and sex classes are osteophagous, but such feeding was more common in velvet-antlered males, doubtless reflecting mineral needs during antler growth and mineralisation (Barrette 1985). Chital usually drinks water once a day, more frequently in summer. This restricts them to forest tracts with assured presence of water, even if only widely scattered.<br/><br/>In lowland Nepal, an individual’s total range incorporates a core area of about 32 hectares surrounded by foraging and cover areas of about 140 ha for females and 195 ha for males (Moe and Wegge 1994). Variation in range size occurs with site, season, sex and age of the animal. The basic social unit is a matriarchal family group, normally consisting of an adult female, her offspring from the previous year, and a fawn (Ables 1974). The usual herd is composed of two or more such family units and is often accompanied by individual deer of mixed sex and age-classes. Chital exhibits a fission-fusion system, or fluid group formation and dissolution (Schaller 1967, Mishra 1982, Barette 1991). Group composition changes frequently during feeding periods, during the rut when males frequently join groups of females (Schaller 1967), and while fleeing from predators (Dinerstein 1980). These social groupings of Chital do not remain permanent (Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972). Groups may number up to 150 or more individuals (De and Spillit 1966, Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Krishnan 1972, Fuchs 1977, Karanth and Sunquist 1992), sometimes even more: N.S. Kumar (pers. comm. 2008) counted 211 in one group during rainy season in Nagarahole and 203 in one group at Pench-Maharashtra near a water reservoir in summer. Measured sex ratios have all been biased towards females (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Pariwakam (2006) observed nearly 10,500 Chital in Bandipur and estimated the proportion of Chital in different age and sex classes as stags 27%, does 57% and fawns 16%. In neighbouring Nagarahole, age-sex categories of Chital were adult stags 26%, adult does 36%, yearling males 8%, yearling females 9% and young 21% (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). Breeding can occur at any time of year but there is some peaking at any given locality (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Heavy mortality of fawns in early weeks has been observed by several workers and fawn survival appears to be a key determinant of Chital population growth (Schaller 1967). Schaller (1967) estimated an annual fawn mortality of 48% in Kanha, Sharathchandra, and Gadgil (1975) estimated a constant monthly mortality of 26% over first nine months in Bandipur, Raman (1996) estimated a mean monthly mortality of 9.7% in Guindy. Pariwakam (2006) for the first time used a rigorous photographic capture-recapture approach to estimate the fawn mortality rate, and found it to be 66% over a six week study period in Bandipur. Further information on sociality and breeding is synthesised by Sankar and Acharya (2004) and by Raman (2013). Over a 10-year time period, Karanth and Kumar (unpublished data) have observed annual fluctuations in the Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole and Bandipur ranging between population densities of 10 to 40 animals per km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Chital is a prolific breeder, as documented by several empirical studies of the speed of increase by newly introduced subpopulations or in those where a factor restraining subpopulations was removed (Raman 2013 and references therein). In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole. This and its diverse diet and habitats allow high density where threats are controlled. It is even considered to be a pest in the Andamans (Banerji 1955).<br/><br/>The main causes of death are predation, diseases and accidents. Occasionally, stags kill each other when fighting (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Predation is by far the major cause of Chital mortality. Older Chital stags are more susceptible to it than are younger stags (Johnsingh 1983, Patel 1992, Karanth and Sunquist 1995). This may be due to their being less vigilant during rut, to their separation from the group after the rut, or to weakening from injuries from conflicts. In Kanha, Chital remains were found in about 52% of Tiger faeces and 59% of Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> faeces analysed (Schaller 1967). In Bandipur, Chital is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Dhole (78%), Leopard (55%) and Tiger (19%; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even in terms of the relative number of individuals taken, Chital is the predominant prey among the three large sympatric predators (Tigers about 33%, Leopards about 39% and Dholes about 73% in Bandipur; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole remains were found in about 31% of Tiger faeces, 44% of Leopard faeces, and 50% of Dhole faeces (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Sariska, around 54% of the faeces of Tiger and 21% of Leopard faeces contained Chital remains (Sankar 1994). Chital remains were found in about 53% of Tiger faeces in Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002) and 61% of Tiger faeces in Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Each Chital spends a major portion of its life in foraging, resting, and wandering within its range, with the relative extent of these activities determined by season (Schaller 1967). In a day, peak feeding times are around dawn and dusk. There are usually two major resting periods, before dawn and mid-day (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Considerable further detail on ecology, drawn from the relative wealth of studies on the species, with each item precisely referenced to source, is provided by Raman (2013).","There are presently no major global-level threats to Chital, although densities are widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock. There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000,&#160;Madhusudan and Karanth&#160;2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.<br/><br/>The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.<br/><br/>Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (= <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Chital declined drastically throughout its range up until the first two-thirds of the 20th century (see under Major Threats). Karanth<em> et al. </em>(2010) documented an estimated average extinction rate of 45% over the last 50 years in the Indian sub-continent. It is however ""locally"" abundant in well protected parts of its range in mixes deciduous habitats. In India it occurs in 123 protected areas and forest tracts (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India in Sankar and Acharya 2004). There are some large subpopulations in Nepal (e.g. Moe and Wegge 1994) where the population is probably currently stable and is anticipated to remain so in the immediate future (Hem Sagar Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Thousands survive in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh, and there are a few introducedsub populations on coastal islands in the south (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The reported ecological densities of Chital mostly fall within three to 50 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 4.51 +/- 1.05 (SE) per&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 51.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 49.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 50.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 20.1 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.2 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 38.4 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); BRT mixed deciduous forest, 9.4 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Dandeli-Anshi mix of evergreen and deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Panna dry deciduous forest, 10.2 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Chundawat and Karanth unpublished data); Kawal dry deciduous forset two animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Siddique 2010),&#160;and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some parts of the well-protected areas in Nagarahole and Bandipur are known to harbour densities as high as 80–100 Chital per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2010). Humar (2010) observed high spatial variation in the abundance of Chital in the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Nagarahole-Bandipur National Parks, which ranged between zero to 100 animals per km<sup>2</sup>. Kumar (2010) also found that Chital densities positively responded to higher levels of protection, forage quality, flat terrain and water availability.&#160;The highest population densities, of around 200 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, are reported for the Bardia National Park, Nepal (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994) and for the reintroducedsub population in Guindy National Park, southern India (Menon 1982, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). These high densities reflect habitat and food availability in the former area (Moe and Wegge 1994), and supplementary feeding and low predation in the latter (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Population densities in marginal habitats tend to be lower (Raman 2013; K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Chital is the most abundant ungulate in Nagarahole, and reaches higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and livestock grazing (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site. This found respective densities of 65 and 10 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>The Chital is almost completely dependent on active protection. Were this to be removed, the species' status in the 1970s suggests that rapid declines would occur. Even now, a very large proportion of its range supports subpopulations at significantly lower densities than the habitat could support.<br/><br/>The only subpopulation in Europe is on the islands of Brijuni (off Istria, Croatia), but B. Krystufek (pers. comm. 2008) has traced no information on its current status. Information has not been sought for this account on introduced subpopulations elsewhere, because they do not contribute to assessing the species’ Red List status.",Unknown,"The Chital occurs over 8–30°N in India (including Sikkim), Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). The western distribution boundary is formed by eastern Rajasthan (e.g. Sariska, Ranthambore and Keoladeo Ghana) and Gujarat (e.g. Sasan Gir). The northern boundary runs along the bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan below 1,100 m asl. The eastern boundary runs through western Assam (Golapara and Kamrup district as far east as the Dhunsiri River in Darrang district) to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit (Gee 1964, Schaller 1967, Raman 2013). Chital occur throughout the rest of peninsular India sporadically in the forested areas (Sankar and Acharya 2004), but in Bangladesh, it now occurs only in the Sundarbans, having vanished from the central, northeast and southeast regions (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>Chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands (India, during 1925–1930; Banerji 1955), Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Croatia (islands of Brijuni; Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999), Moldova, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Uruguay and the USA (California, Florida, Hawaiian Islands and Texas; Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). These introduced subpopulations have not been mapped. Not all introductions have succeeded: for example, some were introduced to west-central Slovenia (from the Brijuni islands) in the late 1940s or in 1950, but this introduction failed and is now therefore frequently reported as having been of Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>. One male, shot on 12 October 1950 and now in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, proves the identification (Krystufek 1999). Managed herds occur in parks throughout the native and introduced range and in many other areas.","Chital are hunted for food, sport, and a variety of other purposes. It is unclear as to the numbers of captive animals kept within the native range and even if such animals are used to supply the same markets as wild caught animals. Introduced subpopulations almost certainly do not supply the same markets as wild caught animals from the species native range.",Terrestrial,"Chital is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It occurs in many protected areas. Legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas are the two cornerstones of its current healthy conservation status. Subpopulations exceeding 20,000 Chital probably occur in and around a handful of conservation areas within India: the belt of about 3,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;between Koh river and Haldwani including the Corbett Tiger Reserve; the Gir Protected Area (about 1,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); Kanha Tiger Reserve (about 2,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); and the Nilgiris–Western Ghats sector including Nagarahole, Bandipur, and Mudumalai (about 5,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Raman 2013). Protected areas support more Chitals than do non-protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, although there is not currently such a great difference in densities as with the grassland species (Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em>;<em>&#160;</em>Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Ongoing habitat conversion trends outside protected areas will continue to increase the relative proportion of the total Chital population that they hold, and the maintenance of an extensive network of functional protected areas will remain the foundation of this species’ healthy conservation status. Part of this responsibility is vigilance by staff and partners of illegal poaching, which takes place at varying levels in most of the species range. Some recent cases have involved high-profile public role models, such as actors, poaching Chital and these warrant heavy court penalties. There is a strong case for prevention of livestock grazing in protected areas which hold Chital, partly to reduce risks of disease transmission, but mostly to prevent artificially low densities of Chital being forced through competition (see Threat Section).<br/><br/>Chital subpopulations have been studied in: Corbett (De and Spillit 1966), Kanha (Schaller 1967), Bandipur (Johnsingh 1983, Kumar 2010), Nagarahole (Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Kumar 2010), Sariska (Sankar 1994), Gir (Khan <em>et al</em>. 1995, 1996), Guindy (Raman 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996), Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002), Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003) in India, Chitwan (Seidensticker 1976, Mishra 1982) and Karnali-Bardia (Dinerstein 1980; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997) in Nepal, and Wilpattu (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) in Sri Lanka.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22159478,136479,Muntiacus putaoensis,Data Deficient,,2016,2015-11-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leaf Muntjac is listed as Data Deficient, since there is a lack of certainty about the species' taxonomy, distribution, natural history, population, and threats. It is known from a limited area, but its range could be much more extensive. If the species' populations are susceptible to the high levels of hunting in the region, then this species could well be severely at risk. However, if the species is like Northern Red Muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>, then it may well be able to withstand the current hunting pressure and could warrant a listing of Near Threatened or perhaps even Least Concern. No substantive new information was received for the 2015 reassessment.","All known localities are in forest and like other muntjacs the Leaf Muntjac is probably tied to forest. There is no information available on its tolerance to degradation and fragmentation. The species occurs sympatrically with Northern Red Muntjac but is probably largely allopatric with <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, with the latter apparently at higher altitudes (R.J. Timmins and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). The species apparently feeds on a range of plant materials, including fruits, an examination of stomach contents by Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. (1999) revealed mostly fruit.","The major threat to Leaf Muntjac may be hunting, not targeted on this species, which is heavy throughout its Indian and Myanmar range (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2003, Than Zaw and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006), but the species' resilience to such hunting is unknown. The presumed Indian range is within areas of rapid habitat loss and human expansion, much of the Myanmar range is within an area which has seen remarkable stability of forest cover (Renner <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, this healthy situation may change in the near future, as some other forests of northern Kachin (which have not been surveyed for the species, and so may hold, or have held, it) have recently been devastated (Eames 2007). Although habitat needs, and thus the effects of forest fragmentation and degradation are essentially unknown, it is unlikely that viable populations can survive outright forest conversion. It is also likely that in areas where forest is being fragmented, negative effects of hunting on populations of Leaf Muntjac are compounded and populations decline, whatever intrinsic ability the species has to use fragmented areas.<br/><br/>Rabinowitz <em>et al.</em> (1999) suggested that this species and other muntjacs are less adaptable than other deer, and that this might explain the ‘restricted’ ranges of this and other small muntjacs. However, the most widespread muntjacs, <em>M. muntjak</em>, <em>M. vaginalis</em>, and <em>M. reevesi</em>, are very successful: they use a wide variety of forested habitats, and are well able to exploit secondary and degraded habitats. Secondly, and contrary to the statements of Rabinowitz <em>et al.</em> (1999) and others, which have not taken into account the patchiness of suitable surveying, the ‘small’ muntjacs comprising the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex are not particularly restricted in range, but are rather widespread in montane areas of northern southeast Asia. The lack of evidence of the complex from many areas, giving an apparent disjunct distribution, is much more likely to reflect the paucity of suitable surveys than the genuine distribution pattern. Survey work in southwest and southeast China, much of Myanmar, the Himalayan region and northern and western Thailand have certainly been insufficient to conclude anything about the range of this species-complex in those regions.","There is no substantive information on the global population size or trends for this species, but camera-trapping within the species' range has captured it with similar frequency to Northern Red Muntjac, suggesting that it is likely to be naturally abundant (R.J. Timmins and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Sample sizes are too small to say anything more conclusive (R.J. Timmins and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Villagers’ assessments of hunting levels suggest that the species is relatively abundant but decreasing over time (Rabinowitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999). Even speculative assumptions are hampered by the potential taxonomic issues, and the likelihood of misidentification both of ‘specimens’ and camera-trap images and through interpretation of local knowledge pertaining to muntjac species.",Decreasing,"The species is known only from a limited area in northern Myanmar and adjacent India. The known range is in the mountain region between the Mali Kha and Mai Kha rivers of the Hakakaborazi National Park and adjacent Naungmung area of northern Kachin state, Myanmar, south within Kachin state through the Hponkhanrazi range to the Bumpha Bum range (also known as Sumprabum), based on camera-trap data (R.J. Timmins and Than Zaw pers. comm. based on WCS unpublished data). Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004) stated there are also specimen records from the Hukaung valley and near Saramati massif, this latter extending the species' range south to 25°42′N, 95°13′E. Records of <em>M. putaoensis</em> from northeastern India (Datta <em>et al</em>. 2003) initially identified morphologically have been confirmed by recent genetic analysis of five specimens as <em>M. putaoensis</em> (James <em>et al</em>. 2008). Specimens came from the villages of Lumpang (96°10′09″E, 27°17′45″E) and of Mossang Putok (96°17′38″E, 27°20′37″E), in the general areas of the northeast part of Namdapha Tiger Reserve and reserve forests to the south-west in the Patkai hills in Jairampur Forest Division (Datta <em>et al</em>. 2003, James <em>et al</em>. 2008). Choudhury (2013) lists the species from Anjaw, Lohit, Changlang, Dibang Valley and Lower Dibang Valley districts of Arunachal Pradesh as well as several districts of Nagaland. The species could also occur east from its known range in Myanmar towards the border of China, and possibly into China, Wang (2003) listed the species, without caveat of identification for Yunnan, specifically ‘western parts-Tengchong, Lianghe, Yingjiang and Longchuan’. No details were given for the basis of this statement. During a review of muntjac specimens in the mammology collection of the Kunming Institute of Zoology in 2015 no specimens of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species group were found (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). The southern extent of the species’ range is very uncertain as little survey work has been carried out in potentially suitable areas. Furthermore all records of the species based solely on morphological characters should be viewed with caution because of the possibility of confusion with the morphologically very similar <em>M. gongshanensis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015, see that species Red List account).<br/><br/>The known elevational range based on camera-trap data is from 700 m to 1,220 m asl in Myanmar (R.J. Timmins and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS unpublished data), Indian specimens were reported by hunters to have come from 900–1,100 m asl (Datta <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). Choudhury (2013) gives reported ranges of 800 – 2000 m for Arunachal Pradesh and 1,700 – 3,000 m for Nagaland, but these should be viewed with extreme caution given the potential for confusion with <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and potentially another muntjac species in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> group. Amato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (1999b) stated that the Leaf Muntjac “resides ‘on mountain tops’ while the other two larger sympatric species, the common [Northern Red] muntjac, <em>M. muntjak</em>, and the [a taxon allied to] black muntjac, <em>M. crinifron</em> are found lower down”. Rabinowitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (1999) made a similar statement that the species was only found on “distant hilltops” away from village areas from 1,600 to 2,000 m asl. These statements are not consistent with more specific information from Myanmar and India, above.","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"There is limited knowledge on this newly discovered species, and more information is needed on its biology, ecology, threats, and population size and trends.

Historically, this species was known from high damp forest in the northeastern Myanmar just below the snow line.

This is based on an inferred population decline as a result of habitat loss, which may have approached 20-25% over the last ten years. Habitat conversion to agriculture and cattle farming, and hunting and persecution by feral dogs are constant threats, and the species is confined to a human dominated landscape with only patches of remaining habitat. The former Pampas Deer range has been dramatically reduced from 95 to 99% of the original habitat in the last century. Today less than 1% of the habitat remains (González<em> </em>1993, 1996). Although the Pampas Deer is adaptable to some degree of habitat modification, it should be monitored to ensure rates of decline do not increase. Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat to the existing population (González 2004, González <em>et al.</em> 2010).","The species occupies a range of open habitats in the Neotropics, in particular grassland areas and the cerrado shrublands. In Argentina, it also occurs in coastal salt marshes.","Habitat conversion for agriculture and competition with domestic livestock have been reported as threats to the Pampas Deer (Wemmer 1998). Due to the fragmentation of the remaining habitat the small and isolated populations face other threats. Other threats include over-exploitation for food, hides, and sport, predation by feral dogs, and possibly bovine disease (Wemmer 1998). In Brazil in Paraná State, another cause of mortality, outside of the Conservation Units, is the juvenile and fawn mortality during the crop harvest (Braga 2004). Predation of fawns by feral pigs occurs in both San Luis and the Bahia Samborombon; and fawns are kept as pets by local people (J. Jackson pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Breeding of cattle and sheep is also signaled as one of the negative factors for the species, due to competition for food and habitat, or transmission of diseases (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Cosse <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Giménez Dixon 1987). However, there are situations where agricultural activity is compatible with the conservation of the Pampas Deer (Merino <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2011). The presence of dogs related with the cattle activities and, even more, of feral dogs that attack the deer is a serious threat (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Beade <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).","There is not update information of total population size there are partial estimation for population specifically in the Southern part of South America<em>.</em> The populations from Argentina and Uruguay show a declining trend (González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). A minimum estimate for the total population size is 20,000 (Pinder 1994), while the maximum population size is estimated at 80,000 (Pinder 1994) individuals.<br/><br/>The largest extant populations are found in Brazil, in the northeast cerrado ecosystem where about 2,000 individuals live, and in the Pantanal where 20,000 to 40,000 exist (Pinder 1994). While in the last years two subpopulations were discovered, one further north on the island of Marajo, at the mouth of the Amazon River (Rossetti and de Toledo 2006), extending the species range, and the other in the south of the country a small subpopulation in Paraná State estimated to be less than 100 individuals (Braga <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). <br/><br/>In Uruguay there are two main subpopulations: El Tapado (Salto Department) with 800 individuals, and Los Ajos (Rocha Department) with approximately 300 deer (Weber and González 2003). At the turn of the 20th century, the Argentinean population was likely very large since over 500,000 km² of grassland habitat was available. However, today only three small subpopulations remain: Corrientes (Ituzaingo Department) with about 170 individuals (Merino and Beccaceci 1999), in San Luís Province) with approximately 800-1000 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011) and coastal Bahía de Samborombóm (Buenos Aires Province) with about 200 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997) and in Santa Fé “Bajos Submeridionales” area there is a small subpopulation estimated to be less than 50 individuals which lives in an area of 23,000 ha. (Vera Department, Pautasso 2011). A small subpopulation may still be extant in the southeastern part of Bolivia (Weber and González 2003). Small subpopulations of Pampas Deer may still be extant in the National Park Noel Kempff Mercado (Santa Cruz Department), in southwestern Bolivia (Anderson 1985, 1993; Tarifa 1993). However, it is restricted to relatively small patches of suitable habitat and may have become locally extinct in some of them.",Decreasing,"The Pampas Deer occurs in insular populations in western, northern, and  central Argentina, eastern Bolivia, central and southern Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay. Prior to the 1800s, the species was abundant  throughout the grasslands of South America (Wemmer 1998, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>  2010). The Pampas Deer was a widespread species occupying a range of  open habitats, including grasslands, pampas and the Brazilian savanna  known as the Cerrado, in eastern South America from 5º to 41ºS (Cabrera  1943, Jackson 1987, Merino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002, González 2004, Weber and González 2003, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2010).

22160266,13927,Muntiacus feae,Data Deficient,,2016,2015-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is listed as Data Deficient due to uncertainties over the validity of many reports of the species, and thus uncertainty over its geographic and ecological range and conservation status. If the species has a predominantly montane distribution between the Isthmus of Kra and ca. 16°N, then it might only be Least Concern or Near Threatened (this latter would be based primarily on range criteria), due to stability of habitat in protected areas and a relatively low hunting intensity in Thailand, especially at higher elevations. However, if it has a much wider distribution in Myanmar and or has a distribution significantly down to lower elevations, the species could be in one of the threatened categories by hunting and habitat loss especially in Myanmar. The high uncertainty over the species’ status even in the minimum conservative range of the species in Myanmar further clouds the assessment. If the species occurs (or occurred) in lowland forests in Myanmar, then it would almost certainly qualify as threatened, due to the loss of forest to plantations and high hunting pressure.","The limited information available suggests that the species is tied to evergreen forests of the hills and mountains of western Thailand and adjacent Myanmar (and perhaps further afield). The elevational range of the species is uncertain. In Myanmar evergreen forests are found down to the lowlands because of a relatively wet climate throughout the year, but on the more seasonal eastern Thai side lower elevations are predominantly clothed in drier often deciduous forest types. Its ecology appears to be similar to other muntjacs and it seems to share some of the widespread socio-ecological traits of other muntjacs, i.e. it is predominantly solitary and favours fruits and leaves in its diet (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). <br/><br/>Towards the centre of their known Thai range, in Kuiburi National Park, Fea’s appears to be relatively common in evergreen forest, being camera-trapped more frequently than Northern Red Muntjac even at elevations of 300 m asl. In open forest types, however, Northern Red Muntjac clearly dominates, and Fea’s doesn’t appear to use deciduous forest types much (if at all), for example in Kuiburi National Park it comes right to the edge of open habitat but doesn’t cross the line out of evergreen forest. In contrast, northern red muntjac overlaps with Fea’s in evergreen forest, including high elevation, although Fea’s may be the more common in montane evergreen forest above 1000 m asl (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, but see note under Distribution about provisional status of such records). Further north in Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary the species appears to be commoner (based on cameras, sightings and interviews) than Northern Red Muntjac in forest habitats up to at least 1,000 m asl (there has been little survey work at higher altitudes), although sign abundance of muntjac species certainly declines with increasing altitude, especially above 1,000 m asl (Steinmetz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). In contrast within Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, which lies at a similar latitude to Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary, but further east, Fea’s Muntjac is rare even in montane evergreen forest. This may be due to a rain shadow effect which leaves forest in the east drier than forests in Myanmar or close to the border in westernmost Thailand (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). The animals camera-trapped in Kaeng Krachan National Park probably use both semi-evergreen forest and a narrow band of secondary mixed deciduous forest at elevations of around 350 m and above (Dusit Ngoprasert pers. comm. 2014).","The species may be threatened at some level by a decrease in available habitat and by hunting. Most remaining habitat for the species in its presumed Thai range is now effectively protected and many of the surviving forest blocks are large, in particular the Western Forest Complex. Therefore it seems unlikely that the species is in serious threat from either factor at the present there (but note the uncertainty over range and the identification of many records) (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). The apparent commonness of Fea’s Muntjac at low elevations in Kuiburi National Park, where hunting of this and Northern Red Muntjac occurs, suggests a similar degree of tolerance to hunting pressure as the later species, hunting was thought to have been relatively heavy in the past, enough to have significantly reduced all ungulate populations, although the initiation of protection measures appears to have turned the tide (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, 2014). The species' use of lower elevations is imprecisely known, and may be related to climatic factors, thus if the species naturally occurred at relatively high densities in ‘wet’ lower forests, then the threat level faced by the species would be undoubtedly higher. Thus, even within the Western Forest Complex the ‘available habitat’ for Fea’s Muntjac would be concentrated at higher elevation, and in Thailand’s protected areas as a whole, land below <em>ca.</em> 400 m and areas of gentle terrain at higher elevations forms only a moderate fraction, <em>ca.</em> 30% of the total area (Chutipong <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The Thanintharyi (= Tensasserim) region of Myanmar is currently relatively intact, but the ongoing and projected conversion of forests to oil palm plantation in southern Myanmar (Leimgruber <em>et al.</em> 2005) is some level of threat. Such conversion could destroy all large blocks of forest in the lowlands and adjacent lower hills, which includes some of the elevation range of the species. Forest and thus deer at higher elevations would probably remain secure. Altitudinal distribution of the species is too little understood to allow adequate assessment of this threat.<br/><br/>It is thought that the forests of Tenasserim are much more heavily poached than adjacent Thai forests, and for instance poachers from Myanmar regularly cross the border into Kuiburi National Park, despite the fact that ungulate densities in Kuiburi National Park are already relatively low, thus suggesting that hunting intensity is much higher and ungulate densities now much lower in Myanmar (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2014). Hunting levels in the known Myanmar range can be assumed to be high (Than Thaw pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>In the Taninthayi Nature Reserve (1,700 kmsq), in the northern Thanithayi Range, wildlife protection is limited despite the presence of park staff, and local professional hunters come in to the Nature Reserve to hunt a wide variety of species including muntjac. Local people adjacent to the area also use snares in the vicinity of their agricultural areas, and some also use home-made guns. Around 2005 a gas pipeline was constructed across the southern part of Taninthayi Nature Reserve. The pipeline, with a service track alongside it, is guarded by the army who have camps along it. The military personnel mainly rely on wildlife for their daily ration. The area affected is perhaps 15% of the Nature Reserve. Logging is also occurring, although on a small scale. In the southern Taninthayi range the situation is worse, largely because of the presence of many immigrant workers from central Myanmar, who have come to the area to work for oil palm and rubber plantations. These workers both set snares themselves and have also taught local communities these same snaring techniques. Hunting is much more openly practiced and is probably at least twice as worse as in the northern part of the range. The government is also still issuing licences to private timber companies for forest conversion to plantations, and already huge areas of land in the lowlands have been cleared to make way for oil palm and rubber plantations. There are two proposed protected areas in southern Taninthayi Range and one proposed protected area in the northern Taninthayi Range, none of which have any permanent staff (all Nay Myo Shwe pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In northern Myanmar (not confirmed to be within the species' range), muntjacs are commonly hunted, particularly for pelts (Than Thaw pers. comm. 2006). In Thailand, Fea’s Muntjac is apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, perhaps because of scarcity relative to <em>M. vaginalis </em>in many of the areas supporting most of the hunting, and in several especially eastern areas its primary range in higher elevations which are not visited frequently by hunters (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008).","Taking Thai records assigned to <em>M. feae</em> as truly representing the species, it is not infrequently camera-trapped and observed in evergreen forests of the mountains in Western Thailand, especially the Klong Saeng forest complex, Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary and Kuiburi National Park, and at least in the latter two areas, in evergreen forest, appears as or more common than Northern Red Muntjac (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014, but see note under Distribution about provisional status of such records). <br/><br/>Other than one possible camera-trap photograph from northern Myanmar (see Geographic Range above), no primary sources have been traced for recent status in Myanmar. It is solely assumed that the species would have been relatively widespread in the climatically wetter forest of Tenasserim (than the drier more westerly Thai forests) in a latitudinal range similar to that in Thailand. But it is thought that the forests of Tenasserim are much more heavily poached than adjacent Thai forests (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2014).",Unknown,"Although the distribution of this species is usually given as from the Isthmus of Kra north and east through southern Myanmar and the adjacent Thai borderlands (Groves and Grubb 1990, Grubb 2005), there was until recently scant evidence of clearly identifiable records (i.e. those accompanied by information on diagnostic characters) from either country (i.e. some range localities appear to be based solely on reports from local people, Tun Yin 1967). Recent discoveries of new species of muntjac and extensions of known range for other muntjac species mean that some previous Thai and Myanmar localities for ‘<em>M. feae</em>’ (see Groves and Grubb 1990) should be viewed with caution. The presence in China remains unconfirmed (see taxonomic note). This leaves only the type locality of east of Moulmein, Myanmar, Muang district (9.08°N, 99.14°E), Surathani Province, and Raheng, Pangna Province (northeast of Phuket island), based on the origin of Thai captive animals and a Gairdner specimen in the Natural History Museum (NHM), London. Two other Gairdner specimens in the NHM, London are incomplete lacking skulls and heads (one of these was reportedly obtained at 300 m asl) and therefore cannot morphologically be confirmed as being this species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Photographs of several muntjacs from Kaeng Krachan National Park (Thailand) appear to be of this species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on Dusit Ngoprasert/WCS unpublished data). Camera-trapping in the western forest complex of Thailand has apparently documented the species on several further occasions, and animals have also been observed in the field (Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014, Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008), but identification of these animals could be considered provisional because it has been assumed that only two muntjac species inhabit this part of Thailand (<em>M. feae </em>and <em>M. vaginalis</em>), this might not be the case. Animals have usually been identified on the basis of dark pelage and especially the blackish tail (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008), but such characters do not rule out some other muntjac species confirmed from neighbouring areas, including, <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and some animals in the, <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species complex. Dark pelage does not even completely rule out <em>M. vaginalis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most northerly of the recent records assigned to this species is from Mae Wong National Park in montane forest at 1,450 m asl (16° 4' 46'' N, 99° 7' 4'' E) (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>One photograph from 1,250 m asl in Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Myanmar shows a male with some features similar to <em>M. feae</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS unpublished data), and may refer to this species, particularly in the light of suggestions that the species is in China (see taxonomic note). This site lies far from the generally accepted Myanmar range of <em>M. feae</em> and raises the possibility that the species might have a much wider range in Myanmar than generally assumed. This record is not included in the distribution map (which should be considered highly provisional in any case). This record would also indicate sympatry with <em>M. gongshanensis</em>.","It could be assumed that this species is hunted by the local human populations, in a similar fashion to other species of the same genus, as a source of meat and perhaps to a lesser degree of skins and traditional medicines.",Terrestrial,"The species is presumed to be found within protected areas throughout its range; in Thailand, it is largely confined to protected areas (because most suitable habitat is now within protected areas), but it almost certainly will be found to persist both in and out of them in Myanmar.<br/><br/>There is a need for taxonomic work, including a re-evaluation of recent field and captive animals (there is a small captive population within Thai zoos) presumed to be <em>M. feae</em> with reference to the holotype, to determine that such animals are indeed this species. Diagnostic characters for the species also need to be clarified in light of recent discoveries of other muntjacs superficially similar in various morphological characteristics. Confirmation in particular is needed of camera trap records from Thailand and Myanmar as referring to this species rather than to any other darkish muntjac, and suggestions of the species' occurrence in China and far northern Myanmar need to be investigated (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). The species' status, habitat associations, and elevational limits need to be established with greater certainty (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22160596,13926,Muntiacus gongshanensis,Data Deficient,,2016,2015-11-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>M. gongshanensis</em> is listed as Data Deficient mainly because of a general lack of data on muntjac populations within the potential, but very poorly clarified, range of this species, exacerbated by the widespread confusion over its diagnostic characteristics (and even validity as a species) which hamper determination of its distribution. It could certainly be threatened, especially if it were found to have a relatively small range, but it is more likely that its range is relatively large. It remains unclear how the species responds to hunting. If it is like Northern Red Muntjac then it could sustain high levels of hunting, but there is no reason to assume either that it is so resilient or that it is not. Habitat degradation is an increasing threat throughout its range but, again, there is no information on its effects on the species. No new information of significance has been received since 2008 to change significantly the 2015 reassessment.","Presumed <em>M. gongshanensis</em> has been camera-trapped between 1,250 and 2,750 m asl in Northern Myanmar (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS Myanmar Programme unpublished data, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006). A paratype was collected at 3,000 m asl in northwestern Yunnan (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1990). Specimens in the NHM and FMNH from northern Myanmar were reportedly taken between 900 and 1,850 m asl. Wang (1998) gave the species' elevation as 2,000 m asl, in alpine broadleaf forests, coniferous forests and mixed forests, and in Tibet it occurs at 1,800–2,600 m asl. Presumed Camera-trapped animals in Myanmar have been found from subtropical forests through temperate thick mountain forests up to Himalayan alpine shrubland (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006). It is uncertain if <em>M. gongshanensis</em> is widely syntopic with other muntjac species. Camera-trap results from northern Myanmar suggest that it occurs largely above the altitudinal ranges of other species there (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS Myanmar Programme unpublished data). No ecological separation between Gongshan and Northern Red Muntjacs in the Gaoligongshan was discussed by Ma <em>et al</em>. (1994), but Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004) considered that Red Muntjac generally lived at lower altitudes than presumed Gongshan Muntjac in south-east Tibet. Gongshan Muntjac’s use of degraded and fragmented forest has not been assessed.","The major threat appears to be from hunting throughout the known range of the species. In Myanmar muntjacs including presumed Gongshan Muntjacs are hunted (non-specifically within general ungulate hunting) for meat, but also for skins which are used widely for clothing. In Hkakaborazi National Park, some hunting is by the relatively small number of permanent inhabitants of the park, who trade wildlife and plant products for basic livelihood support, such as salt. More serious are organised non-local heavily armed parties of professional poachers who enter the protected area for months at a time and hunt intensively to supply the wildlife trade. The numbers of such groups per year seem to be increasing. Hunting patterns in other areas supporting the species are not well known, but it is likely that anywhere in this region with a large population of ungulates remaining attracts heavy hunting from outsiders (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1998, Rabinowitz and Saw Tun Khaing 1998, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Heavy hunting pressure from hill tribes was reported from Yunnan Province (R. Wirth pers. comm. 1990), and although there are no current data available from China, hunting is thought to remain a major threat there. The Chinese population has been considered rare and small, and threatened by hunting (Wang 1998), but this assumes a far more limited distribution than is likely. Much of the Myanmar range is within an area which has seen remarkable stability of forest cover (Renner <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, this healthy situation may change in the near future, as some other forests of northern Kachin state (which have not been surveyed for the species, and so may hold, or have held, it) have recently been devastated (Eames 2007). Although habitat needs, and thus the effects of forest fragmentation and degradation are essentially unknown, it is unlikely that viable populations can survive outright forest conversion. It is also likely that in areas where forest is being fragmented, negative effects of hunting on populations of this muntjac are compounded and so populations decline, whatever intrinsic ability the species has to use fragmented areas. Protected area coverage, and retention of little-encroached habitat, is also relatively good in the Gaoligongshan of China at high altitudes (Lan and Dunbar 2000).","Presumed <em>M. gongshanensis</em> has been regularly captured by camera-trapping studies in appropriate habitat across a wide spread of sites within two protected areas in Kachin state, northern Myanmar, capture rates appear roughly equivalent for those of other muntjac species elsewhere in Myanmar and Asia, suggesting a large population which is well above criteria for threatened status (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS Myanmar Programme unpublished data). Moreover, substantial areas of Kachin state in the altitudinal range thought to be occupied by this species have not been surveyed by methods appropriate to find the species since the Vernay–Cutting Expedition (Anthony 1941). Overall population status depends to a significant degree on the geographic range of the taxon, which is poorly clarified at present, but could be significantly larger than has so far been documented (see Distribution). There is no empirical evidence of population trends.",Decreasing,"<em>Muntiacus gongshanensis</em> was described from Yunnan province, south-western China (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1990), within which its distribution spans the latitudinal range of about 25°–28°10′N (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1994). It also occurs in Kachin state, northern Myanmar: there are several specimens over the latitudinal range of 26°46′N–28°10′N in NHM and FMNH (note specimens are not catalogued under the name <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Recent reports by Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Amato <em>et al</em>. (1999b, 2000), where <em>M. gongshanensis</em> was considered synonymous with <em>M. crinifrons</em>, presumably refer to this species (Grubb 2005), although insufficient morphological characters are given to allow a firm identification. However, from the same area come many recent camera-trap photographs morphologically consistent with <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, specifically from Hkakaborazi National Park and Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, which lie within the specimen-validated latitudinal range (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS Myanmar Programme unpublished data). <br/><br/>Gongshan Muntjac also probably inhabits southeastern Tibet: Chen <em>et al</em>. (2007) reported animals from Modog and Damu counties, close to the China, India and Myanmar border, in the range 28°33′–29°29′N, 95°20′–97°05′E. They based their identification (as <em>M. crinifrons</em>) solely on mtDNA and no morphological voucher seems to be available (small pieces of pelt may have been preserved), and no characters were discussed other than that the pelt was dark. Specimen-based records, again as <em>M. crinifrons</em> with <em>M. gongshanensis</em> explicitly considered a synonym, from this general area were reported by Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004), from the rivers Pailong and Yigong (30°07′N, 95°02′E) and the Modog area to the south, and from near Zayu at 29°56′N, 94°48′E, again, no morphological characters were given sufficient to allow identification to species. Inglis (1952) referred to melanistic (“very dark brown”) muntjacs, sometimes almost black, in the Darjeeling district (27°02′N, 88°16′E), one was at this time mounted in the Darjeeling museum. Whether this specimen is still extant is unclear, and no analysis more substantial seems to have been published on these animals. However recently such animals have apparently been camera-trapped in the Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary, Darjeeling, with speculation that they could be M. crinifrons or M. gongshanensis (Mukherjee 2013). A search of the internet revealed a number of photographs of captive ‘black’ muntjacs from the Darjeeling and adjacent Sikkim region of India, these animals are completely blackish all over including the underside of the tail, and essentially have no features in common with <em>M. gongshanensis </em>or <em>M. crinifrons</em>, it seems most probable that they are melanistic <em>M. vaginalis</em> (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Unfortunately creating further confusion (as of November 2015) images of one of these presumed melanistic muntjacs from Sikkim was used to illustrate the species <em>M. crinifrons</em> on the website “http://www.arkive.org/” (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on information from G. Cubitt in litt. 2014). <br/><br/>Also in India, Johnsingh (2004) stated that <em>Muntiacus crinifrons</em> was discovered in Arunachal Pradesh, the actual location and basis for identification remain unpublished, but this seems more likely to refer to <em>M. gongshanensis</em> than to <em>M. crinifrons</em> (but again could also potentially refer to some other taxon such as one of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex). Likewise<em> M. crinifrons </em>was reported from Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh (Datta 2003), but the authors make no mention of <em>M. gongshanensis.</em> And apparently a new field guide to Indian mammals (Menon 2014) refers to “Gongshan Muntjac and Black Muntjac as a same species” (Aiyadurai and Meme 2015). <em>M. gongshanensis</em> has been reported from the Mishmi hills, Arunachal Pradesh based on skin and skull remains (Choudhury 2003, 2009, 2013), but seemingly not Pangsha village, Nagaland, as reported by Aiyadurai and Meme (2015). However, the certainty of identification is hard to verify as <em>M. gongshanensis</em> has morphological similarities with the <em>M. rooseveltorum </em>species complex (which includes <em>M. putaoensis</em>, also reported from North-east India), including small antlers, a photo (Choudhury 2009) of a “Leaf Muntjac” trophy arguably has more similarity with <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, whilst another photo&#160; (Choudhury 2013) of purportedly of a male “<em>M. gongshanensis</em>” skull arguably has more similarity with an animal of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species complex.<br/> <br/> Camera-trapping studies in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have many images not referable to Northern Red Muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em> or to Large-Antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em>. Many are certainly of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex of species, but given the external similarity of some specimens of the later to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, some photographs may in fact be <em>M. gongshanensis</em> or a closely related taxon (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on extensive examination of various camera-trapping programmes’ images). No certain specimen evidence has yet come to light which would support this.<br/><br/>In sum, if these records in Tibet, India and even Lao PDR and Viet Nam do refer to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, they indicate a much wider geographic range than the so-far specimen-validated distribution in Gaoligongshan (Yunnan, China) and Kachin state (Myanmar).",The species is actively hunted with snares and crossbows by the local population in Myanmar for its hides and meat (Rabinowitz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998). There is an active trade involving its hides with China (Rabinowitz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998).,Terrestrial,"Animals presumed to be <em>M. gongshanensis</em> have been found within two large protected areas in Myanmar, Hkakaborazi National Park and Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006); other areas of suitable habitat exist outside the protected area system in Myanmar but have not been surveyed using suitable methods. Neither have tracts of potentially suitable highlands in other proposed or declared protected areas such as Hukaung Tiger Reserve and Bumphabum Wildlife Sanctuary. The protected areas of Myanmar’s ‘Northern Forest Complex’ are evolving their management and full support is needed to ensure their success. This needs to tackle the issue of professional hunting parties as an urgent priority, and hunting by local inhabitants with sensitivity. It is known from two protected areas, Nujiang and Gaoligong reserves, in China, although it is not protected as a species there (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>An immediate need is to dispel the confusion surrounding this species' taxonomic validity, generated through inspection of part of its mtDNA, compounding the, to date, only weak discussions of its morphological distinctiveness, and to establish and communicate the diagnostic characteristics of the species. This requires re-evaluation of the types and other specimens in China, a review of as much modern material is available in Myanmar (specimens and photographs), and analysis of specimens held in internationally-accessible institutions (most or all of which are still catalogued under other names).<br/><br/>An analysis of sensitivity to hunting is needed, which should focus on the relative abundance of this and other muntjac species within heavily hunted areas.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22160753,13924,Muntiacus crinifrons,Vulnerable,A2cd,2016,2015-11-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species has been listed as Vulnerable since 1990 (24 years), with very little supporting documentation for this listing being given in recent years. Information received since 2008 is insufficient to suggest a certain change in status. In 2008 the justification was given as a probable serious population decline, estimated to be more than 30% over the last three generations (approximately 18 years), inferred from over-exploitation, shrinkage in distribution, and habitat destruction and degradation. Although there was no direct data available regarding recent declining population rates, the above-mentioned rate of decline seemed reasonable based on the high levels of harvesting and habitat loss. It should also be noted that: the last population assessment accounted for only 7,000 to 8,500 individuals living in the wild, in eastern China (Sheng 1998), though the basis for these numbers is not clear; the distribution range of the species is rather limited, and the species appears slow to colonize new areas (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Wu <em>et al.</em> 2007); threats, to the survival of the species, are in all likelihood still present (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Wu <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>The 2008 assessment considered the generation length to be approximately six years and thus the assessment window approximately 18 years. The main justification for Vulnerable seems to be based on observations of Ohtaishi and Gao (1990), Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) and Sheng (1998), which are outside or nearly outside of the <em>c. </em>18 year assessment window.<br/><br/>However, the species is now likely to be predominantly restricted to protected areas, in several of which it appears to be relatively common (see Population below). Whilst hunting rates in eastern China in general appear to be relatively moderate, and in some protected areas potentially very low. <br/><br/>Here we assume that the situation remains similar to that in 2008, there is no information that suggests the situation has worsened, but a thorough re-evaluation of the species’ status is required, specifically assessment of the rate of habitat loss during the assessment window, and determination of the scale of muntjac population decline and hunting intensity.","This species occurs mostly in heavily forested mountain areas, with abundant undergrowth (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990), as well as mixed forest and scrub (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi, East China Normal University pers. comm. to R. B. Harris). In Wuyishan NNR the species was detected from elevations above 1,000 m (Songlin Cheng pers. comm. 2014). The species appears to be a generalist browser/frugivore, its diet includes a wide variety of tree leaves and twigs, forbs, grasses, and fruits (Harris 2008). Zheng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006) found that most sign of <em>M. crinifrons</em> in a study area in Suichang county, Zhejiang province was found in mixed forests, although conifer forests increased in importance during winter. <em>M. crinifrons </em>seemed to prefer relatively high tree canopy cover in relatively high elevation (&gt; 800 m) zones with little human disturbance. They apparently display rather limited dispersal capability (Wu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, 2006, 2007).<br/><br/>The reproductive cycle is aseasonal, and some females conceive new litters while still lactating (Harris 2008). Young are born throughout the year (Harris 2008). Gestation is 210 days, and mothers give birth to single fawns (Harris 2008). Sexual maturity is reached at one year (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993).","The 2008 assessment (Harris 2008) considered that the species was declining due to deforestation, expanding agriculture, hunting, and other human disturbances, however very little justification was provided. The species is hunted for venison and skin (Harris 2008). Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) reported that 500 animals were being killed annually for skins which were sold to local markets during the 1980s. Sheng (1998) reported that yearly harvest may have exceeded this figure. <br/><br/>Although there is chronic poaching throughout China, hunting pressure within <em>M. crinifrons</em> range is likely to be considerably lower than in the ‘tropical’ southwestern provinces. There is still hunting but local residents in general don’t go all out in hunting remnant wildlife, and in recent years following gun confiscation and a better economy, the more resilient species like small carnivores and muntjac are probably on the recovery in many areas (P. L. Chan pers. comm. 2014). Specifically on the basis of survey work in two sites in southern (unprotected;<em> M. crinifrons</em> possibly present; close to Huangshan) and northern&#160; (protected; <em>M. crinifrons </em>absent) Anhui hunting occurs but does not seem to be a serious problem; contrasting markedly with fieldwork sites in southwesternmost China where hunting is so intense that extirpations of many species have occurred and densities of all large bodied mammals are extremely low (Lau <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, P. L. Chan pers. comm. 2014). There is also relatively little original habitat left in the Black Muntjac range and they appear to utilise secondary vegetation as long as hunting is controlled. Furthermore probably a majority of remaining occupied habitat now lies within protected areas, and probably an even higher proportion of the remaining Black Muntjac<em><em>.</em></em> Habitat loss may no longer be a significant threat, as in some remote hilly areas agricultural and other anthropogenic landuses are being abandoned and forest is recovering, whilst still in easily accessible low-lying areas remaining forested habitat patches are slowly being developed as towns expand (P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014). But few deer are likely to persist in habitat patches at lower elevations.<br/><br/>Protected areas in Eastern China appear to be better managed than those in the southwest, (perhaps also helped by local communities that do not have a strong hunting culture), further suggesting that Black Muntjac maybe relatively secure in several areas. Hunting pressure within Tongbashan NR, Huanggangshan NR, and Yangjifeng NR is not very serious (Jianhuan YANG pers. comm. 2014). Published studies from Gutianshan and Jiulongshan Nature Reserves (see population above) also suggest that Black Muntjac is relatively secure within them. The population in Wuyishan National Nature Reserve is considered to be secure (Songlin Cheng pers. comm. 2014).","This species is currently considered endemic to southeastern China, and is now restricted to several mountain ranges, largely as a result of extensive deforestation, fragmentation and degradation of natural habitats at lower elevations in combination with associated hunting pressure.<br/><br/>In 1989 the total Chinese population was estimated around 5,000-6,000 individuals by Ohtaishi and Gao (1990); Sheng (1998) estimated the population to number approximately 7,000 to 8,500. However, the basis for these population estimates is not known. Hunting and habitat destruction have negatively affected its geographic distribution and abundance (Sheng 1998). A possible decrease in numbers during the late eighties was inferred by Ohtaishi and Gao (1990). The species is believed to be in decline because of hunting and habitat loss.<br/><br/>In at least two protected areas Gutianshan and Jiulongshan Nature Reserves the species appears numerous enough to support ecological (Zheng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, 2007; Chen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010; Zhang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010) and population genetic studies (Cheng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008b, Wang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012) based on field signs and camera-trapping (Zhang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Furthermore for both these protected areas Bao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006) appear not to mention hunting as a threat, suggesting that habitat loss and degradation is the main cause of population decline and that there is a “big threat from human activities, especially tourism development”. The results of Cheng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2008b) imply that the species still persists in small ‘isolated’ habitat fragments on the edge of both these nature reserves; if hunting were a serious issue in these reserves it is hard to understand persistence in isolated fragments.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, in Wuyishan National Nature Reserve the species appears to be detected by sight not uncommonly (Cheng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012); in five days V. Dinets <em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em> (2014) saw and videoed a single <em>M. crinifron</em>s and observed no evidence of hunting; in two days ‘birding’ a single was seen (TropicalBirding.com: trip report 2013 “SE China and Tibet (Qinghai)”). In Wuyishan NNR the species was first detected in 2010 and appears to be distributed in three main areas, Huanggangshan, Dushujian and Qixingshan, all at relatively high elevations (Cheng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, 2013; Songlin Cheng pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>If the population estimates of Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) and Sheng (1998) were accurate and the species is still present and obviously numerous in several protected areas at present, then it seems unlikely that the species has undergone a decline equivalent to Vulnerable; so either the population estimates were relatively inaccurate, the population has not declined substantially, or perhaps there has been subsequent population recovery in some areas.<br/><br/>Among the three main distribution centers of this species in eastern China there has developed a degree of genetic differentiation that Wu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006) attributed to the reduction of female-mediated gene flow stemming from habitat fragmentation. Although Wu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2007) found a comfortingly large degree of nuclear genetic diversity; they nevertheless confirmed the earlier conclusions of Wu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005, 2006) based on mtDNA that the species had been fragmented into subpopulations. Given that the mountain ranges to which the species is now restricted have been ecologically isolated by agriculture and other anthropogenic land uses probably for decades, the genetic results are not at all surprising.",Decreasing,"This species is now restricted to eastern China (in southeastern Anhui, northern Fujian, northeastern Jiangxi, and western Zhejiang (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Wu <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), with a few outlying records from eastern Zhejiang.

22164089,18848,Pudu puda,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-01-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Southern Pudu is a small sized deer endemic to the South American Temperate forests (Jiménez 2010). This deer was previously listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd+3cd (Jiménez and Ramilo 2008). The population of this species is inferred to have declined as native forest (its primary habitat) has declined almost 50% in the last 500 years (Lara <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). In the last 12-15 years (3 generations) the species has probably declined up to 20% due to the combination of forest loss, predation by domestic dogs and other threats, and is expected to continue declining. In this scenario, the Southern Pudu would be close to meeting criterion A2cde+3cde. The extent of occurrence of the species is much larger than 20,000 km² (see Pavéz-Fox and Estay 2016), and although population size is unknown, it is suspected to be larger than 10,000 individuals. Therefore, since the Southern Pudu does not meet the criteria for Vulnerable but is close to meeting criterion A, it is listed as Near Threatened.","The Southern Pudu occurs between the sea level and 1,700 m (Miller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1973, Jiménez 2010). Pudus can use both mature and disturbed forests (Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Jiménez 2010), and are associated to dense understory (Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Meier and Merino 2007, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012). In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Pudu uses primary and secondary evergreen forest, eucalyptus plantations (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012) and alerce (<em>Fitzroya cupressoides</em>) forests (Silva-Rodríguez pers. obs.) whereas in other areas it is associated to dense Chusquea sp. bamboos (Jiménez pers. obs.). In Argentina, Meier and Merino (2007) reported the presence of Pudu in <em>Nothofagus dombeyi</em> forests and was associated to dense understory. Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (1987) reported home-ranges between 10.2 and 26.1 ha. Pudus are considered solitary deer, although home-range overlapping occurs (Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Jiménez 2010).","The species has likely experienced important declines over historical time. Nearly half of the native forests in the Valdivian Ecoregion in Chile (35º-43º30’) were lost between 1550 and 2007 (Lara <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). This area comprise most of Pudu distribution. Forest loss has been more severe in the northern part of Pudu distribution. For example, in coastal areas of the Maule region 67% of forest was lost between 1975 and 2000 (Echeverría <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). In La Araucanía, deforestation rates have reached 2.9% for the period 1999-2008, rates that are higher than in previous periods (Miranda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Deforestation rates are lower (but still important) from Los Rios to the south. Lara <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) reported that 66% and 74% of the forest present in 1550 was extant in Los Rios and Los Lagos, respectively in 2007. For coastal forests of Los Ríos region, net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (Zamorano-Elgueta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). According to Echeverría <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), in three areas of Los Lagos region forest loss occurred at annual rates of 1% (northern Chiloé, 1985-2007), 1% (Maullín, 1985-2007) and 0.8% (Rupanco, 1986-2006). Forest lost is often replaced by exotic tree plantations (e.g., Echeverría <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Miranda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pudus can use plantations if there is dense understory (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Simonetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). However, considering that the final destiny is exploitation, plantations should be—at best—considered poor quality habitat.<br/><br/>Attacks by domestic dogs are a common threat. Dogs are associated to human houses (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) and roads (Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Moreira-Arce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Dog attacks on Pudu occurs in multiple areas (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, 2012, Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), even within national parks (Chang Reissig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), and is a frequent reason for Pudu admission to rescue centers (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving (2012) reported that the probability of Pudu presence was higher in areas with lower probability of dog presence. Similar scenarios may occur in other areas such as Chiloé (J. Jiménez, pers. obs.). The importance of dogs as a threat is expected to be critical in fragmented landscapes, where the area free of dog influence may be small (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012).<br/><br/>Invasive deer and wild boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) are present in part of Pudu distribution (Meier and Merino 2007), whereas cattle is widespread (e.g., Meier and Merino 2007, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Within Pudu distribution, non-native herbivores lead to habitat degradation, affecting understory (e.g., Veblen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989, 1992; Raffele <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and forest regeneration (Zamorano-Elgueta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The potential ability of these invasive species to occupy and modify diverse habitats (Barrios and Ballari 2012) might affect the distribution of Pudu (Meier and Merino 2007). The presence of cattle-related pathogens has been documented in Pudu (e.g., pestivirus, Pizarro-Lucero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005;<em> Mycobacterium avium</em> subsp. <em>paratuberculosis</em>, (Salgado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015)), although the significance of these findings for Pudu populations in the wild is unclear. Wild boar could eventually prey on Pudu fawns, but to our knowledge this has not been documented.<br/><br/>Roads are an additional threat that deserves attention. Animals are in occassion hit by cars (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) even inside protected areas (Pastore and Ramilo pers. obs., Jiménez pers. obs.) and highways could be a barrier to movement, although this has not been tested. However, roads and road development is a concern because of the indirect effects associated. Roads facilitate the movement of dogs (Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), one of the key threats for Pudus and land-cover change often occurs associated to roads (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In Chile, the projected bridge between Chiloé and mainland deserves attention, as it may connect Chiloé and mainland populations (that present genetic and morphological differences, see Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011) and may facilitate the invasion by carnivores that are native in mainland, but absent from Chiloé, such as foxes and pumas. Thus, road development cannot be seen simply as animals killed by cars, but as an important driver of other threats.","Up to recently, total population was thought to be less than 10,000 animals (e.g., Wemmer 1998, Jiménez and Ramilo 2008, Jiménez 2010), however there are no field data-based estimations (Jiménez 2010). Pudus are abundant in Chiloé (Jiménez 2010), and are frequently detected in camera traps in the Coastal Range of Los Ríos and Los Lagos regions (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Silva-Rodríguez pers. obs., A. Farías pers. com.) as well as in the coastal forests of the Nahuelbuta range (Jiménez pers. obs.). In the Central Valley of the Araucania region Pudus are very rare, nearly absent, whereas in the Andes of the same region it is considered rare but its presence is associated with riparian vegetation of major rivers and native forest within small valleys that surround protected areas (N. Gálvez pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Simonetti and Mella (1997) estimated that the area needed to sustain a population of 500 Pudus (assuming 100% suitable habitat) would range between 79 and 128 km². Following the same reasoning and assuming that 10% of the native forest was occupied by Pudu, the area needed to sustain 10,000 Pudus would range betwen 15,800 and 25,600 km² of native forest. Remaining forests between Maule and Los Lagos in Chile (35º-43º30’S) cover an area of approximately 57,626 km² (Lara <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012), therefore the Pudu population is likely to exceed the 10,000 figure in this area (that represents a portion of its distribution). Although there is no data on population trends, population is suspected to be declining as a result of forest loss and degradation, predation by domestic dogs, as well as potential impacts from other alien species and poaching (Jiménez and Ramilo 2008, Jiménez 2010; see Threats).",Decreasing,"The Southern Pudu occurs in southern Chile and southwestern Argentina from 35º10’ to 46º45’S (Jiménez 2010). In Chile, recent records within this range include Trehualemu at the coastal range of the Maule region (Simonetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012), Nahuelbuta Mountain Range, Puyehue, Perez-Rosales and Chiloé National Park (Jiménez pers. obs.) and Huinay, Palena (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In southern Chile, Pudus are also commonly recorded in Puma <em>(Puma concolor) </em>scats (Rau and Jiménez 2002). In Argentina, 54 localities have been recorded (Pastore 2004, Meier and Merino 2007) between Lago Quillén, Lanín NP (39º23’ S, 71º17’ W) and Arroyo Pirámide, Los Alerces NP (42º58’S, 72º00’W). The extent of occurrence of this species is much larger than 20,000 km² (see Pavez-Fox and Estay 2016).","Pudu poaching still occurs in some areas (Jiménez 2010, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). However, attitudes towards Pudu seem to be positive at least in the Valdivian Coastal Range (Stowhas 2012), Chiloé (Jiménez pers. comm.) and the Maulino forests (Zorondo-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). This suggest that poaching could be less common than before, at least in these areas. In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Pudus are often saved by people from dog attacks (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012). In Argentina, poaching has not been documented in recent years (Ramilo 2001, Meier and Merino 2007). However, in other areas poaching for subsistence purposes occurs (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Jiménez 2010), and in some cases poaching is the final result of a dog attack (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Poaching for (illegal) commercial purposes as well as to supply private collections is likely to occur. During the 1980’s over 600 Pudus were captured in Chiloe island (Astorga 1987 as cited in Jiménez 1995) and between 1985-1993 42 animals were legally exported from Chile (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The current magnitude of poaching for commercial purposes is unknown, but it is suspected that the captive population is supplemented with wild animals (Jiménez 2010).",Terrestrial,"<u>Conservation actions in place</u><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. Hunting is illegal in all the territory of Argentina (Law 22.421) and Chile (D.S. Nº 5/1998 MINAGRI). The Southern Pudu is listed as vulnerable in Chile (D.S. 151/2007 MINSEGPRES). Also, it is considered as a “Special Value Species” in Argentinean national parks where the species is present (Res. 284/91).<br/><br/>There is a large number of protected areas within Pudu distribution, and Pudu is known to be present in many of them (Jiménez 2010). In Argentina, 98% of localities recorded are located within national parks (Pastore 2004). A high proportion of the protected areas within the distribution of Pudu in Chile are larger than the minimum needed to sustain 500 individuals (Simonetti and Mella 1997). In addition, in Chile there are several private protected areas within Pudu distribution (Maule to Aysen, e.g., Valdivian Coastal Reserve, Tantauco, Pumalin, etc.), that as a whole, protect several hundreds thousands of hectares (see Praus <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Pudu is a conservation target for the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Delgado 2005, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). In this area, monitoring is in place, and different strategies such as promoting better care of dogs, forest restoration and cattle management are in different stages of implementation (Silva-Rodríguez, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Finally, there is an important stock of Pudus in captivity. There is an international studbook for the species that, between 1966 and 2013, had registered 1159 individuals, including 122 animals that were alive (May 2013) in 40 different institutions (Stadler and Aurich 2013). In February 2016 there were 136 Pudus registered in the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS) (International Species Information System&#160; 2016). In addition, captive Pudus in Chile were estimated in 295 (Jiménez 2010). The captive stock has allowed to conduct a large number of studies on the biology (especially reproductive biology) of the species (e.g., Reyes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1988, Bubenik <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000,&#160; Stadler and Aurich 2015, see review in Jiménez 2010).<br/><u><br/>Important conservation actions needed</u><br/>As stated above there is a large number of protected areas within the distribution of the Pudu. However, there are some key issues that may affect the effectiveness of these areas in Chile. First, there is an important gap between the funds needed to manage adequately the protected areas and the funds available (Ladrón de Guevara <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Consequently, adequate funding for protected areas is a fundamental issue to address. Second, private protected areas are important, but currently lack a normative framework (Praus <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), and consequently, securing the long term conservation of private protected areas is an important challenge.<br/><br/>Efforts to address the dog problem are being implemented in both Argentina’s (Pastore pers. obs.) and Chile’s Protected Areas System (CONAF 2015), through regulations that limits the entrance of dogs into officially protected areas. However, there is still an impact by dogs from the surrounding areas (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012), therefore limiting the ranging behavior of local dogs is fundamental but at the same time challenging due to the important roles that dogs play for rural households (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). These measures, need to be supported by better nation-wide policies on dog-ownership and responsibility.<br/><br/>Rehabilitated, rescued and confiscated Pudus are often released, but this management has been innefective in the coastal range as released individuals are quickly killed by pumas (A. Aleuy pers. comm.). Additionally, the release is a concern (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, 2015), because released animals may represent a risk for the receptor population if protocols are inadequate. Animals should not be translocated between mainland and Chiloé because they present important genetic and morphological differences (Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Following international standards (e.g., IUCN 2000) for the release (or not) of the rehabilitated animals is fundamental and animals that can not be released could be allocated to environmental education (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/><u>Research needed</u><br/>Pudu conservation has been limited by the fact that up to recently most information available was anecdotal (Jiménez 2010). In recent years, this has began to change (e.g., Meier and Merino 2007, Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012). However, and despite major advances, still there are no estimates of Pudu population size or density. This major gap requires urgent attention.<br/><br/>There has been recent advances in the understanding of some of the threats that affect Pudu, including exotic plantations (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Simonetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and domestic dogs (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010; Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, 2012; Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). However, there are still very important gaps in understanding. First, recent evidence suggest that the presence of native understory is a key factor explaining the use of exotic plantation by forest mammals, including Pudu (Simonetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), however it is unclear how the long-term management of plantations (including clearcuts), affect or will affect Pudu. Second, Pumas, the main native Pudu predator, commonly prey on invasive species such as the European hare (<em>Lepus europaeus</em>) (Rau and Jiménez 2002). This alternate prey may keep high puma population that in turn may prey on Pudus (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, Jiménez per. obs.). Third, the potential impact of wild boar on Southern Pudu habitat need to be clarified as this invasive species might affect the distribution of Pudu (Meier and Merino 2007). Forth, the potential effect of cattle-related pathogens on Pudu, such as pestivirus (Pizarro-Lucero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) and <em>Mycobacterium avium </em>subsp. <em>paratuberculosis </em>(Salgado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), is unknown and should be elucidated by further research. Fifth, it is important to determine whether poaching for commercial or subsistence purposes is a threat for some of the populations of this species. Finally, there are multiple threats, so assessing their relative importance (and the contexts in which they become important) is fundamental (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2011) suggested that Chiloé and mainland Pudu populations were different Evolutionary Significant Units. The authors proposed nomenclature for potential subspecies, however D’Elia (2012) indicated that minimum criteria to establish the new nomenclature was not met. Whether populations from Chiloé should be named as a different subspecies or not, is still waiting for an answer.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22164644,136290,Mazama temama,Data Deficient,,2016,2015-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Data Deficient due to ongoing uncertainty in its taxonomy, distribution, habitat and threats. This species is probably threatened, however, the degree to which is unclear. Until there is some knowledge of what the range of the taxa is in relation to <em>M. americana</em> and where the species remains within the known range, then it is not possible to apply the Red List Categories and Criteria. There is growing concern as to the effects of the numerous possible threats to this species - in some regions it remains only in protected areas while in others is seems to survive outside of protected areas. Hunting could be a serious threat and therefore until the limits to the distribution are better defined it is not possible to say the extent and effect of the threats. <br/><br/>In recent years information has been generated regarding its abundance and/or distribution; however, there is a lack of information regarding these aspects within its entire distribution range. It is a species that is found in preserved tropical rainforest areas but has also been recorded in areas with secondary vegetation. The extent of disturbance to which these species can adapt is not known with certainty, but there are records of sites with large cropland and pasture areas where the presence of this species is low or not present at all. It is unknown whether this species’ density is naturally low or if there are factors that cause these reductions. Mexico has records of hunting as a means of population control since this species is a bean cultivation plague; moreover, its abundance and distribution have been reduced in some areas within the southeast part of Mexico due to catastrophic events such as forest fires.","The Brocket Deer is considered characteristic of well-preserved high forest sites (Branan and Marchinton 1985, Eisenberg 1989). It occupies perennial forest, cloud forest, sub-perennial forest and low-dry forest (Reyna-Hurtado 2002, Ivan-Lira and Naranjo-Piñera 2003). It can, however, be found at transformed sites such as secondary forests and cropland as well (Bodmer 1989, Bello 2004), but in some conserved areas it avoids deforested areas and agricultural vegetation types (Weber 2005). During three years of camera-trapping in the Cordillera Talamanca region in Costa Rica - the species was found in a variety of native (but not altered) forest and non forest habitats, and from lowlands to paramo (2,800 m asl) (J. Schipper unpublished data). In areas with high hunting intensity, brocket deer also use low flooded forest (Reyna-Hurtado 2002). Its preference for well-preserved sites seems to be a protective strategy, as deer can stand still and hide in thick vegetation when a predator approaches, or run through it without being easily caught (Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997). Further research is needed to determine the degree of disturbance and isolation of the fragments that they inhabit.","Habitat fragmentation and degradations for agricultural and livestock activities is one of the principal factors in the reduction of their potential habitats and distribution. This also includes natural disasters such as wildfire (Bello 2004). Hunting is a major threat in some areas - especially in and around protected areas. Harvesting for cultural activities, and principally as a food source, could influence their population levels and behaviour (Reyna-Hurtado 2002). Another threat that has existed for a long time is their killing as a pest control in bean croplands (Méndez-Izquierdo and Bello-Gutiérrez 2005).","Total populations are unknown. There is some information about density but only at local level abundance for Mexico. Including Protected Areas, the estimates were of 0.09 deer/km² in tropical forest (including <em>M. Pandora</em>) (Weber 2005), in cloud forest the estimate was 0.32 individuals/km² (Lira-Torres and Naranjo-Piñera 2003). No reliable estimates exist for Nicaragua, Honduras or Colombia.",Decreasing,"Very little is known of the actual distribution and range limits for the Central American Red Brocket. It is presumed to occur in southern México, North and central Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, and extend into western Colombia.

Further field and genetic reserach are required to determine where <em>M. temama</em> seperates from <em>M. americana</em> and vice versa.","Harvesting for cultural activities, and principally as a food source  could influence their populations levels and behaviour (Reyna-Hurtado  2002).",Terrestrial,"The species is listed in CITES Appendix III for Guatemala as <em>M. temama cerasina</em>.<br/>Recommended conservation actions are: further information about habitat status, distribution and abundance, ecological research; study about their importance for human community as uses and harvest levels and their cultural relevance; implementation of management plans and legislations at international and national level.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22165292,136551,Muntiacus vaginalis,Least Concern,,2016,2015-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Northern Red Muntjac are still widespread and common in much of South and South-east Asia, occur in many protected areas, and are resilient to habitat change and hunting. Populations in Pakistan and Bangladesh appear to be severely reduced, however. It is subject to intense trade-driven hunting in parts of its geographic range (particularly east of the Mekong) which are resulting in densities well below carrying capacity. There are thus regional variations in population trend. In Vietnam, Laos and parts of China declines probably have exceeded 30% in the last three generations (10–15 years) and on current trends can be confidently expected to do so in the next three generations in at least Laos and Vietnam and probably also Cambodia (reflecting major habitat fragmentation which compounds the effects of hunting). Future trends in China may be complex as recovery may be occurring in some areas (e.g. Hong Kong), whilst in others the population may be so small and restricted to remote and or nominally protected areas that the numbers of animals remaining to be hunted become a relatively small proportion of the total. The trend in Myanmar is clearly decreasing although the magnitude remains uncertain, but land clearance and protected area management there appears to be following a trajectory similar to that in Laos and Vietnam, albeit lagging behind by perhaps about a decade. On balance the large range in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Thailand, probably greater than 50% of the species' geographic range, and enormous total population of these countries in only shallow decline, mean that the global population is unlikely to be declining overall (past present or future) at rates sufficient to warrant listing as even Near Threatened.","The Northern Red Muntjac inhabits a wide variety of forests and scrub, including level plains and rugged mountains, dense and open forests, evergreen and deciduous areas, old-growth and secondary forests, and even grass- and cropland near woody habitats, from sea-level commonly up to about 1,500 m asl and occasionally over, perhaps with some variation regionally (Blanford 1891, Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004). Within this broad habitat use, densities doubtless vary based on conditions. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that signs, and presumably animals, were significantly more common in lower- than higher-lying areas of the Tenasserim–Dawna mountains, Thailand, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities. Population densities in Thailand are substantially higher in deciduous forest than in evergreen forest (Steinmetz and Mather 1996, Steinmetz<em> <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2010). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), <em>M. vaginalis</em> frequently exploits grass- and herb-dominated environments, linked to highly logged locations, and with a preference for lower altitudes (although they did not specify what altitude range was covered, nor discuss the possibility that because logging tends to occur in valley bottoms and lower hills rather than on steep hills and ridges, a preference for lower altitudes could simply be a consequential effect of a preference for logged areas. Teng <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Hainan, muntjacs preferred shrub grassland and thorny shrubland, used dry savanna in proportion to its availability, and avoided woods, cultivated grass-plot, and deciduous monsoon forests. Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) attributed the apparent stability in numbers of the Chinese population to logging activities, which were bringing about an increase of secondary forest and scrub dominated areas. A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Red Muntjac more widely than any other herbivorous mammal, including in coffee areas far from the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Its diet is based on fallen fruits, buds, small seeds, twigs, seed pods, tender leaves, and young grass (Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species has been cited as a major dispersal agent of fruit-producing plants in southern China (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001) and Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1977) and this is presumably so throughout its range.<br/><br/>In much of its range (although rather less than was popularly supposed until recently) this is the only muntjac species. Where congeners occur, it is widely sympatric, evidently even syntopic, with them, there is no solid evidence for competitive exclusion except perhaps at very high altitudes. Where it overlaps with Fea’s Muntjac <em>M. feae</em> in Thailand, Red clearly predominates in more deciduous habitats and lower altitudes, with Fea’s apparently more common in high altitudes and fully evergreen forest (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). It probably occurs throughout the range of Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (e.g. Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1998). There is extensive overlap with muntjacs of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex (<em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, <em>M. puhoatensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em>), but there may be areas above about 1,500 m asl where the latter greatly outnumber <em>M. vaginalis</em> and some where <em>M. vaginalis</em> is absent (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on examination of numerous camera-trap photographs from many camera-trap programmes). Camera-trap results from northern Myanmar suggest that Red Muntjac occurs largely below the altitudinal range of <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, but fully through the range of <em>M. putaoensis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004), however, reported many <em>M. vaginalis</em> at high altitudes in Arunachal Pradesh, with one direct sighting at 3,000 m asl near Tawang, and there may therefore be significant local variation in the upper altitudinal limit. Two specimens in the Natural History Museum, London from Nepal have recorded altitudes of 11,400 and 8,500 feet (3,450 and 2,590 m asl) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping in Bhutan has recorded the species relatively commonly between 2000 and 3650 m, over essentially the full elevation range surveyed, where this may be the only muntjac species present (K. Vernes, S. Dorji and R. Rajaratnam based on unpublished data pers. comm. 2014, photos seen by R.J. Timmins 2014).<br/><br/>Northern Red Muntjac appears to be able to breed all year around, although the existence of well-defined breeding seasons has been suggested for some populations, particularly in those inhabiting locations with a more seasonal climate (Barrette 1977, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001). In any case, ""peaks"" of mating activity are present, at least, in some areas (Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, Roberts 1977). Despite only a single fawn being born each occasion, overall lifetime output is high (Barrette 2004). Even where births occur throughout the year, there is still a fairly rigid cycle of antler formation and shedding, synchronised at the population level (Barrette 1977, Mishra 1982, Acharjyo and Patnaik 1984). It tends to be solitary (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Seidensticker 1976, Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Barrette 2004), reports of small groups could be attributed to mating pairs or to female/offspring units, or to temporary incidental proximity of individuals at concentrations of high-value food, e.g. fallen fruit under a tree (Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Individuals seem strongly attached to a certain home range, but there is no convincing evidence of territoriality (Barrette 1977, 2004). Northern Red Muntjac is diurnal in some areas, nocturnal in others (Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977) and is probably best regarded as crepuscular. It is an important prey for Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Tiger <em>P. tigris</em>, and Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>.","Northern Red Muntjac are hunted widely, both legally and illegally, over most of its range (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Madhusudan and Karanth 2002, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Hansel 2004, Kaul <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kumara and Singh 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008), and it is probably among the most used and most desired wild meats in South and South-east Asia (e.g. Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Patterns of threat vary across the species' range. Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas where mammal hunting has been heaviest. In its mainland China range, rates may be even higher, because a recent fire-arm ban is said to have pushed up levels of gin-trapping (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and <em>Aquilaria</em> resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 90 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing muntjacs set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per square kilometre per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Viet Namese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins in press b, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hunting intensity had in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing (Timmins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008), as of 2014 there are indications that hunting intensity has reached equivalent levels to the north, at least in some areas (Timmins in press a). In northern Thailand when muntjacs become rare, the animals are hunted in group drives, the meat is often sold (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002).<br/><br/>Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in Indochina have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Field survey encounter rates with Northern Red Muntjacs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Cambodia are remarkably low compared with other areas in its range (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In a recent reconnaissance survey of highly fragmented habitat in southern Lao PDR (Pathoumphon district, Champasak province), outside the protected area system, muntjac were the only ungulates (assumed to relate to this species on habitat and distribution) for which signs were commonly found, even wild pigs <em>Sus</em> sp(p). being noticeably more scarce (K. Khounboline and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). This pattern is general throughout Lao PDR (K. Khounboline pers. comm. 2008). However, areas of heavy hunting have lost muntjacs or had them reduced to extreme rarity, not only forest isolates such as Houay Nhang (a few square kilometres,, just outside Vientiane, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994) but also, where hunting has been extremely heavy, less fragmented landscapes (such as the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area in south Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In such areas, even though forest within them is in general heavily degraded, habitat is unlikely to be the prime cause of decline, because in some other areas of long-standing forest devastation now dominated by a mix of secondary ruderals, shrubs and grasses, muntjacs are still relatively common, e.g. <em>Phongsali</em> (far northern Lao PDR), where they can even still be heard from the provincial capital town (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005). Similarly, Red Muntjac is common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape (Chek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008), and studies in Hainan indicated selection of openings and other edge habitats rather than forest interiors (Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004), this seems generally true throughout South-east Asia (R.J. Timmins and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). There is also evidence from elsewhere in its range that this species is better able than most ungulates to withstand a certain degree of continuous harvesting as well as habitat disturbance (Jathanna <em>et al</em> 2003), although this has rarely been based on quantified status assessment. In Nagarahole National Park, India, Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) found no difference in muntjac abundance between a heavily hunted and a lightly hunted site, compared with enormous differences for most other ungulates. In the context of Indochina, even their heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, from based on visit and discussion). Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) cautioned against assuming that these results indicated an intrinsic resilience to hunting by this muntjac: it is not so readily hunted as, for example, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, because of its solitary nature, affinity for dense cover and therefore risks of getting caught are higher when using appropriate techniques to kill or capture it. However, the ubiquitous disparity in status between <em>M. vaginalis</em> and other ungulates (and indeed almost all other mammals of similar or larger body weight) in Indochina indicates that it is truly much more resilient to hunting. Muntjac populations are capable of recovering quickly from overexploitation if hunting is controlled: an overhunted, low density population freed from hunting pressure in Thailand increased 10-fold in 6 years, a rate of increase that is likely near the biological maximum attainable by the species (Steinmetz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2010). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting, muntjacs (most or all were presumably <em>M. vaginalis</em>) fell in the fifth tier, persisting much longer than all other ruminants and with only species like squirrels, civets, and linsangs being placed later in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Even so, villagers reported that muntjacs were greatly reduced in numbers in the area. The strongest demonstration of its remarkable resilience is that it is now common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels. Red Muntjac were reduced to very low populations a few decades ago, but did not become extinct, and has increased rapidly in recent years (Shek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>While wild meat is the major driver of South-east Asian muntjac trade, parts such as antlers are also heavily traded (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001).<br/><br/>Rapid economic development and expanding wealth in the species' range, particularly South-east Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. Similarly, in Thailand, trade-driven hunting has been the main cause of muntjac and other wildlife population declines, regardless of protected area status (Steinmetz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2006). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Wild meat is chosen in preference to farmed meat despite a greater price per unit weight (e.g. Hansel 2004). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em>.<br/><br/>Thus, even though this is one of the most resilient of large mammals in Indochina persisting in fragmented landscapes and often in peripheral forest areas, populations in Indochina (Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia) are likely to be declining significantly (perhaps at a level to trigger VU i.e. 30% in 10–15 years, for the regional population) (Timmins<em> <em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2008). Densities especially in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are generally well below carrying capacity, although in extensive areas of Cambodia are likely to be more natural, as they are across the range west of the Mekong (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Since 2008 rates of decline in Indochina have almost certainly increased and are now quite likely to be in the region of ‘30% in 10–15 years’, especially in Lao and Cambodia where economic growth has seen widespread landscape level changes in infrastructure and land use and concomitant rise in the value of bushmeat and in hunting pressure, although most areas in Vietnam may have already been so depleted prior to 2008 that hunting of residual animals has been relatively difficult since then, thus tempering decline rates, even though hunting intensity has probably increased (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).","This adaptable and widespread species remains locally common in most of its range (e.g. Whitehead 1993, Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lynam 2003, Johnsingh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Polet and Ling 2004, Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008), even in Hong Kong, an almost totally deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels (R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008, Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). About 20–30 individuals were estimated by Roberts (1977, based on a 1972 estimate) for Margalla National Park in northern Pakistan, this would account for most of the population surviving in that country at the time. In Bangladesh the species is the most widespread wild ungulate, more widely distributed even than wild hogs. However, the population is declining and the species is nowhere very common. It is a rare species with only a small population in the Sundarbans which constitutes half of the remaining forests of Bangladesh, but it is uncommon to rare in the remaining hill forest areas of northeast and southeast of the country (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008, Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014), this reflects “rampant...forest destruction” during the British colonial era which was, if anything, even worse after independence (Khan 2003). Hunting is the main current threat, rather than habitat loss as it is a well-adapted species. Even so, muntjacs (assumed to be this species) can still be seen readily in the north-east (P.M. Thompson pers. comm. 2008). In the southeast in the Chittagong Hill Tracts muntjacs were detected in all of 38 surveyed grid cells (each 10,000 ha and &gt;50% forest cover) during a camera-trapping survey in 2010-2011, suggesting occupancy of essentially all remaining suitable habitat patches (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). The species’ status in China is somewhat clouded by the overlap in range with<em> M. reevesi</em> (as well potentially as other muntjac species), both species have mapped ranges in eastern Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, southern Hunan and southern Jiangxi and possibly western Fujian (Zhang <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Corbet and Hill 1992). In some areas camera-trap pictures of these two species may be very difficult to tell apart (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). For instance there was much uncertainty about the identity of animals in Hong Kong with thoughts that perhaps only <em>M. reevesi </em>occured (Shek 2006), however camera-trapping surveys recently concluded that <em>M. vaginalis</em> [as <em>M. muntjak s.l.</em>] was the only species present (Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), but further investigation is warranted as although some animals do appear to be diagnosable as <em>M. vaginalis</em>, some other captive animals at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden and a photo of a female in Shek (2006) show character combinations that make firm diagnosis as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or <em>M. reevesi </em>impossible, suggesting perhaps introgression (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007) note significant differences in general pelage of muntjac in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong muntjac populations would appear to be stable and “very common”, having increased from a low point at some point in the past (Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Pei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Population status of muntjacs is presumed to be worst in the southern provinces especially Guangxi, Guangdong, but it is currently unclear whether there are differences in status between <em>M. vaginalis</em> and <em>M. reevesi</em> in these provinces. On the basis of recent surveys using multiple methods including camera-trapping (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) muntjacs (species uncertain) remain relatively widespread and appear to persist in most reasonably sized areas of suitable habitat in Guangxi, Guangdong and southern Jiangxi where hunting pressure is extremely high and populations of almost all large mammals are severely depressed or extirpated (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2014). However at a site based level muntjac in these provinces are notably scarcer than in Hong Kong, based on encounter rates of calls, faeces and camera-trap photographs, this is attributed by rural hunters to recent very heavy hunting with gin-traps precipitated by a fire-arm ban (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Status appears to be similar in Hainan, where <em>M. vaginalis</em> is currently the only known species, and hunting pressure is high (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2014), although in some well protected areas the species appears to be abundant with incredibly high densities reported (e.g. 54 animals/km²: Teng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, such high densities are clearly unnatural and suggest either methodological error or peculiar ecological circumstances).<br/>Although Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) stated that the total Chinese population of <em>M. vaginalis</em> [as <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em>] was about 500,000, the assumptions behind such a number were not explicit and it should be treated with great caution. Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) estimated that a total of 30,000 individuals were harvested each year on Hainan Island alone. <br/><br/>Populations are certainly also declining in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam, through heavy trade-driven hunting (see threats). Muntjacs in a number of Thai protected areas are increasing (Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press) so the era of widespread population decline in Thailand might have largely ended, as few are likely to remain outside of protected areas. ‘Red’ muntjacs are common in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand (Ngoprasert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), but this is within the main transition zone between Sundaic and northern taxa, so the species there is/are unknown. Populations in Nepal are thought to be relatively stable (Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). Muntjac in deciduous forests in western Thailand attain densities of 2.1–3.1 individuals/km² (Srikosamatara, 1993, Steinmetz and Mather, 1996, Sukmasuang, 2001). Densities are 2.2/km² in the deciduous forests of eastern Cambodia (Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). The following densities have been estimated in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 3.64 +/- 0.63 (SE) per km² (Jathanna <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003), Kanha moist deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 6 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 0.7 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 0.9 animals per km² (Karanth and Kumar 2005), Melghat dry deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km² (Karanth and Kumar 2005), Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, 2.5 animals per km² (Barrette 1977), Karnali-Bardia, Nepal, 1.7 animals per km² (Dinerstein 1987), and Rajaji National Park, 1 animal per km² (A.J.T. Johnsingh pers. comm. to Barrette 2004). Where studied, population densities are always well below those of herding ungulates (previous citations), but this is not so in areas where hunting has perverted ratios, where Northern Red Muntjac may even be the only deer species remaining.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Sri Lanka, most of India, northern Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and southern China, including Hainan and southern Tibet, and into southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia) south to the northern part of the Thai–Malay peninsula (Roberts 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990, Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992, Wang Ying-xiang 2002, Groves 2003, Grubb 2005). The precise southern range limit remains unclear on the Thai–Malay peninsula (see Taxonomy). It has been introduced in the Andaman Islands (Corbet and Hill 1992). It is widespread in most range states, except Pakistan (see Population).","This species is widely traded and hunted in China and Southeast Asian countries. China appears to be a major consumer and producer of&#160;<em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em>&#160;products. There is an intense commercial activity of this species from bordering Southeast Asian countries into China which involves meat, hides and medicinal products. (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Zhijun&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, see also other references in General Information section).&#160;It is not usually kept as livestock.",Terrestrial,"Northern Red Muntjac occurs in many protected areas throughout its range and in most countries is covered by laws regulating hunting at some level. Across large parts of its range, the species would benefit if these national laws involving the protection of the species were more efficiently enforced, particularly those which relate to wildlife trading. Also, greater effort should be devoted to engaging local communities in the protection and recovery of wildlife populations in nearby protected areas. The proactive involvement of communities has resulted in increased population trends of muntjac and other hunted species at various sites in the region.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22166396,42189,Muntiacus atherodes,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-02-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Muntiacus atherodes </em>apparently remains widespread and at least locally common. Although data strongly suggest it is predominantly a lowland species, it occurs substantially above the level lowlands; in these latter areas the pace of forest conversion is alone sufficient to result in listing as Vulnerable or Near Threatened for forest obligates even of somewhat shorter generation lengths (see BirdLife International 2001), but this muntjac appears to have too wide an altitudinal range for this to be applied. However, forest loss even up to 750 m has been significant (probably around 15% between 2000 and 2010) and some preliminary data suggest that the species is strongly associated with gentle terrain and avoids rugged areas and steep slopes, which could mean that the loss in terms of <em>M. atherodes</em> numbers has been an even higher proportion.<br/><br/>Muntjacs are subject to intense harvesting in at least some areas of Borneo, and there is good evidence from Malaysian Borneo that this depresses population densities significantly. There is also evidence that Yellow Muntjac is more scarce in logged than in old-growth forest, in contrast to the pattern shown by sympatric <em>M. muntjak</em>. Hunting, logging and post-logging conversion to non-forest are ongoing and can be predicted to continue to reduce populations. However, this species remains common in some areas with both heavy hunting and habitat conversion. Therefore, rates of decline cannot be calculated or even easily inferred (even of muntjac spp. in general, let alone of determining whether <em>M. atherodes</em> is changing in relative frequency).<br/><br/>Concerning the appropriate red list category for this species, there was little convergence of opinion during the 2008 assessment among people surveying mammals on Borneo, except that it was unlikely to fall in any of the threatened categories. Since 2008 what data there are have leant more weight to the probability that the rate of decline could be more substantial than generally conceived; after all detecting even 20% declines in inherently ‘common’ and widespread species is likely to be very difficult on the basis of largely ‘incidental’ data. During the 2008 assessment some felt strongly that it was unlikely that Bornean Yellow Muntjac could be declining fast enough to warrant listing even as Near Threatened. However, with hindsight, it now seems also plausible that when considering potential combined impacts of forest loss, logging and hunting in light of increasing understanding of the species’ ecology, that listing as Vulnerable under scenario A2cd is conceivable. Thus, with reservations, it is listed here as Near Threatened considering that there is reasonable likelihood that declines in the past fifteen years have exceeded 20% and might even have been significantly higher, yet it is an assessment based on few precise data, at times contradictory, and which warrants review whenever a clearer picture is available.","Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (1985) stated that “available data suggests that this species predominates over the Red Muntjac in low hill ranges and coastal regions”, but Meijaard and Sheil (2008) pointed out that still “no robust quantitative data exist to support this [pattern]”. An incomplete review of altitudes associated with museum specimens by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) suggests no readily apparent difference between <em>M. atherodes</em> and <em>M. muntjak</em> in the altitudes of historically collected animals, in fact there appear to have been very few muntjacs collected at altitudes over 900 m, presumably partly reflecting the relatively small area of Borneo above such altitudes (Timmins <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> pers. comm. 2008). There is, however, an opinion by many field observers that Bornean Yellow Muntjac is genuinely absent from mountains (Timmins <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> pers. comm. 2008), yet there are specimen records from over 900 m and camera-trap records from over 1,100 m (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpub. data).<br/><br/>Based on camera-trapping undertaken between 2008 and 2010 in Sabah in three forest areas all identifiable muntjac photographs were of <em>M. atherodes</em>. The three forest areas were Deramakot (FSC certified and well managed) [below 400 m] in which there were 1,916 trap-days of effort, where muntjacs were recorded from 27 of 48 camera stations, and out of these 18 had confirmed <em>M. atherodes</em>, Tangkulap (more disturbed by conventional selective logging but logging stopped 10 years ago) [below 400 m] in which there were 2,203 trap-days of effort, where muntjacs were recorded from 6 of 64 camera stations, at all six with confirmed <em>M.</em> <em>atherodes</em>, and Segaliud Lokan (also more disturbed by conventional selective logging, only RIL logging is being continued) [below 400 m] in which there were 2,933 trap-days of effort, where muntjacs were recorded from 11 of 58 camera stations, and out of these 10 locations had confirmed <em>M. atherodes</em>. <em>M. muntjak</em> by comparison was not definitely recorded, although single individuals photographed in Deramakot might have been this species and a female and fawn in Segaliud Lokan were probably this species. All three sites are lowland forest reserves and both Deramakot and Tangkulap had high patrol effort by rangers from Sabah Forestry Department during the study, no evidence of hunting was found during the project. In Segaliud Lokan rangers reported that sometimes they encountered hunters in the forest during patrolling, although no evidence of hunting was found during the project (all information from A. Mohamed and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>It was common in Sungai Wain forest, Kalimantan, which spans 30–150 m asl, and clearly out numbers <em>M. muntjak</em> there (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008). It also seems to be the predominant species in Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, a mix of Acacia mangium plantation and natural forest, where it uses mature and immature plantation, freshly logged forest and relict tall forest, nearby it has also been found in oil palm (Belden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Since the 2008 assessment the population in this lowland area seems stable (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014). In this mosaic region the majority of camera-trap photos have come from plantation areas rather than natural forest, and although harvesting has taken place in the plantations this seems not to have affected the muntjac population (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014). In the Ulu Segama area of Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sabah, mostly at about 300 m Asl, <em>M. atherodes</em> was slightly more common than <em>M. muntjak</em> (Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs were frequently seen, suspected to comprise roughly equal numbers of the two species, in the Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, which lies mostly at 100–760 m asl (Meredith 1996). <em>M. atherodes</em> occurs down to sea-level (in e.g. Similajau National Park, Sarawak, Duckworth 1997) and up to at least 3,000 feet (approximately 900 m asl), based on specimens in the Field Museum (Chicago, USA, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Mohd Azlan J. (pers. comm. 2008) has recorded muntjacs provisionally recorded as this species in hill dipterocarp forest at both Lambir Hills National Park and Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary. Field observation suggests that it occurs naturally only below 1,000 m asl, although semi-captive individuals live as high as 3,000 m asl (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2006). Camera-trapping between 2010 and 2012, in 15 sites in Sabah and Sarawak recorded many muntjacs, based on provisional identification of the photos, it appeared that the two species may have had approximately similar abundance below <em>ca </em>300 m, but <em>M. atherodes</em> abundance declined very quickly with increasing elevation, the preliminary review of the data also suggested that <em>M. atherodes</em> abundance was lower in logged areas than in unlogged areas, while <em>M. muntjak</em> abundance was not discernably affected by logging (Brodie unpublished data, J. Brodie in litt. 2014).<br/><br/>Preliminary camera-trapping results from nine different forest reserves and protected areas across Sabah found high naive occupancy results for Yellow Muntjac from lowland sites, but low occupancy at highland sites, however the highest detections were from over 1,100 m (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It uses both primary and secondary forest (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), although no specific information is available on its tolerance to severe degradation and fragmentation. Preliminary analysis of muntjac records from camera-trapping between 2010 and 2012, in eight sites in Sabah and Sarawak, suggest the species might have lower abundance in newly logged forest, whilst <em>M. muntjak</em> abundance potentially was higher, compared with unlogged forest (Brodie unpublished data, J. Brodie in litt. 2014). Preliminary results from 9 different forest reserves and protected areas across Sabah also suggest Yellow Muntjac may be negatively affected by logging whilst Red Muntjac may be less affected (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpub. data). Presumably <em>M. atherodes</em> cannot survive complete forest conversion, but this has not been demonstrated or even, it seems, specifically investigated.<br/><br/>Its diet includes herbs, seeds, grass and fruits (Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). It is mostly active during the daytime (Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985, Yasuma and Abdullah 1997, Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) but at least sometimes at night (Duckworth 1997). It lives in small territories and moves either in pairs or alone (Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). Breeding seasonality is unknown.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread on Borneo. Indeed, they are often associated and all the island’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Hunting is for meat, medicine and hides.<br/><br/>The extent to which habitat encroachment and hunting constitute threats specifically to <em>M. atherodes</em> is unclear, reflecting a paucity of studies to determine its resilience. Logging has been reported to lead to slight decreases in densities of the species, and this seems to be due to habitat change per se rather than elevated hunting (which usually accompanies logging; Bennett and Gumal 2001) because <em>M. muntjak</em> in the same study was found to increase strongly after logging (Heydon 1994). In the Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, Sarawak, muntjacs (probably mostly this species) are among the commonest species camera-trapped in young <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations (under four years old) and have been seen browsing on young acacia shoots. Footprints are common in the adjacent newly planted areas and forest fragments (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). However, this area contains a substantial proportion of natural, if somewhat degraded, forest, which in theory might be found to be necessary for populations in the highly altered habitats. Information on the species in landscape-scale plantations has not been traced. In terms of coping with fragmentation, <em>M. atherodes</em> has survived at least for several years in several forest isolates of 100 km² or less, Similajau National Park (Sarawak; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. based on observations in 2005), Sepilok Forest Reserve (only 42 km²; muntjacs not confirmed as this species; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008), and Sungai Wain (Kalimantan; G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008); in the latter, where there is little hunting except around the margins, it is common. But the current carving up of the formerly extensive forest of lowland Borneo is so recent that determining long-term persistence in such fragments is impossible; doomed populations in slow but fixed decline may account for records in fragmented and degraded areas. There is no good evidence that any muntjac is tied to old-growth forest, however, even in areas where two or more species are sympatric (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Muntjacs are widely and heavily hunted on Borneo for meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000; Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008; Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008; G. M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008; A. C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunting used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G. M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008). The combination of dogs and guns may be particularly efficient (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy for the region (although bears no comparison to the extremely intensive snaring levels found for instance in Vietnam, outside well-secured areas, but at least in some areas seems not to catch many of this species: Belden Giman (pers. comm. 2008) found during interviews with 75 longhouses inside the Sarawak Planted Forests (Bintulu) that the highest percentage (73% and 12%) of game species caught by snares were pigs and porcupines respectively; muntjacs (both species) totalled less than 2% of animals, even though in this area they are common. Shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000; Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Unaccompanied packs of stray or even perhaps feral dogs are also likely to be a threat, particularly in forest isolates close to urban areas (e.g. Similajau National Park; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely that hunters make any distinction between the two Bornean muntjac species directly, although it is plausible that <em>M. atherodes</em> is under higher hunting pressure than is <em>M. muntjak</em> reflecting its purported predominance in the lowlands, where most of the logging concessions currently lie. Plantation estates are also concentrated in the lowlands, but Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) found that hunting levels in them were low, not least because they supported so few animals that would-be hunters preferred to journey to forest areas. Even when these were nearby, few labourers were hunting, because of the demands of their job, and, crucially, the disincentives by plantations companies for them to own shotguns. As non-locals with limited financial security, most followed employer rules preventing ownership of guns. Experience elsewhere shows that in such situations, local hunters may see such concentrations of labourers as potential markets, therefore leading to an increase in hunting even though it is not undertaken directly by the labourers. As plantations cover ever more Bornean lowlands, this may become a more significant stimulant of hunting. Also, although some ethnic groups, at least the Punan, have traditional beliefs against eating muntjac meat (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: muntjacs (along with Bearded Pig <em>Sus barbatus</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>) are heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 250 muntjacs were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and in the 1990s was probably expanding. There were, then, no controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species (including muntjacs). The implementation of the Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Substantial numbers of muntjacs are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo.<br/><br/>Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon muntjacs (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Muntjacs constituted only 4–11% of animals killed, but index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. Since that study, much forest has been converted and muntjac populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be more vulnerable to local extinctions.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop of evidence for widespread hunting of muntjacs, the <em>M. atherodes</em> population in Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division appears to have been stable between 2008 and 2014 despite some ongoing illegal hunting; in this area pigs <em>Sus </em>and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor </em>appear to be the primary quarry (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014).","This species appears to be widespread and often common throughout its range, wherever appropriate habitat occurs (Yasuma and Abdullah 1997, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2006; see further discussion in the Habitats and Ecology section). Numbers seem to be in some decline in the Indonesian part of Borneo (Semiadi 2006). They may also be in decline in Malaysian Borneo (Bennett <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000), although this study did not distinguish the two species of muntjac. Around the Bintulu lowlands the species remains common despite major habitat disruption and high levels of hunting relative to the region (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Forest loss on Borneo below 750 m has been calculated as <em>ca</em> 16.5% between 2000 and 2010, this figure includes both peat swamp and mangrove forest where percentage losses have been higher than other forest types (derived for Borneo from Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), however it seems likely that in forest types used by <em>M. atherodes</em> the loss has been over 10% and likely even over 15% (A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014). However there is evidence from at least one area that the species is able to use plantation forests (see the Habitats and Ecology section), which could mean that the percentage population decrease of <em>M. atherodes</em> below 750 m as a result of forest loss is somewhat less than the percentage loss of forest would suggest. Evidence from at least two separate studies suggests (see the Habitat and Ecology section) that significant population decline occurs during intensive logging operations, and that significant population depression continues for years after logging has ceased. Suggesting that even in remaining forests below 750 m [Between 1973 and 2010 an estimated 37.8 % of forest has been lost and an additional 34% of forests below 500m have been logged in some way (Gaveau <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014)] significant population declines have taken place. Hunting has been considered a significant issue for the species in many lowland areas, both logged and unlogged (see the Threats section) and this has undoubtedly resulted in further population reductions above and beyond those simply resulting from habitat changes as a result of logging or forest loss.<br/><br/>Estimating the true population reduction over <em>ca </em>the last 15 years (assuming a generation length of <em>ca </em>5 years) is extremely difficult, however a suspected decline of 20-25% seems quite plausible, in view of the likelihood that the species has a predominantly lowland distribution and favours gentle terrain (see the Habitat and Ecology section).",Decreasing,"This species occurs only on Borneo, and lives throughout the island; many specific localities are given in Groves and Grubb (1982). No information was traced concerning its presence in Brunei but presumably it lives there. It is present in both Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak). The Bornean Yellow Muntjac is known from most of the forest protected areas in Sarawak, including Bako National Park, Lanjak-Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, Similajau National Park, Lambir Hills National Park, Samunsam National Park, Gunung Gading National Park (in the lowland part), Mulu and Niah National Park, and has also been recorded in logged forest in the Bintulu area and in oil palm adjacent to recently logged forest in north-east of Bintulu (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008).","The Bornean Yellow Muntjac is hunted for&#160;meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies. It is not usually kept as livestock.",Terrestrial,"Yellow Muntjac is known from many protected areas in Malaysia and Indonesia. Protected area coverage in the lowland plains is still relatively limited in Borneo, and many areas are, in terms of forest ungulate protection, sufficiently small (under 100 sq. km) that long-term persistence cannot be assumed; most places will require continuous hands-on activities against poaching. Even protected areas are not securing lowland forest on current trends, at least in some parts of Borneo: Curran <em>et al</em>. (2004) demonstrated substantial loss of lowland forest within protected areas of Indonesian Borneo. Indonesian forestry law protects all species of muntjac (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Heavy hunting with shotguns was found to be a severe problem for larger mammals and birds across Sarawak and the need for its control (of guns and of sale of ammunition, with firm legal underpinnings) was recognised in the Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996). As everywhere, people devise ways for circumventing the controls (illegal trade in bullets and locally made shot-guns, called bekakok, which have no administrative or legal paper-trail) and strong enforcement is required for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>The long-term persistence of large populations of Bornean Yellow Muntjac, as distinct from isolated populations in well-secured protected areas, will depend upon their ability to use plantation landscapes of oil palm, rubber, acacia and others. Clarification of this is needed to assess the species’s conservation priorities. Of particular concern is the finding from Sabah suggesting that <em>M. atherodes</em> may be more a species of old-growth forest and <em>M. muntjak</em> the predominant species of logged areas (Heydon 1994). It is urgent to determine whether this is a generally applicable pattern across Borneo.<br/><br/>Close liaison with plantation estates and other employers of large numbers of labourers is essential as this offers the best medium to control hunting by employees. As the proportion of plantation rises this will become ever more important. Similar arrangements are needed with logging concession-holders, even more importantly because of the high hunting levels by and/for loggers. <br/><br/>In future studies, ways of enhancing information specific to muntjac species need to be sought and implemented. Many of the studies reviewed here would not, for example, have detected wild changes in the relative proportions of the two muntjac species within their results concerning muntjac spp. This is a major concern, given that <em>M. atherodes</em> is likely to be most everywhere sympatric with <em>M. muntjak</em>. With cheap digital cameras now available, some form of photography, by the hunter, of each animal killed should be considered (and this would be beneficial for other Bornean genera with closely similar species, e.g. chevrotains <em>Tragulus</em>). Most of the grey literature was not available to the present review and much could be learnt from a more comprehensive trawl of it and of active surveyors.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22167140,29742,Rangifer tarandus,Vulnerable,A2a,2016,2015-12-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In 2015, <em>Rangifer </em>tarandus is categorized as Vulnerable A2a due to an observed 40% decline over three generations (about 21-27 years) across the circum-Arctic countries, when <em>Rangifer </em>declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410 individuals. Uncertainty is high about the extent of the decline and the under-lying mechanisms except at a general level. Extent and causes of the decline vary with region and subspecies. Causes of declines include habitat changes, which do not appear reversible within three generations. <br/><br/>The species is largely migratory and gregarious and is thus susceptible to declines as a result of landscape changes, including the establishment of barriers (related to human activities and infrastructure development), which can disrupt migration routes and destroy seasonal habitat. Unregulated hunting, time lags in management and habitat alteration leading to habitat loss, fragmentation, and changes in predation are mechanisms for declines. Furthermore a warming climate will have complex and interacting effects and concerns are strong about a warmer climate exacerbating effects of disease and parasites including the possibility of epidemics. Additionally, despite monitoring, uncertainty remains about abundance and trends as well as trends in habitat loss which suggests the observed declines in <em>Rangifer </em>abundance and habitat may continue over a further three generations.","<em>Rangifer </em>occupy a number of habitats from continental coastal plains to mountain ranges and Arctic islands, spanning high Arctic to Boreal forest. The Arctic island tundra habitats include high Arctic polar desert to semi-moist dwarf shrub tundra. The low-lying coastal plains on continental North America and Russia vary from narrow coastal strips of tundra to large low-lying extent of tussock and non-tussock graminoid tundra. The tree line transition zone also varies in width depending on elevation and climate and separates the tundra from the Boreal forests. In mountainous regions, elevation determines the level of the tree line and the transition between coniferous forest and montane tundra. Along the rugged southwestern coast of Greenland, the tundra is a relatively narrow vegetated band separated by deep fiords or glaciers reaching the coast. <br/><br/><em>Rangifer </em>is a generalist herbivore with a diet dominated by lichens, forbs, sedges, grasses and shrubs. Foraging is seasonally selective and focused on individual plant species and selecting flower buds and unfolding leaves to maximize nutritional value (Russell <em>et al.</em> 1993). Winter diet is often largely lichens, which may occur as thick mats in many boreal coniferous forests. <em>Rangifer </em>is unusual among large-bodied herbivores as it can exploit lichens which, although high in digestible carbohydrates, are low in protein (Russell <em>et al.</em> 1993). Lichens are slow-growing and are periodically unavailable for decades after fires sweep through the forests. Caribou tend to avoid burnt areas preferring the forests 150 to 250 years after fires (Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1998). <br/><br/><strong>Life History</strong><br/>Adult survival is typically high (80-90%), while calf survival is annually variable. The annual life-cycle starts with the cows being bred in the fall rut (September-October) and then calving in June after a gestation averaging 225–235 days (Bergerud 1975). The cow’s autumn body condition determines the age of first pregnancy and the annual likelihood that a cow will conceive. Barren-ground Caribou usually calve at 3 years of age and usually calve annually but reproductive pauses occur if a cow has not regained sufficient fat and protein reserves by the rut and thus does not conceive (Cameron 1994, Thomas and Kiliaan 1998). The climate across <em>Rangifer </em>distribution is highly seasonal, is characterized by a short snow-free plant growing season and a long winter when snow often adds to the energetic costs of moving and foraging. Climate is strongly regional and trends in climate differ across the regions (Whitfield and Russell 2005). Correspondingly, <em>Rangifer </em>have a strongly seasonal cycle of accumulating fat and protein reserves which are high prior to the rut and lowest during calving (females) and after the rut (males).<br/><br/>Caribou are relatively long-lived, with females living as long as 12–16 years, and males for a few years less (Thomas and Killiaan 1998). Single births are usual (Thomas and Killiaan 1998). The calf is able to stand within a few minutes of birth and in two to three days can keep pace with the maternal cow. Generation time, used in species assessments, is estimated at 8-9 years based on barren-ground Caribou adult survival and fecundity.<br/><br/><strong>Breeding Strategy</strong><br/>The sexes differ in body size, breeding pelage and antler size. <em>Rangifer </em>is polygynous (a male mates with more than one female) and the breeding system is thought to be a harem system. Cows have several oestrus cycles of 10-12 days (Ropstad 2000) and conceptions are highly synchronous within a herd during the four- to five-week mating season (Dauphiné and McClure 1974). Less information is recorded about the rut strategies of the forest-dwelling <em>Rangifer </em>(caribou and valentinae). Female reproductive strategies are relatively flexible with the cows trading off their survival against reproductive investment during conception, foetal growth (birth mass) or lactation. The strategy is an adaption to annual variations in energetic costs and the availability of forage. <br/><br/><strong>Movement Patterns</strong> <br/><em>Rangifer </em>characteristically is a constant migrant, the migrations from winter to calving and post-calving ranges and then from fall to winter ranges are a striking global phenomena. Migratory behavior is associated with gregariousness. Although the highly gregarious nature of the tundra herds is conspicuous, forest Reindeer is also gregarious although the numbers are less. In Finland, forest Reindeer during calving are dispersed but the Reindeer is gregarious during the rut and into winter (Miettunen 2014).<br/><br/>Abundance influences the scale of seasonal movements: when abundance is high, migration distances can be long (thousands of kms) from wintering deep in the boreal forests to calving and summering on the tundra. For some herds, calving and summer range is an Arctic island and the winter range is the neighboring continental mainland (Poole <em>et al.</em> 2010, Baskin 2005). Geographic fidelity to calving and summer ranges tends to be high both in migratory tundra Caribou and forest Reindeer (Pulliainen <em>et al.</em> 1986). When abundance is low, fall and winter ranges most often contract toward the calving and summer ranges and the length of the migration pathways is correspondingly reduced, often by hundreds of kilometres. On the arctic islands, when abundance is low, Caribou are dispersed in individual home ranges, as abundance increases, seasonal migrations increase in distance and the degree of gregariousness (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Mountain Caribou rely on migrating between lowland winter ranges to high elevation calving and summer ranges on the alpine tundra. Forest (and woodland Caribou) Reindeer are dispersed at low densities and undertake relatively small-scale seasonal migrations with selecting calving areas in boggy areas on small islands in lakes. In Greenland with its narrow coastal strip of ice-free land that is dominated by fiords and mountains, movement is restricted and generally oriented on an east-west axis.","For mountain and forest <em>Rangifer</em>, landscape changes from forestry and industrial developments especially roads and seismic lines lead to changes in vegetation and vulnerability to predation (Leblond <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Johnson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). However, despite knowing the relationship between landscape changes and predation, management is not yet effective, as declines of boreal Caribou have continued (COSEWIC 2014, Johnson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Landscape changes, especially transportation infrastructures, energy production plants and tourist resorts, often represent barriers for migrations, and are responsible for Reindeer population fragmentation in Norway (Panzacchi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a,b; 2015). Some landscape changes, include mining about which concerns are locally strong, include dust and cumulative effects. Less is known about population versus individual responses to industrial development. An exception is the Central Arctic Herd in Alaska. The western part of the calving ground has been intensively developed as oilfields with networks of roads, pipelines and drill pads. Calf body mass and survival was affected by this development (Arthur and Del Vecchio 2009), but initially the herd increased partly as a result of a trade-off between development costs in better regulated hunting.<br/><br/>Unregulated hunting and competition with domesticated Reindeer are documented threats for continental tundra Reindeer (Baskin 2005). However, mechanisms underlying widespread declines are incompletely understood, especially the role of predation, nutrition, disease and parasite interactions. <em>Rangifer </em>have been harvested for thousands of years and harvest is a part of the life and culture of northern aboriginal people. But, technology has changed hunting effort which is often uncoupled from <em>Rangifer </em>abundance leading to delays in detecting effects of unsustainable hunting. The conditions when, and if, harvesting becomes a threat are complex and although <em>Rangifer </em>is subject to management planning, the realities are that management responses are frequently hampered by mistrust of scientific data, disagreements about causes of declines, and time lags in institutional responses to implement management actions (Kolpaschikov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>Climate change is rapid in the Arctic and its effects will be complex as relative and absolute forage availability changes, the timing of snow melt, ice freeze-up and break-up changes. A detrimental effect that can change the context of other threats is changes in the frequency of rain-on-snow or other icing events (Hansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, 2014) especially on the Arctic islands. Icing events can cause widespread changes in movements and deaths especially of calves and adult bulls. A warmer climate will have complex effects on parasites (Kutz <em>et al.</em> 2014) as some are adapted to a cool climate and their development may be reduced in warmer temperatures (Hoar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Warmer temperatures will change the distribution of intermediate hosts and vectors such as mosquitoes. In Finland, recent warmer summers increased mosquito activity leading to outbreaks of Setaria in Finnish Reindeer, causing many deaths (Laaksonen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).","Overall across the circum-arctic countries, the trend is an inferred 40% decline over the previous 10-25 years, when <em>Rangifer </em>declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410. There are national, but no global, databases to assess conservation status, although the Circum-Arctic Rangifer Assessment Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) network tracks trends in migratory tundra <em>Rangifer</em>. For this IUCN assessment, we used data from journal publications, web sites, published and unpublished reports and expert knowledge. We did not use in-filling methods to bring estimates to the same reporting period as survey methodologies varied from expert opinion to ground and aerial survey-based estimates. Consequently, abundance estimates have variable measurement error (as described by, for example Baskin 2005, Cuyler 2007, Bjerketvedt <em>et al.</em> 2014). Estimates of abundance vary as to whether adults only are reported. Estimating population size is often infrequent which influences describing trends over 3 generations (21-27 years) and we were occasionally limited to assessing trend over 10 years. Generation time is estimated at 7-9 years based on barren-ground Caribou adult survival and fecundity as input to the IUCN generation length calculation which uses mean survival values (generation length = (1/mortality rate) + age at first reproduction). For subpopulations with adult survival data, a similar range of values is calculated. However, calculation of generation time is complicated (Hernandez-Suarez 2011), as it depends on the population age structure and average age.<br/><br/>As well as the 40% overall decline during the past 10-30 years, the abundance of wild Reindeer and Caribou has declined since historic times (Bergerud 1974, Syroechkovski 2000, Festa-Bianchet <em>et al.</em> 2011) especially for forest and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. In Russia, in the late 1800s, there may have been 5 million Caribou which rapidly declined to about 600,000 by about 1900 and 250,000 by the 1960s before recovering to peak in the 1990s (T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). For the continental tundra <em>Rangifer</em>, any question of historic declines is complicated by the longer-term (decadal) cycles in abundance (Meldgaard 1986, Zalatan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Joly <em>et al.</em> 2011). Generally, many continental tundra herds peaked in the 1990s then declined. The current declines are less than historic minimums for several Canadian continental tundra populations despite management actions such as hunting restrictions. In Norway, abundance has recovered since hunting caused historic declines until hunting was halted in 1902-06. However, it is uncertain if the current declines are less or similar to the historic levels. <br/><br/>Typically, declining abundance and distribution can fragment populations. However, trends in numbers of <em>Rangifer </em>populations are complicated as their definitions are not standardized. While populations (herds) are relatively easily recognized from calving and post-calving to rut movements for continental tundra and mountain Caribou, terminology is more problematic for forest Reindeer and boreal Caribou. Additionally, fragmentation and introductions have altered population numbers so any relationship between overall declines and numbers of populations is unclear. Three examples reveal the complexity. Firstly, in Norway, the two or three large historic sub-populations of mountain reindeer historically declined by the early 1900s and recovered but into a landscape increasingly fragmented by roads, railways, energy production plants and tourist resorts. The developments blocked ancient migration routes (Panzacchi <em>et al.</em> 2013a) and the former two or three populations became fragmented. <br/><br/>The second example of complexity in interpretation for trends in populations is on Canada’s island of Newfoundland, 12 natural populations were the basis for an additional 20 introduced populations (COSEWIC 2014). The third example, is in Alaska, during peak numbers, two small mountain herds ‘disappeared’ when a larger and increasing neighboring herd expanded their range and overlapped the smaller herd’s range (Harper 2013). The larger migratory tundra populations mostly persist for decades, even as their abundances increases and decreases (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/><strong>Alaska</strong>: Overall, the total number in 27 herds for coastal tundra and mountain Caribou (Harper 2013) have declined about 40% in abundance from approximately 1.1 million Caribou at the peak of herd sizes (1994±2.3SE) to 660,000 (2010±0.03SE). Currently, most (20) herds are 2,500 Caribou or less while the other 7 herds are 30,000 or more. Six of the smaller herds may have increased but uncertainty remains about the earlier estimates, three of the larger mountain herds have increased (with predator and hunting management) while three of four coastal tundra herds are declining. Most monitoring is annual for survival and productivity and frequent estimates of herd size for the larger herds. <br/><br/><strong>Canada</strong>: Overall, Caribou have declined in abundance over three generations by an average of 52% to the current (2015) estimated 1.3 million Caribou. The decline is unevenly distributed among the different types of Caribou. Monitoring boreal Caribou is mostly dependent on monitoring mortality and productivity while population abundance is directly estimated for mountain and migratory tundra caribou from sample counts during calving, post-calving or fall. However, the frequency of monitoring varies considerably. <br/><br/>Boreal Caribou have continued to decline since 2002 despite conservation efforts to mitigate the cumulative impacts of oil and gas development, forestry, and other land use activities. For 37 of 52 boreal subpopulations where trend data are available, 81% are in decline. Population surveys prior to 2002 estimated that there are 33,000 forest-dwelling caribou in the boreal population and in 2014, an ongoing decline of &gt;30% of the boreal Caribou is inferred. <br/><br/>Caribou on the island of Newfoundland declined by 68% since 2002 for the 15 natural and 22 introduced local populations. A remnant of the former southern extent of Caribou in Canada’s southeast, the Gaspésie Caribou declined further since 1950 to about 120 adults despite being in a national park and predator removal. <br/><br/>Overall for mountain Caribou, status is uncertain as trend is measured for 18 of 45 sub-populations over the last 5 years representing approximately 54% of the current population, 9 are declining and only two are increasing. Of concern is that 26 herds are &lt;500 individuals, 13 are &lt;250 and two have disappeared (COSEWIC 2014). <br/><br/>On Canada’s arctic islands, the overall trend for Peary Caribou, <em>R. t. pearyi</em>, is a decline to about 14,000 individuals by 2014 from 22,000 estimated in 1987. Historically, Peary Caribou abundance was higher being an estimated 25,845 for the High Arctic Islands in 1961 and about 18,000 for the mid-arctic islands in 1973-1980 but infrequent monitoring impedes assessing total numbers (COSEWIC 2004, SARC 2012). Peary Caribou occur as 4 populations (island groupings) one of which has essentially disappeared since the 1980s, one has declined and stabilized at low numbers while the north-western island grouping has been through two sharp declines followed by recovery. The trend for the northeastern and southeastern populations is uncertain given a low frequency of abundance estimates. An additional type of Caribou is Dolphin and Union (<em>R.t. groenlandicus </em>x<em> pearyi</em>) on the large mid-arctic island of Victoria. The population has not recovered to the abundance recorded in the early 1900s. Currently the population is stable or declining at 27,000 between 1997 and 2007 (SARC 2013, Dumond and Lee 2013). <br/><br/>Sixty percent of Canadian Caribou are barren-ground Caribou which in 2013, numbered an estimated 729,000 individuals in possibly 11 subpopulations. Six populations are regularly monitored. Since the peak in the mid-1990s, the overall decline has been approximately 45-50%, with six subpopulations having declined by 70-98% from peak populations in the mid-1990s. Caribou on Baffin Island declined from over 100,000 to about 5,000 and for the Bathurst herd in the central Arctic Canada, the decline was from 460,000 in 1986 to about 20,000 in 2015 with the decline accelerating in the later stages (SARC 2013, CBC 2015) Two of the largest herds of migratory Caribou are the woodland Caribou sub-species although they are strongly migratory with aggregated calving. The George River declined from a peak abundance of 776,000 in 1993 to 14,200 in 2014 while the Leaf River peaked at 638,000 in 2001 and had declined 32% to 430,000 by 2011 (S. Coté pers. comm. 2014) <br/><br/><strong>Greenland</strong>: <br/>The overall trend for Caribou on Greenland’s west coast for 2004-2015 is an approximate 30% decline and, conservatively, the total number of Caribou in 2015 is about 73,430 excluding three populations with feral Reindeer mixed with the Caribou (Cuyler 2004, 2015). Caribou abundance is cyclic with two cycles since 1721 with short-lived peak abundance, rapid decline and extended periods of scarcity that may last a century or more before numbers recover (Cuyler <em>et al.</em> 2011). The most recent peak may have occurred in the late 1990s but changes in census techniques obscure trends (Cuyler <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cuyler unpublished). Possible causes of the previous abrupt declines include severe weather involving the entire coast in combination with overgrazed ranges, and possibly, hunting (C. Cuyler pers. comm.). Although only the four largest populations are monitored for abundance through aerial surveys, all 11 sub-populations have annual harvest monitoring (Cuyler 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Norway</strong>: There are approximately 6,000 wild Reindeer in four populations restricted to the mountains of southern Norway (Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012, O. Strand pers. comm.). Their numbers over three generations are relatively stable based on 3 of the 4 populations which are regularly monitored through minimum counts. Also in the mountains of Norway are another 8 populations which were previously mixed with semi-domesticated reindeer and 11 populations which originated from releases of semi-domesticated reindeer (Reimers 2007, Røed 2005, Røed <em>et al.</em> 2014). The behavior and reproduction performance of the reindeer is influenced by the semi-domesticated reindeer (Reimers <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2014). Overall, the trend for all 23 populations is increasing to stable under a regulated hunting regime. In 2002, the estimated total number for all populations was 22,000-29,000 and in 2015, 33,560-34,360 (O. Strand pers. comm., Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, the populations that have been mixed with semi-domesticated reindeer and which originated from the release of semi-domesticated reindeer have not been included in the calculations of population size (nationally or globally) for this re-assessment.<br/><br/>Svalbard Reindeer <em>R. t. platyrynchus</em> numbered 10,100 individuals in 2009 (Sysselmannen på Svalbard 2009), an increase since the early 1900s. The Reindeer were hunted for 100s of years but the introduction of firearms and commercial hunting in the 1860s led to reduced numbers and local extinctions. Hunting was halted in 1925. The extent that current abundance and distribution have returned to historic levels is not reported. Recent trends are available for three of the 13 populations (Adventdalen, Reindalen ,Brøggerhalvøya) as their distribution is restricted by glaciers to peninsulas and coastal lowlands. The trend is a 65% increase in the three populations from 1,217 in 1985 to 1,871 in 2012. A fourth herd, Edgeøya (northeastern Svalbard) was last counted in 2006 (Reimers 2012) and was considered stable or decreasing (Aanes <em>et al.</em> 2003, Reimers 2012). <br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Finland</strong>: Forest Reindeer are remnant of their former numbers and distribution as the Reindeer disappeared from across central and southern Finland in the early 1900s, but re-colonized from neighboring Russia in the 1940s (http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en). Numbers increased from 1992-2001 when 1,700 forest Reindeer were counted in Kainuu, eastern Finland but subsequently declined to 800 individuals by 2014. A second Finnish population started in 1984, when 10 forest Reindeer from Kainuu were released at Suomenselkä, central Finland and increased to about 1,100 in 2014 (Miettunen 2015). The decline in Kainuu’s wild forest Reindeer since 2001 seems to have been caused by higher calf mortality from increasing numbers of wolves (Kojola <em>et al.</em> 2004), traffic accidents and movements into Russia. <br/><br/><strong>Russia</strong>: Overall, abundance in Russia has declined 21% since 1990 compared to 2015 and the recorded abundance declined from 1,050,600 to 831,500 (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). The situation is quite different from North America as there are high numbers of domesticated Reindeer. The effect of domesticated Reindeer includes increased predator control as well as poaching and loss of the domesticated Reindeer to the wild Reindeer herds (Baskin 2005, Klokov 2004, Syroechkovski 2000).<br/><br/>Historically, wild Reindeer decreased since the mid-1800s to the early 1900s from as many as 5 million to less than 1 million. Abundance fluctuated during the 20th century with a peak in the early 1990s, then abundance declined. The declines in Reindeer number were mainly connected with social and economic changes in Russia. Regional status is variable and 23 populations or regions are listed in regional red books between 2001 and 2015 as being reduced to low numbers or declining (I. Mizin pers. comm. 2015). <br/><br/>Russia has a high diversity of wild Reindeer sub-species and recent declines are especially apparent for island, forest and mountain Reindeer. One population (Nizhny Novgorod) has disappeared and 19 populations are ranked as Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Currently forest and mountain Reindeer in the Russian Plains (Karelia, Arkhangelsk, Komi and Nenets Autonomous District) are all listed in the Red Books and have declined 64% in 1991-2015 from 35,400 to 12,800 individuals while their distribution is highly fragmented and reduced.<br/><br/>The sub-species <em>R. tarandus pearsoni</em> restricted to Novaya Zemlya Island has declined 30% to 5,000 individuals but Reindeer on the other Arctic islands have declined at a higher rate (73%) from 41,000 to 11,000 individuals between 1991 and 2015 (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). In eastern Russia, <em>R. tarandus phylarchus</em> in the forests on the Kamchatka Peninsula have declined since the 1950s (Mosolov 1996) and more recently, declined about 50% from 4,500 to 2,300 (1991-2015). In the Russian Far East and Pacific coast, mountain-tundra Reindeer are stable in trend but with a risk of fragmentation into small isolated populations. In southeastern Russia, <em>R. tarandus angustirostris</em> (transbaikal slender-snouted Reindeer) is a forest Reindeer and difficult to survey, but apparently reduced to several hundred animals. <br/><br/>The most numerous sub-species are the migratory tundra Reindeer (<em>R. t. sibiricus</em>) currently numbering 626,000 individuals (North Yukutia, Yamal, and Taimyr ) which have declined. The western Siberian tundra Reindeer (Yamal) have declined from 3,000 to 2,000 between 1991 and 2015 on ranges impacted by industrial development (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). Uboni <em>et al.</em> (2015) report that Taimyr and North Yakutia (Yana-Indirka, and Sundrun) tundra Reindeer had peaked in the 1990s and then subsequently had declined 25% to 624,000 individuals, while the Lena-Olenek herd increased from 55,000 in 1985 to 90,000 in 2001. The population is heavily harvested at about 9,500-12,000 individuals per year (T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). With the collapse of the domesticated reindeer industry in Chukotka in the 1980s and 1990s, the wild Reindeer in Chukotka increased rapidly from 33,000 in 1991 to 93,700 by 2015 (Klokov 2004, I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015)<br/><br/><strong>Mongolia</strong>: Trends in abundance are unreported (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006) for <em>R. t. valentinae</em> in northern Mongolia. The limited assessments indicate fewer than 1,000 wild reindeer (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Decreasing,"<em>Rangifer </em>is widespread occurring between 50 and 81 degrees of latitude around the Arctic in the northwestern U.S., Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Finland, Russia and Mongolia. The global distribution was expanded by introducing domesticated Reindeer which became feral to Iceland, and to islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean (Kerguelen, Falkland and until recently, South Georgia Island). Greenland, Finland, Mongolia, Norway and Russia also have domesticated Reindeer which have genetically and or demographically contributed to wild Reindeer populations (Røed 2005, Røed  <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, C. Cuyler pers. comm. 2015). Those populations which include domesticated Reindeer are not included in this assessment. <br/><br/>The geographic range has contracted and become fragmented during the previous hundred years mostly due to hunting and landscape changes with increased settlement, agriculture, forestry and the introduction of Reindeer herding. Analyses of current and historic distribution are available at national scales for some countries. By the early 1900s, forest Reindeer had disappeared from Finland (<a href=""http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en"">http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en</a>) although in the 1950s, a small area was re-colonized from neighbouring Russia. In Norway, the cumulative ranges have contracted to about half the size of the historic range (Lund 2004). Russian Reindeer distribution has contracted to the north and west and become fragmented over 85% its range (Syroechkovski 2000).<br/><br/>The Canadian geographic ranges of mountain and Boreal Caribou have contracted: over the last 150 years, Boreal Caribou have been extirpated from about half of their former range: approximately 60% in Alberta, 50% in Ontario, and 40% in British Columbia (Hummel and Ray 2008, COSEWIC 2014). In eastern Canada, the current Atlantic-Gaspésie population is the remnant of a larger distribution that included much of northeastern Canada and USA but which disappeared by the early 1900s (COSEWIC 2014). For mountain Caribou in BC, by 2002, 40% of their annual range had shrunk (COSEWIC 2014).<br/><br/>Less information has been compiled regarding changes in the current historic distribution for continental tundra Caribou, and is complicated by the 40-60 year cycles of abundance with contractions and expansions of distribution. Historic declines in Alaska of the Fortymile herd between the 1920s and 1970s, led to a contraction of range size of 25%. The risk is that contraction of the historic range is relatively poorly documented and consequently the current distribution is considered ‘normal’, this could be considered an example of a shifting baseline (Pauly 1995).",Local meat consumption and hide use; some commercial use antlers.,Terrestrial,"Most <em>Rangifer </em>herds are within management or conservation plans, and the conservation status of most subspecies and populations are nationally assessed. The ratings for conservation status (nationally rated as endangered, threatened or special concern) based on designated units (Canada) or oblasts (regions in Russia) emphasize the vulnerability of woodland and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. Only 4% of continental tundra <em>Rangifer </em>and 12% of Arctic Island are included in conservation categories compared to 84% of mountain and forest Caribou. In Russia, wild Reindeer are assessed and listed by conservation status in regional Red Books. The national Committee On the Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) has assessed or re-assessed almost all Caribou for their conservation status using similar criteria as the IUCN’s (COSEWIC 2014). The assessments lead to either recovery or special management planning which includes identification and protection of critical habitat. <br/><br/>Unlike many migratory species, <em>Rangifer </em>is not a recognized species within the Convention of Migratory Species probably because few migrations cross international boundaries. Two <em>Rangifer </em>populations annually range over international boundaries between Canada and the US (Selkirk Mountain Caribou and the Porcupine herd) and international cooperation is through agreements. In Finland, forest Reindeer are listed as Near Threatened under Appendix III (Protected fauna species) of the 1979 Bern Convention (The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). The forest Reindeer in Finland seasonally move across the border with Russia and the degree of monitoring and cooperation is high (Miettunen 2015). In Norway, the 23 populations of Reindeer were collectively assessed as Least Concern in 2015 (<a href=""http://data.artsdatabanken.no/Rodliste"">http://data.artsdatabanken.no/Rodliste</a>). The US assigns Threatened status to the Selkirk Mountain Caribou although the herd is reduced to a few individuals.<br/><br/>Management systems are summarized in Klein (2005) and typically, their emphasis is on tracking population trends and vital rates and adjusting hunting for migratory tundra and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. Although many herds are monitored, lags in management actions lead to accelerated declines especially where hunting effort through technological advances is uncoupled from trends in abundance (Kolpaschikov <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bjerketvedt <em>et al.</em> 2014, Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Russia, socio-political factors have a greater effect than decadal climate patterns in shaping trends in abundance (Uboni <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Norway where the Reindeer ranges are increasingly modified, landscape management is becoming more important than reliance on harvest management (Kaltenborn <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Landscape management includes special use and protected areas and experience with their effectiveness varies. Despite progress, conservation planning has not reversed or even stemmed the landscape causes of declines (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2015). In some areas, hunting restrictions, population augmentation and predator management have taken precedence in areas where industrial land use changes continued unabated and this can lead to controversy (Brook <em>et al.</em> 2015). Protected areas such as national parks are not a complete answer to <em>Rangifer </em>conservation if they are accompanied by increasing tourism and recreational activities.<br/><br/><em>Rangifer </em>includes some of the globe’s largest and longest migrations with tens of thousands animals moving 100s of kilometres. Thus the effectiveness of protected areas in conservation will depend on planning a network of protection for annual ranges (Runge <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, current protected areas are at the scale of seasonal ranges rather than a network of land management or adequate protected areas to integrate conservation of seasonal ranges (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2014). Emphasis for migratory tundra caribou has been on protecting calving grounds as in Canada where three national parks provide year-round protection for part of the calving grounds of five herds. In Russia, the Taimyrski zapovednik established a nature reserve in 1979 which covers about 6% of the Taimyr herd’s calving areas.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22167675,4257,Rucervus duvaucelii,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2015-01-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Barasingha is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion C1 because the estimated total population lies between 3,500 and 5,100 animals (not all of which will be mature individuals) and outside of several key populations, the protection status is not secure. Thus, the species is assumed to still be in decline by at least 10% over 24 years (three generations) mostly due to habitat conversion and degradation.<br/><br/>The range is now severely fragmented and the total area of occupancy (AOO) possibly falls below 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, if areas of unsuitable habitat within protected areas supporting it are excluded. If the AOO were to be confirmed, then this species may also qualify as Vulnerable based on criterion B2. However, no substantive new information was received in 2014 to enable a full reassessment of this species.&#160;This species is reliant upon hands-on management in protected areas and changes in management style could see a resumption of very rapid declines echoing those of the mid-twentieth century.","Habitat use differs between Barasingha populations, and is reflected in hoof morphology. Central Indian animals (<em>R. d. branderi</em>) occupy open sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>) forest with a grass understorey and grass glades; northern animals (<em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em>) are obligate grassland forms, true Swamp Deer, inhabiting flooded tall grassland (Dunbar Brander 1927, Pocock 1943, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), and, in Bangladesh, formerly, around mangroves of the Sundarbans (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Barasingha is predominantly a grazer (the main forage species are given in Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004), but at least <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> is known to feed occasionally on aquatic plants (C.D. Schaaf pers. comm. 1990), and aquatic plants contribute significantly to the diet of <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> during the monsoon and winter (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>The animals disperse in the wet season and congregate in large herds during the dry season, often in response to new growth following fire and the need for drinking water (Henshaw 1991, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004 and references therein). These seasonal movements take animals outside protected areas in at least Dudhwa and Kaziranga (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Dudhwa, mean group sizes during summer, monsoon and winter were 32, 13 and seven respectively; congregations of up to 250 individuals have been seen (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994). The composite home range of herds ranges from 10 to 30 km<sup>2</sup> annually (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>The Barasingha is polygynous: males and females have a linear hierarchy and during the rut males tend to defend females in oestrous (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1985, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Mating in <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. branderi</em> occurs during winter; most of the stags are in hard antler by September and they start calling by then. Calling peaks during mid October to November, but occurs within mid August–mid April. As the season progresses, the evening calling peak shifts to morning (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Rutting starts for <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> in August–September, for <em>R. d. branderi</em> in early December and for <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> in April; antler shedding begins by mid January, late April and early October respectively for the three races; fawning peaks in July–August, September-October, and March-April respectively for the three races (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2005 and references therein). There is strong fidelity to rutting sites and animals continue to visit those amid cultivation (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>The Barasingha is monoestrous and monotochus (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Females reproduce at the age of two to three years and males older than four years contribute to breeding (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Gestation lasts 240–250 days (Asdell 1964). The sex ratio in all three subspecies ranged from 40–80 stags per 100 hinds (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Sankaran 1989, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). The low male to female ratio reflects selective predation and poaching (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Barasingha females, including the two-year-olds, have reproductive rates of 20–45 fawns per 100 hinds (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Sankaran 1989, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Barasingha mortality is largely by predation, flooding (for <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. ranjitsinhii</em>) and poaching. Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> is a major predator of Barasingha, there are reports of kills by Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> and Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em> (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Golden Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em> predation on fawns and yearlings was reported by Singh (1985) and Schaff (1978).<br/><br/>Ecology and behaviour have been studied in several populations; Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004) gives an overview of information to date.","It is likely that Barasingha always had a patchy distribution, reflecting the available suitable habitat, and thus was predisposed to local extermination (Groves 1982). In aggregate, habitat conversion has led to its loss from most of its ancestral range. High levels of malaria discouraged settlement, agriculture and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape until recently. The conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India] and the [human] population is growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile terai plains have been taken over by agriculture."" (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004: 32). Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary (203 km<sup>2</sup>) is one of the few remnants of terai habitat in India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). This deer's habitat is now reduced to isolated fragments as a result of agricultural encroachment and the destruction through habitat conversion of wetlands; the wet grasslands were seen as useless areas (they were termed ‘blanks’). Conversion took place largely during the 1930s–1960s (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Isolation into small, fragmented, populations increases the likelihood of localised extinctions, including those through chance events such as extreme weather and disease, as well as compounding the effects of ‘situation-normal’ threats like hunting.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation is still problematic within protected areas supporting Barasingha. Grass, timber and fuelwood cutting by local people degrade the surviving habitat, which lies mostly within protected areas, and external threats include change in river dynamics due to human developmental activities, increase in siltation and reduced flow of water during critical periods of summer. Protected area management practices are sometimes questionable, e.g. the current practice of grassland burning to control woody succession needs to be done in form of a mosaic, and harrowing should be discouraged as it seems to deteriorate grassland condition and promote occupation by unpalatable grass species like <em>Cymbopogon</em> spp. Many grasslands and woodlands have weed infestation (e.g. <em>Sesbania</em> spp.); manual weed removal in Dudhwa and Kaziranga yielded good results for habitat of Barasingha (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2004). Although there seems to be no direct analysis of the effect of domestic stock grazing on this deer, in other wild ungulate communities studied in India they cause a major depression of densities of grazing species (e.g. Madhusudan 2004), and pending direct data, this should be assumed to be the case with Barasingha. Barasingha populations recovered in parts of North and Central India once grazing by domestic stock was controlled (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Serious efforts remain necessary to control grazing in Hastinapur, Jhilmil tal and Katerniaghat (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The grasslands and wetlands of the Terai arc landscape and the obligate species that they support, even those within protected areas are besieged by a multitude of threats which synergistically bode badly for the future (see also Red List accounts for Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Great Indian Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>).<br/><br/>Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Chital <em>A. axis</em> (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.). Particularly in Bangladesh, hunting seems to have been responsible for national extinction because the Sundarbans mangrove forest is still extensive (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It is likely to remain a highly significant threat for populations outside well-secured protected areas.","The present distribution of the Barasingha is much reduced and fragmented, reflecting major losses in the 1930s–1960s through conversion of large tracts of grassland to cropland and through barely-restrained hunting (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/><br/>The northern subspecies <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> is the most numerous of the three races, with an estimated wild population is of 1,800–2,400 in India and 1,650–1,800 in Nepal (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004; Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, NTNC, <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) reported <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> from 15 localities in India of which 11 were in Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, three in Assam and one in West Bengal. At present <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> exists in only six localities in Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, two in Assam and none in West Bengal. In Nepal, out of four localities reported by Schaller (1967) only two now hold the species. Holloway (1973) reported a locality additional to Schaller’s, the Katerniaghat Sanctuary in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh. According to Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004), using data largely from Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995), <em>R. d. duvacelii</em> is restricted to Jhilmil tal Wildlife Conservation Reserve (Uttaranchal; no estimate), Hastinapur Sanctuary; Bijnor Forest Divison; Pilibhit Forest Divison (50–90 animals in the early 1990s, about 50 a decade later, centred on the Lagga Bagga forest block of Mahof and Mala ranges; Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; but a population of about 300 in Lagga Bagga reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Kishanpur Sanctuary (about 400 in the early 1990s, Qureshi and Sawarkar 1994; and still “considerable numbers” a decade later, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; a population of 600 reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Dudhwa National Park, Kheri District (a decline from 1,200–1,500 in 1976 to about 700 by 1993, but still excellent habitat; Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; a population of 600 reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Katerniaghat Sanctuary (10–25 animals in the early 1990s) (all in Uttar Pradesh) in India. There is also a population of over 100 Barasinghas in a small conservation reserve called Tatwala in Hardwar district; this habitat and population is totally isolated from other Barasingha populations (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). A small population was discovered in Uttarakhand state in 2005 in Jhilmil Jheel, an (37 km<sup>2</sup>) area of Reserve Forest.&#160;It persists at two sites in Nepal, Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and Karnali–Bardia Reserve. At the former there was an increase from around 900 in 1976 to around 1,850 animals in 1993 (Henshaw 1993), and since then relative stability: the minimum estimate in a count in April 2007 was of 1,674 animals, making this the largest single population in the world of the subspecies (Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, NTNC, <em>in litt</em>. 2008). In 2014, the Swamp Deer population was estimated at 2,301 (H. Baral pers. comm., based on data from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation). At Karnali–Bardia Reserve, at least 34 animals were thought to be present, an increase from six in 1977, by Bauer (1990); during 1995–1996, Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral (<em>in litt</em>. 2008) recorded about 73 animals in the park. Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated 50–100 animals. Since the assessments of Schaller (1967) populations have apparently gone from Banke Division and Chitawan Division (both Nepal); Jaulasal Sanctuary; Lalkua Sanctuary; Maldhan Sanctuary; along the river Ganges, west of Handpur; between Hardwar and Luksor; Sonaripur Sanctuary; South Kheri Forest Division; Bahdi Tal, six miles west of Bellerain; Ghola and surrounding tracts; Mirchia, bordering Nepal; Jaldapara Sanctuary and surroundings (all India) (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further details of the Indian population of <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em>, estimated to total 3,500–4,000, are summarized in Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995); no more recent synthesis was traced.<br/><br/><em>Rucervus duvaucelii ranjitsinhi</em> is only found in Assam: Kaziranga National Park may have held about 750 animals in 1984, but this had declined to 350–500 by 1994 (Choudhury 1987; Qureshi and Sawarkar 1994). These numbers were not based on methods which quantify confidence in the proposed population size; the first-ever rigorous estimates came from Karanth and Nichols (2000) who recorded a population density of 14 animals per km<sup>2</sup> during their surveys in 1996 in Kaziranga National Park. The current status in Manas Tiger Reserve is uncertain (although it reportedly still occurs; B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and the species is extinct in Darang Division along the Bhutan border (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em><em>&#160;branderi</em> survives only in Kanha Tiger Reseve (Madhya Pradesh): the population peaked at an estimated 500 in 1988, an increase from a count of 66 in 1966 (Khajuria and Sinha 1986, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 1995, Karanth and Nichols (2000) estimated population density of three per km<sup>2</sup> in Kanha National Park. In 2004, the population was thought to number 300–350 (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Other populations had become extinct since the 1960s in Motinala and Karanjia ranges, Mandla District; Balaghat District between Baihar and Lamba; near Amarkantak, Bilaspur District; near Kota, Bilaspur District; Madhya Pradesh-Orissa border Raipur District; West Bastar Division near Tekemeta; West Bastar Division near Kutru in Toynar and Bhairamgarh Range (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004; some different locality names were used in Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>In 1992 there were approximately 50 individuals in five Indian zoos and 300 in various zoos in North America and Europe (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004)",Decreasing,"The Barasingha is currently found in isolated localities in north and central India, and southwestern Nepal. It is extinct in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Into the early twentieth century, the Barasingha was widely distributed in areas of suitable habitat throughout the Indo–Gangetic plain and the lowlands flanking the southern Himalaya. The range formerly extended eastward across the terai of southern Nepal through the Sundarbans as far as Assam. Barasingha occurred west to the River Indus, into Pakistan, and as far south as the River Godavari area of east-central India (Schaller 1967, Groves 1982, Sankaran 1989). The only known population in Bangladesh was in the Sundarbans, where it has been extinct for perhaps a century. The species may also have been in the northeast of Bangladesh, given its distribution in adjacent India (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Groves (1982) defined three subspecies with distributions (from Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004) as follows:<br/><ul><li><em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> (G. Cuvier, 1823) (Wetland Barasingha): Indo-Gangetic plain, north of the Ganges: Nepal, India, and, where extinct, Pakistan.</li><li><em>R. d. branderi</em> Pocock, 1943 (Hard-ground Barasingha): central India, between the rivers Ganges and Godavari.</li><li><em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> (Groves, 1982) (Eastern Barasingha): Brahmaputra plain; probably disjunct from the nominate for a very long time (Groves 1982): India and, where extinct, Bangladesh.</li></ul>","Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer&#160;<em>Axis porcinus</em>&#160;and Chital&#160;<em>A. axis</em>&#160;(Qureshi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed on CITES – Appendix I<em></em>. It is a Schedule I species under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004) and it is protected under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Swamp Deer is one of 27 mammal species strictly protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (1973) of Nepal. A PHVA (Population and Habitat Viability Assessment) workshop was conducted at the Wildlife Institute of India in July 1995. In 1995 there were 74 (25:34:15) individuals of <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> in 10 Indian zoos (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). <br/><br/>Protected areas form the cornerstone of protecting Barasingha, given its attachment to level, well-watered areas, i.e. those perfect for agriculture. This makes for challenging conservation: “Controlling human disturbance on Lagga Bagga [Pilhibit Forest Division, Terai Arc Landscape, India] is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder. Intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area” (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Lagga Bagga was recently accorded protected area status, as a tiger reserve (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Lagga Bagga and Kishanpur protected areas are connected by the Pilibhit Forest Division although Barasingha habitat is not contiguous (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Dudhwa is also close by, and Lagga Bagga is adjacent to Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve of Nepal. These four areas in total hold most of the remaining <em>R. d. duvauvcelii</em>. Not surprisingly, few Barasingha herds now exist outside protected areas; in the Terai Arc Landscape of northern India, Hog Deer and Barasingha had the highest proportions (of all ungulates studied) of their regional populations within protected areas (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Remaining populations outside protected areas seem to be small, scattered, and facing a number of threats difficult to resolve; probably these should be seen as of lower priority than ensuring the persistence of populations within protected areas, but a rigorous assessment of this is needed.<br/><br/>Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995) recommended conservation actions which can, over a decade later, be boiled down to maintaining the integrity of the protected areas supporting key populations, with particular attention to:<br/><ol><li>Curb poaching. The species does not have a high international trade value so poaching must tackled at least partly by and through local communities.</li><li>Curb habitat degradation through further fragmentation and over-harvest of plant material from protected habitat.</li><li>Develop long-term conservation management security for those areas where significant numbers disperse seasonally out of existing protected areas into surrounding farmland.</li><li>Maintain appropriate burning regimes and other active habitat-management measures.</li><li>Reduce and eventually cease grazing of domestic stock within protected areas.</li></ol>All these five issues should be addressed through effectively formulated and implemented protected area-specific management plans, reflecting the fragmented present distribution, the negligible likelihood of ever rejoining populations and that the threats have local causes and thus locally appropriate solutions. Given the wide range of possible threats and, in particular, the apparent necessity for active management of habitats (as well as control of human behaviour), management plans are particularly important to ensure a cohesive approach to conservation of Barasingha within the ecosystem of each protected area. Management plans have been prepared for various protected areas but their current status is not documented here.<br/><br/>One of the subspecies is down to a single herd, and another to just two herds. This makes extinction for a variety of unpredictable factors (e.g. weather, disease) a possibility. Establishment of additional populations of each of these forms a priority (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Patches of suitable habitat remain for each form, from which the species has been hunted out and which could, if hunting can be prevented, serve as suitable release areas. Captive breeding is often mentioned as being important for this species, but its conservation benefit is not clear. Each subspecies has protected areas which have–in the nick of time for two subspecies–secured buoyant populations. To expand beyond these, those protected areas retaining the species but not functioning so effectively need strengthening to allow natural recruitment. Establishment of additional herds of the two races down to a single site could be supported by translocations from each one’s sole current herd.<br/><br/>There are ongoing plans in Nepal to translocate some of the deer from Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve to boost the smaller population of Bardia National Park. The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation is also looking at the feasibility of re-introducing the species to Chitwan National Park. Swamp Deer was extirpated from Chitwan National Park during the 1960s, possibly due to a combination of factors (e.g. poaching, disease and habitat loss). The re-introduction programme will follow IUCN guidelines and ensure that in case of a catastrophic event in Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, good numbers are also stocked in other protected areas where the species occurred in the recent past or still occurrs in small numbers.<br/><br/>In Kanha National Park, conservation activities have included dispersal of Tigers <em>Panthera tigris</em> away from main grazing areas, control of poaching, cessation of grass burning, creation of water reservoirs, and reduction in domestic cattle numbers (Khajuria and Sinha 1986). Out-migration of villages from the park has significantly extended Barasingha habitat and protected their traditional fawning and rutting grounds (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994). Another park, Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, has been enlarged from about 155 km<sup>2</sup> to some 305 km<sup>2</sup>.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

In Venezuela and the Brazilian Pantanal, the species breeds throughout the year, usually with a single breeding cycle. Gestation lasts up to 120 days after which an average of 3.5 young are born (range, one to seven), the peak birth period is during February in the Brazilian Pantanal (Eisenberg and Redford 1999).

Siberian marmots are a keystone species in the communities they inhabit, living in large colonies. The Tarbagan Marmot resembles the Bobak Marmot of eastern Europe and central Asia in mode of life and habits.  Marmots of all ages forage on grasses, but also on 10-15 species of herbs and a few woody plants such as sagebrush.  Autumn hibernation is initiated in September, but is influenced by summer food conditions and fall weather.  Both Bobak and Tarbagan marmots hibernate in groups from 5-20 in a single burrow.  Enemies include wolves, red foxes, and several species of large eagles and hawks.  The Tarbagan Marmot may carry and transmit bubonic plague, and is therefore subject to stringent control measures in many parts of its range. Mating begins in April, after they have aroused from hibernation.  Gestation lasts 40-42 days.  Young appear above ground in June; typical litter size is 4-6, occasionally 8.  Moulting of winter hair in adults occurs about 2.5-3 weeks after the birth of young. Light brown in colouration, with dark guard hairs on the head and on the tail tip.

A Desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. <br/><br/>The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm Desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the Desman depends upon.  <br/><br/>A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian Desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced Nutria (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>) and Muskrats (<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>) may also be a threat.","At the beginning of the 1970s in the Soviet Union there were about 70,000 individuals, of which the majority occurred in Russia, with about 1,500 individuals in Kazakhstan and single records in Ukraine and Belarus. Surveys in the Russian Federation indicate that the population there declined from 39,000 in 1985 to 27,000 in 2000/2001, and this to have declined again to approximately 13,000&#160;(M. Rutovskaya pers. comm.), most likely due to the growing threats from fisheries bycatch. The surveys covered around 30,000 km of the banks of rivers, lakes and artificial reservoirs, and a uniform methodology was used (see the Biodiversity Conservation Centre website <a href=""http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html"">http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html</a> for further details). Surveys from 2009–2011 of apparently suitable habitat failed to detect any individuals in the Khopyor and Medveditsa rivers or in their tributaries and floodplain lakes. The last reliable reports of the presence of the species in theses areas were in 2004 for a tributary of the Khopyor River and in 2008 for a tributary of the Medveditsa River (Oparina <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;In Ukraine the Desman is currently very rare and in Belarus it has recently been extirpated.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan; it has recently disappeared from Belarus. At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the Desman was common in the Dnepr, Don, Volga and Ural rivers basins. Its current range is very fragmented, and it has disappeared from many areas where it formerly occurred. At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century it disappeared from Ukraine, but was reintroduced in the 1950s. In the 1990s it was found again in the Desna (a tributary of the Dnepr, Ukraine).","<em>D. moschata</em> has uses for local livelihoods.

It is generally found in pastures, prairies, and shrub habitats in lowlands and flood plains, and occasionally in true fir (<em>Abies</em>) forests (Verts and Carraway 1998). This species is common even within human-modified lands such as lawns, golf courses, cemeteries and pastures. It is primarily fossorial, though juveniles often move on the surface in spring and summer. It digs shallow foraging tunnels as well as deeper permanent tunnels. It may vacate a flooded area and return to home area when waters recede. A spherical breeding nest cavity is excavated seven to 50 cm below ground level. It contains a grass breeding nest; three to 11 lateral tunnels may enter the cavity. Mating takes place in February. One litter averaging three young is born in late March or early April. Young are hairless at birth, grow rapidly, and disperse from maternal tunnels mainly in May and June (Van Zyll de Jong 1983).

The main current threats for Manatees are hunting for meat consumption (Denkinger 2010, Brice <em>et al.</em> 2011, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sandoval 2015), entanglement in fishing nets and habitat alterations.</p>  <p><em>Illegal hunting</em>, for both subsistence and local use, is considered the main threat to Manatees in the Amazon. Manatee populations have supported a tremendous take in past centuries and, although not at commercial levels, hunting still takes place throughout the region (Barbosa <em>et al. </em>2010a, b; Franzini <em>et al. </em>2013; Silva <em>et al. </em>2014; M. Marmontel pers. obs). Most hunting is practiced with the use of traditional harpoons, but in Ecuador Manatees may be caught in traps set for <em>Arapaima</em> (Hidalgo 2010).</p>  <p>Hunters usually sell products to neighbors and nearby communities, but the meat is sometimes sold in local produce fairs or markets in the interior, or by order directly with the hunter. Public markets in Brazil (Manaus, Manacapuru, Beruri, Novo Airão, Tefé, Silves, Itapiranga, Itacoatiara, Santarém, Belém, Monte Alegre and Almeirim, Benjamin Constant, Atalaia do Norte) and Ecuador also illegally offer the meat for sale. Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place. Between 2002 and 2004, 64 Manatees were estimated to have been killed in the Amanã-Castanho area (3,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Amanã SDR (Calvimontes 2009), most of them adult males. Between 2011 and 2015, the hunt count for the same area was 42 Manatees.

Manatees are still being hunted in the river Putumayo upstream from Tarapaca and above the mouth of the Igaraparana, according to interviews with local Colombian fishermen, who say most of the hunters are Peruvian (S. Kendall pers. obs.). </p>  <p>In the Pacaya Samiria Reserve (Peru), Soto (2007) estimated an average of 35 Manatees killed in the basins of the Punahua, Ucayali and Marañon rivers.</p>  <p><strong>Incidental mortality, orphaned calves, and illegal captivity</strong></p>  <p>In addition to specific gillnets to hunt Manatees, the high use of fishing nets in the Amazon has increased incidental calf mortality in the past few years. These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs). In the past 10 years CPPMA received 39 calves for rehabilitation (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016).</p>  <p>From 2010-2015, 3 calves died in nets or captivity in Peru (S. Kendall pers obs). It is estimated that two Amazonian Manatees are presently in captivity in Colombia (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>Between 2007 and 2010, Centro de Rescate Amazónico (Iquitos, Peru) rescued 28 Manatees (Perea <em>et al. </em>2011), and until 2013 successfully rehabilitated 25 individuals (Landeo-Yauri <em>et al. </em>2013). Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto Nariño (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of Belém and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda Leão <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Most of the waters inhabited by Amazonian Manatees are very murky and, probably as an adaptation to the past and ongoing hunting pressure, Amazonian Manatees are extremely secretive.&#160;T<span class=""alt-edited"">remendous<span class=""shorttext""> research efforts have been made,<span lang=""EN""> but&#160;there are no reliable population estimates available, although numbers are almost certainly lower than historical figures due to centuries of hunting. Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014). A Manatee is held for show to tourists in Puerto Alegria, Peru, upstream from Leticia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Manatees are protected by national laws in all countries of confirmed distribution (Brazil since 1967, Colombia since 1969, Peru since 1973 (Silva 2009) and Ecuador since 2002 (Tirira 2011)). Listed under Appendix I of CITES, signed by the four countries, also signatories of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All but Colombia are parties to the Convention on Migratory Species.</p><p>Presently there are national management plans specific for the species in Colombia (Dirección de Ecosistemas 2005) and Brazil (Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2011) and for aquatic mammals (including Manatees) in Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Management plans exist for two protected areas (Pacaya Samiria in Peru and Mamiraua Reserve in Brazil), and Puerto Nariño (Colombia) has informal local management agreement (S. Kendall pers. obs).</p><p>In 2014 the Biodiversity department of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador included Manatee as a focal species for conservation, and relative abundance studies are planned for the Cuyabeno-Yasuni corridor in the Napo river basin between 2016 and 2018. The same department is attempting to have the corridor between the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and the Yasuní National Park recognized as a RAMSAR site (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2016)</p><p>Amazonian Manatees have been recorded from two protected areas in Ecuador, three in Colombia, four in Peru and at least 53 in Brazil (D. Souza pers. obs). Unfortunately, hunting continues even within protected areas.</p><p>Some 90% of the possible area of distribution of Manatees in Colombia is outside of protected areas. In Colombia the conservation work has been greatly based on participation of local communities (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Efforts include year-round conservation and monitoring by the Natütama Foundation in the key areas of the Colombian Amazon, with information network for nearby areas; intensive education program<a name=""_GoBack""></a> in the Colombian Amazon, with occasional visits to Tarapaca on the Putumayo river; release of calves by fishermen in the Colombian Amazon (Kendall 2013): 4 releases from nets from 2010-2015 by Natutama and associated fishermen (S. Kendall pers obs).</p><p>Ex-situ research at INPA captive setting (Brazil) and in Amazon Rescue Center (Peru)&#160;is providing the most information about the ecology and biology of the Amazonian Manatee, as reproductive hormone dosages, morphometric, allometric and growth studies of individuals, determination of nutritional parameters of milk in different states of lactation, evaluation of the animal health status, vocalization and acoustic ontogeny, among others.</p><p>Efforts of releasing rehabilitated Manatees back to the wild have been conducted by Mamirauá Institute (Marmontel 2012, 2015), INPA (Rosas and da Silva 2008, Souza <em>et al. </em>2012), ICMBio (Luna <em>et al. </em>2012) in Brazil, Amazon Rescue Center (Landeo-Yauri and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Sánchez-Babilonia 2015) in Peru, and Omacha Foundation in Colombia (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014).

44051115,41778,Tayassu pecari,Vulnerable,A2bcde+3bcde,2013,2012-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered Vulnerable under criteria A2bcde+3bcde due to an ongoing population reduction estimated to be close to 30% in the past three generations (18 years) due to habitat loss, illegal hunting, competition with livestock, and epidemics. Based on current rates of decline it is suspected that this rate of reduction will continue for the next three generations (18 years). This species occurs in the Amazon, where such a high rate of decline may seem improbable, but new evidence gathered by the Peccary Specialist Group has been documenting several cases of mysterious disappearance of the species in what appears to be pristine habitat (Keuroghlian <em>et al </em>2012, Richard-Hansen <em>et al.</em>&#160;in prep.), which are similar to the well documented recent disappearance of White-lipped Peccary in large continuous protected areas such as Iguaçu National Park (Azevedo and Conforti 2008). In addition, the local extinctions of populations in Ecuador and Bolivia (Roldan Simonetti 2001, Tirira 2011) and throughout their geographical range is an ongoing process (Althrichter <em>et al. </em>2012, Keuroghlian <em>et al.</em> 2012). Due to the alarming increase of local extinctions, numerous countries have been updating their Red List Category for the species to Endangered or Vulnerable, e.g., most recently: Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador. <br/><br/>This species has a wide distributional range and occurs in many protected areas; however, it is rapidly disappearing from fragmented areas and overall it has suffered a major range reduction in its historical distribution. The relative vulnerability of White-lipped Peccaries to local extinction in established conservation units needs to be considered. Extant conservation units in the different ecosystems are not necessarily adequate to ensure the survival of White-lipped Peccaries, and even large protected areas are not enough to guarantee the protection of viable populations. Unfortunately, the future for many of the currently continuous tracts of tropical forest will be similar to what has happened in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. This reduction has been more dramatic for Mesoamerican countries, where it has been extirpated from El Salvador and has been greatly reduced in Costa Rica (89%). Mexico and Guatemala (84%) (Altrichter <em>et al. </em>2012). In other areas within its range, it is undergoing localized declines due to widespread and increasing deforestation, and intense hunting pressure. According to Altrichter <em>et al.</em> (2012), within 48% of its current range, White-lipped Peccaries have a reduced abundance and a low probability of long-term survival.","Some 60% of this species' distribution is in humid tropical forests. However, they are found in a wide diversity of habitats including wet and dry grasslands and woodlands, xerophitic areas like the Gran Chaco, tropical dry forests, and coastal mangroves (Wetzel and Lovett 1974, Mayer and Brandt 1982, Vaughan 1983, Sowls 1984, Altrichter and Boaglio 2004, Taber <em>et al.</em> 2008, Desbiez <em>et al.</em> 2009b). They range altitudinally from sea level to over 1,900 m on the eastern slopes of the Andes. White-lipped Peccaries tend to frequent areas close to water and may even visit coastal beaches to forage. Peccaries are primarily frugivorous (Husson 1978, Kiltie 1981, Beck 2005, Desbiez <em>et al.</em> 2009a, Keuroghlian and Eaton 2008a), but will eat other plant resources, invertebrates, fungi and even occasional fish (Fragoso &#160;1994, D. Fernandes pers. comm.). Beck (2006) determined that White-lipped Peccaries fed on 144 plant species belonging to 36 families across their range. The species plays an important role as prey for large felines, ecosystem engineers, and in the function and structure of Neotropical forests as a major predator and disperser of seeds (Altrichter <em>et al. </em>1999, Beck 2005, Keuroghlian and Eaton 2008a, Desbiez 2009a, Desbiez and Keuroghlian 2009, Keuroghlian <em>et al. </em>2009a, Cavalcanti and Geese 2010, Beck <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>A number of radio-telemetry based range size estimates are now available from a diversity of habitats across this species' distribution. In Costa Rica, herds in tropical moist forest were found to have a mean annual home range size of 32.00-37.80 km² (100% MCP) (Carrillo <em>et al.</em> 2002). Fragoso (2004) estimated home ranges from 21.80 km²<sup></sup>&#160; to 200.00 km²<sup></sup> (100% MCP) for groups monitored over three years in moist forest in Maraca Island in Roraima state Brazil. Keuroghlian <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated an annual herd home range of 29.51 km² (100% MCP) in a fragmented semideciduous Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Reyna-Hurtado and Tanner (2009b) found annual herd home ranges from 43.60 km² to 121.00 km²<sup></sup> (100%) in tropical semi-dry forest in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Southern Mexico. All home range estimates presented are based on 100% or 95% minimum convex polygons for comparative purposes. Reyna-Hurtado (2007), Carrillo <em>et al.</em> (2002) and Keuroghlian <em>et al. </em>(2004) observed a high level of spatial overlap between subherds and the amount of overlap could vary depending on the season and resources available. &#160;The consensus is that white-lipped peccaries are clearly wide-ranging and require large areas for survival (Altrichter and Almeida 2002, Keuroghlian <em>et al.</em> 2004, Reyna-Hurtado 2007). Their movements respond in part to changes in the availability of fruit patches and water sources (Kiltie and Terborgh 1983; Mendez 1970; Sowls 1984; Bodmer 1990; Altrichter <em>et al. </em>2001; Keuroghlian <em>et al. </em>2004; Beck 2005; Reyna-Hurtado and Tanner 2009b; Keuroghlian and Eaton 2008a, 2008b, 2009b). <br/><br/>White-lipped Peccary herds often exceed 100 individuals, though groups of as few as five to more than 200 individuals have also been observed (Kiltie and Terborgh 1983, Desbiez &#160;2007, Donkin 1985, Mayer and Brandt 1987, Fragoso 2004, Reyna-Hurtado 2007). In certain seasons in some areas, large herds divide into smaller groups according to the distribution and abundance of food, although the more frequent reporting of smaller groups in some areas is probably correlated with increased hunting pressure (Ditt 2002). Group sizes in hunted areas adjacent to the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico were smaller (Median=16, SE=1.84, n=15) than these living inside the reserve where no hunting is allowed (Median=25, SE=1.84 n=9, Reyna-Hurtado 2009a). Keuroghlian <em>et al. </em>2004 observed that a population of 150 White-lipped Peccaries in a fragmented area of Atlantic Forest periodically divided into 3-4 sub-herds with an average of 42 individuals each. They also observed a high frequency of switching of individuals among sub-herds and documented periodic sub-herd fusion and fission. Switching of individuals has also been observed in a current long term (10 years) radio telemetry study in the Pantanal of Brazil &#160; Keuroghlian <em>et al.</em> in prep.) and in Costa Rica (Sáenz and Carrillo 1999). Biondo <em>et al.</em> 2011 analyzed two different populations 80 km apart in the Pantanal. They found a low degree of genetic differentiation between the locations analyzed, and dispersal by both sexes (contrary to the predicted male-biased dispersal of most mammalian species). In addition, 30% of males and females were predicted to be dispersers, which can indicate high levels of gene flow between the two different herds (Biondo<em> et al.</em> 2011). For this reason, Biondo <em>et al.</em> (2011) stress the need of very large areas to maintain gene flow and genetic diversity between these distant but connected populations, and suggest &#160;managing them as a unique population; this requires &#160;maintaining ecological corridors, and natural links between herd populations (Biondo <em>et al. </em>2011).","Widespread and continued deforestation and intense hunting pressure are the main causes for the decline and extinction of many White-lipped Peccary populations throughout its vast biogeographical range. White-lipped Peccaries form large herds and consequently require extensive and contiguous areas of habitat to obtain sufficient resources throughout the year. Hunting pressure by landless squatters and poachers has also contributed to local extinctions of the conspicuous White-lipped Peccary herds in many Neotropical forest fragments (Cullen, Bodmer and Valladares-Padua 2001). The loss and fragmentation of their habitat also exposes them to increased hunting pressure by providing more access to human hunters. Hunting may have a devastating impact on a herd of white-lipped peccaries, because large numbers are killed at one time. Peres (1996) documented local extinctions at all of his Amazonian sites which had heavy to moderate hunting pressure. Even light hunting may be a problem in certain regions of terra-firme forest, where resources are limited and peccary population densities are naturally low (Peres 1996). In most of its biogeograhical range, the progressive destruction of habitat for agriculture and cattle ranching, as well as timber extraction, has already accounted for much of the species' habitat loss (Altrichter and Boaglio 2004, Altrichter <em>et al.</em> 2012). As of 2005, large populations of White-lipped Peccaries persisted only in 21% of its historic range (Altrichter <em>et al. </em>2012). The species exposure to over hunting and local extinctions of apparently healthy populations in large conservation units is now well documented in several areas of Brazil (e.g. Roraima, Fragoso 2004; Iguaçu National Park, Azevedo and Conforti, 2008; Plateau region of the Mata Atlantica, Morro do Diabo, Mangini pers. comm.; and the Mata Atlantica of Bahia, Flesher, pers. comm. Whether this is due to epidemics, over hunting or other factors is still unclear (Keuroghlian <em>et al. </em>2012). In the Atlantic forest there are very few populations within suitable habitat large enough to be exempt from extinction in the region (Jorge <em>et al.</em> in prep.). Researchers working in the fragmented Atlantic forest biome had evidence of sharp, sometimes unexplained, population declines (Keuroghlian <em>et al.</em> 2012). Southeastern Brazil is densely populated, and native habitats have been extensively fragmented. In most cases with a similar scenario, recolonization of small, isolated fragments would be impossible without human intervention, because source populations are not available in the vicinity to replace populations that become locally extinct (Keuroghlian 2003).<br/><br/>Similarly, Fragoso's (2004) documented a concern for the species in Roraima due to strong evidence of periodic and sometimes permanent White-lipped Peccary population crashes which seem density-dependent and are most likely due to epizootic events. Reported diseases has been documented in free ranging White-lipped Peccary populations (Karesh <em>et al</em>. 1998, Herrera <em>et al</em>. 2008, Freitas <em>et al</em> . 2010). This is a particular cause of concern due to the increasingly fragmented distribution of White-lipped Peccary populations. One risk is that isolated populations that crash may have difficulties recovering since they are cut off from dispersal of potential source population areas.<br/><br/>In November 2010, the IUCN and the Instituto Chico Mendes (ICMBio), the Federal Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, and official assessor of species red listing for the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, signed an agreement to build the Brazilian Red List of Threatened Species. The White-lipped Peccary (which was not included in the previous official Brazilian list of threatened fauna - MMA, 2003), was then classified as Vulnerable in Brazil (A2abcde+A3abcde). In the endangered Cerrado biome, it was classified as Endangered, and the only ungulate that received a Critically Endangered classification for the Atlantic forest Biome (Keuroghlian <em>et al. </em>2012). This change of status is due to the intensification of threats and most importantly, to the increase of knowledge about the species. According to the workshop participants in Brazil, a population decline of at least 30% in the last 18 years (three generations) is suspected, and an equal population decline is projected for the next 18 years.<br/><br/>Another important result from this regional assessment in Brazil was learning that local extinctions of White-lipped Peccary in pristine areas not only occurred in Brazil, but also in other areas. For example, in French Guiana, Richard-Hansen, Khazraie, Surugue, and Grenand (in prep.) show data that clearly supports the evidence of a population crash during the last 4 years. In Bolivia, White-lipped Peccaries have become locally extinct in areas surrounding a Tsimane village in the Estación Biológica&#160;Beni (Roldan and Simonetti 2001). In Ecuador, according to the published Red List (Tirira 2011), White-lipped Peccaries are considered Endangered in the Amazon, and Critically Endangered in the Pacific Coast. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, White-lipped Peccaries have been already extirpated from large areas along the lower slopes of the Andes, and are rapidly disappearing from all parts of their geographic range due to overhunting (and perhaps disease). In the Coast, where large-scale deforestation occurred during the past century, G. Zapata-Ríos (pers.comm.) documented only a few small populations remaining in Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and its buffer zone area. Recently, in December 2010, Mexico's National Secretary of Environment also classified the species as endangered (R. Reyna-Hurtado pers. comm.). In the Chaco of Paraguay, the alarming rates of deforestation and continued hunting are a cause for alarm, and although no formal survey has taken place recently, the number of herds as well as the number of individuals in a herd is notably declining (J. Campos pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Both the Collared Peccary (<em>Pecari tajacu</em>) and White-lipped Peccary are important resources for subsistence hunters in the Peruvian Amazon, as elsewhere in the Amazon basin (Bodmer <em>et al.</em> 2004a). Bodmer (1995), Peres (1996), and Redford and Robinson (1987) showed that peccaries were a preferred game of native and non-native people in the Amazonian region. In Peru, subsistence hunting of peccaries is permitted and is legally defined as the use of peccary meat for household consumption or the sale of peccary meat in settlements of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. Rural inhabitants hunt peccaries mainly for their meat, which has an economic value of approximately $23 for a Collared Peccary and $30 for a White-lipped Peccary either for subsistence food or sale (Bodmer <em>et al. </em>2004b). Peccary pelts are sold as a by-product and have an economic value to hunters of approximately $5 for a Collared Peccary pelt and $3 for a White-lipped Peccary pelt (Bodmer and Pezo 2001, Fang 2003). The only country with CITES permit to export white-lipped peccary pelts for the hide trade is Peru where from 1997 to 2008 a quota of between 35,500 and 44,300 skins and leather products has been granted annually (CITES Database 2008, <a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>). The pelts are tanned in Peru and sold to the European leather industry for the manufacture of high quality shoes and gloves, with the latter retailing for as much as $200 a pair. However, this activity should be careful controlled because of potential risks to White-lipped Peccary given that population monitoring methods are problematic. Also, since some pelts are rejected because of scars, parasite marks (e.g., bot flies), or bullet holes, this raises the question as to how many individuals are killed in total to obtain pelts that meet the required quality standards for international trading? Other South American countries such as Argentina and Bolivia, are exploring plans for the international commercialization of peccary pelts under CITES. Detailed surveys of the subsistence and commercial use of this species on national scales have not been undertaken in other South American range countries except Argentina (Altrichter 2005).<br/><br/>At the southern and northern extremes of this species' distribution its status is of particular concern. In the Argentine Chaco, Altrichter (2005) found that hunting of White-lipped Peccary was not sustainable because density of this species was three times lower in areas closer to villages than in protected areas, hunters did not discriminate between age and sex, and more than 40% of the population's production was being harvested. Population size was estimated to be at 60% of the carrying capacity (Altrichter 2005). Threats to the species in Mesoamerica (Tropical Mexico and Central America) include hunting and habitat reduction as well as un-managed legal sport hunting in a couple of Mexican States (Campeche and Quintana Roo, Reyna-Hurtado 2009a). Overall in Mesoamerica this species' situation is alarming due to rapid population decline over the last 20 years. In Mexico this species has been extirpated from Veracruz, Tabasco, Yucatan and survive only in a few populations on the largest reserves and a few large communal forests where the species is under strong hunting pressure (Reyna-Hurtado and Tanner 2007). A similar pattern has occurred for almost all the Central America countries where the species is now confined to the few large tropical forest reserves (Altrichter <em>et al.</em> 2012).","White-lipped Peccary densities vary across their distribution in different habitats. Keuroghlian <em>et al.</em> (2004) and Cullen (1997), both working in southern Brazil, found density estimates between 3.9 and 10.2 individuals/km²<sup></sup> in tropical forest fragments. Fragoso (1998a, 1998b, 1999), studying a White-lipped Peccary population in the northern Brazilian Amazon, in Roraima State, reported densities declining within five years, and attributed the population crash to a potential &#160;epizootic disease (Fragoso 2004). In the Brazilian Pantanal, Desbiez <em>et al.</em> (2004) found 7.5 ind./km²<sup></sup>&#160; and &#160;9.6 ind./km² in two different locations in southern the southern Pantanal. Desbiez <em>et al.</em> (2010) documented the importance of habitat in peccary density estimates: peccary density estimates in forested areas was 13.7 ind/km²<sup></sup>, and in the open Cerrado &#160;habitat it was 3.0 ind/km²<sup></sup>. Lower densities have been found in dry forests. Altrichter (2005) found White-lipped Peccary densities in the Argentine Gran Chaco dry forest to be 0.33 ind/km² in hunted sites and 1.04 ind/km²<sup></sup> in non-hunted sites; while Reyna-Hurtado and Tanner (2007) found similar densities of 0.43 ind/km² in the semi-dry forest of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico.",Decreasing,"White-lipped Peccaries are confined to the Neotropical Region, from southeastern Mexico in the north, through Central America and northern and central South America, as far south as Entre Rios in northern Argentina and Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil (Sowls 1997). To date, it has been proposed that there are five subspecies of White-lipped Peccary, but this has not been validated through genetic and/or morphological research (Groves and Grubb 1993, Taber <em>et al. </em>2011). Limited chromosome (Giannonil <em>et al.</em> 1981, Benirschke and Kumamoto 1984) and DNA (Gongora and Moran 2005) studies have revealed polymorphisms and some variation in sequence divergence among a few individuals from different geographical regions. <br/><br/><em>Tayassu pecari</em> was introduced to Cuba in 1930 (Mayer and Wetzel 1987), but is no longer found in the wild there. It is presumed to be extirpated from El Salvador, and its range has been significantly reduced in Mexico, Central America, and South America in the last 20 years (Leopold 1959; Reyna-Hurtado <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Altrichter <em>et al</em>. 2012).","This species is hunted both for food and hides, which are traded internationally. White-lipped Peccary is an important resource for subsistence hunters in the Peruvian Amazon, as elsewhere in the Amazon basin (Bodmer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004a). In Peru, subsistence hunting of peccaries is permitted and is legally defined as the use of peccary meat for household consumption or the sale of peccary meat in settlements of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. Rural inhabitants hunt peccaries mainly for their meat, which has an economic value of approximately $23 for a Collared Peccary and $30 for a White-lipped Peccary either for subsistence food or sale (Bodmer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004b). Peccary pelts are sold as a by-product and have an economic value to hunters of approximately $5 for a Collared Peccary pelt and $3 for a White-lipped Peccary pelt (Bodmer and Pezo 2001, Fang 2003). The only country with CITES permit to export white-lipped peccary pelts for the hide trade is Peru where from 1997 to 2008 a quota of between 35,500 and 44,300 skins and leather products has been granted annually (CITES Database 2008,&#160;<a href=""http://www.cites.org/"">www.cites.org</a>). The pelts are tanned in Peru and sold to the European leather industry for the manufacture of high quality shoes and gloves, with the latter retailing for as much as $200 a pair.",Terrestrial,"This species occurs in numerous protected areas throughout its extensive range; however it is uncertain whether the existing network of reserves is adequate to ensure the survival of representative populations sufficient in size to maintain viable populations in all major habitat types within its distribution (Altrichter <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also doubtful if most reserves are large enough to allow the formation of large herds of this species, or that there is sufficient connectivity between reserves to permit recovery when epizootic events or population crashes occur for other reasons. This is of particular concern in Central America (March 1993).<br/><br/>Peccary pelts were exported from many central and South American countries during the first half of the 20th century prior to the implementation of CITES in 1973. During the 1960s and 70s many countries began to prohibit the export of peccary pelts and in 1986 Collared and White-lipped Peccaries were placed on Appendix II of CITES. Peru is currently the only range state that permits legal export of peccary pelts, and hides can only be exported if they originate from subsistence hunters living in the Amazonian region. Other countries, including Bolivia and Argentina, are exploring prospects for developing a managed commercial harvest of peccary hides for export. In the case of Bolivia, peccary pelts would come out of subsistence hunting. Harvesting peccaries just for hides is not in the plans of the region (Pacheco pers. comm.). Such an expanded ""legal"" harvest will need to be carefully monitored since it risks inadvertently promoting illegal commercial use of the species through expanding the market, and hence demands for skins and other peccary products. A revision of the CITES permit on trade might be necessary with the growing interest of peccary hide trade in other countries.<br/><br/>White-lipped Peccaries are widely maintained in captivity in their countries of origin, but very rarely elsewhere, mainly because of the stringent veterinary restrictions placed on the movement of live animals into countries with significant domestic pork industry. <br/><br/>Research on the management, conservation, ecology, and biology has expanded in recent years. A range wide status assessment on this species has been completed, based on a workshop held in 2005, where historical and current status and distribution data were compared and main threats and population status was determined (Altrichter <em>et al.</em> 2012.).&#160;However, research, management and monitoring capacity is lacking in many of the range countries. Capacity building of conservation biologists, local and national government technicians, and community para-technicians is a high priority for the species.

45174127,21474,Tapirus terrestris,Vulnerable,A2cde+3cde,2019,2018-07-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Vulnerable due to ongoing population reduction estimated to be slightly greater than 30% in the past three generations (33 years) due to habitat loss, illegal hunting, road-kill and competition with livestock, and the current rate of decline is projected to continue for the next three generations (33 years). Although this rate of decline seems improbable considering the species’ occurrence in the vast Amazon, the fact is that the species has been extirpated over large portions of its range and severely reduced in other large portions. Lowland tapir populations seem unlikely to persist anywhere humans occur at densities any greater than 1/km².<br/><br/>The estimated 30% decline over three generations takes into consideration the entire global range and was calculated using an average of reduction between a variety of biomes. Although only about 15-20% of the Amazon has been deforested in the past 30 years, 90% of the Atlantic forests have disappeared and 40% of the Pantanal has been converted to human use. Most of the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes have been converted to agriculture and cattle ranching, however this has happened over a period greater than three generations. Even where habitat remains, populations are reduced and dispersed due to the effects of hunting,&#160; which is greatly amplified around increasing human populations and settlement of the Amazon basin, especially along rivers and in the Andean foothills.<br/><br/>The effects of deforestation, hunting, and competition from domestic livestock have all contributed to population declines and fragmentation in the past and are inferred to continue at the present rate (if not more) into the future. An increase in road-kill is leading to tapir population declines in the Cerrado, the Pantanal, and the Atlantic Forest. Deforestation is increasing in certain parts of the species' range (e.g. Chaco Forest), while subsistence hunting and a developing wild-meat industry may cause further declines in the future. The Lowland Tapir&#160;is now either completely absent or severely fragmented across much of its historic range, with the Northern Amazon and the remaining Pantanal (Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay) becoming important strongholds as southern, eastern and northwestern populations are declining rapidly.","<em>Tapirus terrestris </em>inhabits lowland South American moist swamp forests, dry and moist shrublands and grasslands and a wide variety of wetlands. Habitat association varies extensively, although the most important habitats tend to be moist, wet or seasonally inundated areas (Bodmer and Brooks 1997, Ayala and Wallace 2009). This species has been observed to be associated with both water and salt-licks. The degree to which tapir are tolerant to habitat degradation varies regionally, but generally tapir are a forest dependent species. To date, no conclusion has been drawn as to why tapirs may thrive in one partially logged or disturbed area and be absent from others, however, it can be inferred based on other tapir species that Lowland Tapir&#160;cannot tolerate large scale habitat change in combination with hunting pressure. There is some evidence from the Atlantic Forest that suggests tapirs can tolerate radical large scale changes in habitat, as they have been found to persist in landscapes of commercially produced grains with only small degraded forest fragments (Rossi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Additional evidence from the interior of Sao Paulo and Parana confirms this research. Habitat condition appears to be less important in limiting population persistence than hunting and deaths caused by vehicle collisions.<br/>Harald Beck (pers. comm.) reports that tapirs have higher densities in Amazonian forests that contain two crucial features: Aguajales and salt licks.  Aguajales are palm swamps that typically range between 0.1 ha to over 100 ha and are dominated by the Mauritia flexuosa palm. The fruits of this palm are a crucial food resource for tapirs especially during the dry season.  In fact, tapirs are the prime seed dispersers for this palm, indicating the close evolutionary relationship between both species. Furthermore, Aguajales have incoming streams or small rivers which may also be crucial for other ecological requirements of tapir's including thermoregulation thus they sustain higher tapir densities.  Salt licks are smaller aquatic systems and may occur in clumped spatial distribution. Tapirs, among other mammals, frequently visit salt licks to obtain essential minerals.  Hunters, knowing the tapir’s fondness for salt, wait at those locations because their success is dramatically increased.<br/><br/>Tapir are ecologically more prone to be impacted by hunting due to long gestation and generational time. Reproduction is slow enough to make recovery difficult for the species in areas where there is any prolonged hunting activity. Hunting is a serious threat along the numerous new road systems, settlement and along the agricultural frontier in the Amazon basin. Hunting also occurs around logging camps and can completely eliminate the species from seemingly viable habitat.","<p>The main threats to the species include loss of habitat through deforestation, hunting for meat, road-kill, and competition with domestic livestock. The impacts of hunting on populations are amplified by the very low ability of tapir to quickly re-populate impacted areas. Though several strongholds occur - populations have been severely reduced and fragmented across the entire Cerrado (Brazil), Chaco (Argentina/ Paraguay), Atlantic forest (Brazil/ Argentina/ Paraguay) and llanos (Venezuela/Colombia) biomes. In Argentina and southern Brazil the species has been extirpated from the tropical and temperate grassland and shrubland - and are rapidly declining in the dry Chaco. Additionally the species has been extirpated from the entire Caatinga biome of north-eastern Brazil. <br/> <br/> In the northeast, tapirs are present only inside protected areas where illegal hunting is minimal. Outside protected areas, they are still hunted, chased by dogs, and negatively impacted by competition with cattle and illegal timber activities. The species is in rapid decline along the eastern Amazon and its Southern Tributaries where extensive hunting and deforestation have reduced almost all large mammal populations. In addition, populations are declining rapidly along the agricultural front spreading into western Brazil and along the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Colombia.<br/> <br/> In Argentina, <em>T. terrestris</em> has disappeared from around 50% of its original distribution, as a consequence of deforestation, hunting and livestock activity. The species is absent in many areas of transition between the montane forests, in important sectors of the Chaco and the Atlantic forest and completely in the Espinal. However, there are still populations in good condition in some forested areas, mainly those with limited accessibility and human activities, such as mountain forests or protected areas with strict controls. There is currently an important effort to reintroduce the species in the province of Corrientes (Esteros del Iberá).<br/> <br/> Roadkill is becoming a major threat to Tapir in the Cerrado (Brazil), the Pantanal (Brazil), and the Atlantic Forest (Argentina/Brazil) (P. Medici pers.comm, D. Varela in litt.).</p>  <p>In Bolivia, tapirs are susceptible to hunting, and habitat degradation. While they may well be more common than expected in protected areas, as was found out in Costa Rica and elsewhere for <em>T. bairdii</em>, they do not fare well in the presence of hunting. In French Guiana, tapirs are regularly hunted and sold commercially for meat in markets and restaurants. Little information is available for the population in Guyana, however, tapirs are not protected there at present and are hunted by subsistence hunters as well as by a developing bush-meat industry as roads are cut into the forest for logging.</p>  <p>In Paraguay a recent threatened species workshop assessed the Lowland Tapir as ""Vulnerable A2ac"" mainly due to habitat loss in the last 40 years, and the resulting decline in the distribution and population of the species.&#160; More than 90% of the Atlantic Forest has been lost, and the Chaco could experience the same declines over the next 30 years. Hunting and habitat loss were identified as main threats to the species.<br/> <br/> In conclusion it is difficult to calculate the overall impact of hunting on populations, but we can infer from previous studies that in the past 30 years extensive and ongoing habitat loss combined with hunting and accumulated indirect threats have been much greater than previously estimated, and much greater than would be suspected by looking at maps of remaining forest in the Amazon.</p>","Very little is known of Lowland Tapir populations. Populations are decreasing across its range, though numerous strongholds exist. However, there is insufficient information available to extrapolate population sizes across these regions. In recent years camera-traps have been effective for estimating probability of occupancy, relative abundance, and even density estimates for many species within the tapir's range (Trolle <em>et al.</em> 2008, Cruz 2012, Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tobler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Ferregueti <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;A variety of density estimates have been proposed ranging from 0.20 to 3.7 individuals/km² (P. Medici pers. comm). The most likely reason for this variation is both sampling and study design bias as well as the fact that Lowland Tapir, although generally rare and elusive, can be locally common (i.e. around salt lick and permanent and seasonal water sources). In fact great variation in density likely also reflects the results of both direct and indirect threats in the form of hunting pressure, protection and seasonal variation.  Additionally, it can also reflect the tapir’s ability to adapt to different habitat types and availability of resources (food and water).",Decreasing,"<em>Tapirus terrestris</em> is found in lowland regions of northern and central South America, from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Historically this species was found east of the Andes and north of the Espinal grasslands and shrublands of Argentina throughout the chaco, pantanal, cerrado, llanos, caatinga and Amazonian/Orinoco forests, however, populations have been severely reduced and often limited to forest biomes and wetlands. The species has been extirpated from the caatinga. In the northern Andes Lowland Tapir has been extirpated from the dry inter-Andean valleys and is becoming increasingly rare along the agriculture frontiers than are sweeping through parts of the western and southern Amazon basin. The distribution in the cerrado has been diminished to a few small populations in protected areas and those in the pantanal are rapidly declining.","This species is hunted for food. Also, the skin is used internationally, with leather goods products having been seen for sale in Italy (A.

The species is officially and legally protected in many range countries, however, hunting laws are seldom enforced and therefore these have proven ineffective. It is listed on CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/>In Argentina, one of the main tapir populations in the Chaco forest was protected by the recently created Impenetrable National Park. In the Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Argentina, wildlife underpasses and overpasses were built for mitigating roadkill. Camera trap monitoring confirmed tapir use of these mitigation structures (D. Varela, in litt.). Currently, there are some experiences of tapir re-introduction in areas where the species was extinct many decades ago (e.g. the Iberá wetland in Argentina and the Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest in Brazil).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Population status  across its entire distribution is not currently known, but non-trivial  declines have been observed over the past 150 years across much of its  range (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). This cold-tolerant jackrabbit is now  rare or extinct in portions of its former range in British Columbia,  Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Missouri, and Washington (Applegate 1997, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). It  is a species of concern in California (Williams 1986), and was reported  to be absent from former habitats in the Yellowstone ecosystem (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, Berger 2008) - a status shown to be overly pessimistic by Gunther <em>et al.</em>  (2009). The cause of this reduction is generally thought to center on  the conversion of native prairie to shrub-steppe or agriculture and/or  the arrival of expanding Black-tailed Jackrabbit populations better  suited to human disturbance (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is unknown  whether these declines and replacement by Black-tailed Jackrabbits have  been the result of habitat changes or reflect a continuation of climatic  shifts that have occurred throughout Holocene times (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). Therefore this species is declining and is clearly a species that should be carefully watched.","The primary habitat of the White-tailed Jackrabbit is open prairie and  plains grassland, but this varies with locality (Flux and Angermann  1990, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018). They are also found on montane and  subalpine pastures among scattered evergreens to 3,100 m altitude in  Colorado (Flux and Angermann 1990). Diet of this species is  predominantly grasses and forbs, with shrubs during the winter (Lim  1987). The breeding season was recorded to extend from late February  through mid-July in North Dakota (Flux and Angermann 1990). A similar  breeding season was recorded in Wyoming (Rogowitz 1992). The season is  shortened in the northern extent of its range to May through early July  (Lim 1987). The gestation period is variable, one account sets it as low  as one month and another as high as 43 days (Lim 1987). It is thought  that elevation and latitude may influence total gestation time (Lim  1987). Breeding conditions and environmental factors influence the total  number of litters produced each year (Lim 1987). Common litter size is  recorded as four to five young. Longevity is unknown but speculated to  be up to five years (Forsyth 1999).","There are numerous hypothesized factors contributing to the decline of  the White-tailed Jackrabbit, but the most prevalent appears to be the  conversion of native prairie to shrub-steppe or non-grass agriculture.  This habitat alteration has led to the exclusion of White-tailed  Jackrabbits where the distribution expansion of Black-tailed Jackrabbits  has occurred (Lim 1987, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The population density of White-tailed Jackrabbits varies greatly  temporally and across the range of the species.

This  distribution represented an expansion from its original distribution,  which resulted from the creation of suitable habitat (Lim 1987). There  is some debate to whether this species was introduced to Wisconsin (Lim  1987). Now, however, the range of the species is definitely contracting.  Some treatments indicate that this species has been possibly extirpated  from British Columbia, southern Nebraska, Kansas and Illinois, and some  recent distribution maps exclude Missouri (Flinders and Chapman 2003).

They are always associated with  water and will swim to escape predators and hunters (Whitaker and  Hamilton 1998).

Use of early successional bottomland habitats suggests that  restoration efforts could help maintain populations (Crawford <em>et al.</em>  2018). Because of their habitat preferences, Swamp Rabbits have been  suggested as an indicator of quality bottomland forest habitat (Hillard <em>et al.</em>  2017). Despite their preference for lowlands, adjacent upland areas may  provide important habitat during seasonal flooding (Vale and Kissell  2010).

Swamp Rabbit occupancy and detectability increase in larger tracts of habitat (Fantz <em>et al.</em> 2017). In timber habitat Swamp Rabbit density is around 2 rabbits/ha (Nielsen and Berkman 2018).<br/><br/>Swamp Rabbits prefer a diet of sedges and also feed on grasses and forbs (Chapman and Ceballos 1990).<br/><br/>Females  have litter sizes from one to six, and produce two to five litters per  year (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). Gestation is 35-40 days (Whitaker and  Hamilton 1998) and females reach sexual maturity at 152 days of age.","Swamp Rabbits are a favorite game species, though their speed, ability  to swim, and habitat preferences offers some protection from hunters and  predators (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Hunting is regulated by  individual state wildlife agencies (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). While  hunting is not a major threat to stable populations (Nielsen and Berkman  2018), Swamp Rabbits appear to have a sensitivity to harvest in the  late season (winter) (Bond <em>et al.</em> 2004). Population viability  modeling suggests that changes in fecundity and catastrophic flooding  may pose the greatest risk to the species (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Habitat  loss has been the greatest cause of decline of Swamp Rabbits. In  Missouri in 1973, a decline of suitable habitat from 850,000 ha to  40,000 ha was recorded over the previous 103 years (Korte and  Fredrickson 1977). The habitat was converted from forest to cropland.  Changes to waterways and resulting flooding also negatively impact the  availability of habitat for Swamp Rabbits (Nielsen and Berkman 2018).<br/><br/>Habitat  fragmentation is an issue associated with human encroachment upon Swamp  Rabbit habitat. Many Swamp Rabbit populations exist on small tracts of  private property, impeding dispersal and creating difficulties for  management (Scheibe and Henson 2003).<br/><br/>Flooding of wet forested  areas has a negative impact on Swamp Rabbit populations, but floods in  some areas induce dispersal (Scheibe and Henson 2003).","Swamp Rabbits are an important game species in much of their range and  are hunted for meat, fur, and sport. They are known to be locally  abundant in some areas but appear to be declining in others (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990, Barbour <em>et al.</em> 2001, Scheibe and Henson 2003). Few studies have been conducted to determine the abundance or decline of Swamp Rabbits.<br/><br/>In  Missouri, the overall area of suitable habitat is decreasing, but there  are still several viable populations within the known range, and there  is some indication that new populations have recently been naturally  established, possibly due to dispersal facilitated by flooding (Scheibe  and Henson 2003). In Louisiana, there are large tracts of suitable  habitat and it is an important game species (Chapman and Ceballos 1990).<br/><br/>In  South Carolina, the Rabbit Hunter Survey data from 2016-2017 show that  there is an increase in rabbits jumped/hour, 1.35 (2007-2008) to 1.58  (2016-2017), but of the rabbits harvested only 1.72% were Swamp Rabbits  (South Carolina Rabbit Hunter Survey, 2016-2017).<br/><br/>Three  population viability analyses (PVA) have provided insight into local  population trends of Swamp Rabbits at the northern fringe of their  range. In southern Illinois, the PVA suggested a 0% chance of  quasi-extinction (90% metapopulation decline) of Swamp Rabbits within 25  (or even 50) years. Changes in fecundity values and the effects of  catastrophic flooding had the greatest effect on extinction risk, and  changes in no other parameter yielded any appreciable impact. Removing  the largest patches from the population increased the 25-year risk of  extinction to 4%, whereas any other modifications to the habitat did not  change the extinction risk (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Roy Nielsen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) found southern Indiana Swamp Rabbits existed as a metapopulation  that appeared to be stable. Metapopulation dynamics were best  characterized as being stationary, but habitat area was an important  factor in extinction rates, occupied patches were significantly larger  than unoccupied patches. In Missouri, more than 50% of available habitat  patches were predicted to contain rabbits after 1000 years, both patch  area and patch isolation were significantly related to patch occupancy  and play key roles in the incidence of Swamp Rabbits (Pajda-De La O <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Decreasing,"Swamp Rabbits occur in the southeastern United States in eastern Texas  and Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, the  western tip of the Florida panhandle, western Georgia, western  Tennessee, far western Kentucky, the northwestern tip of South Carolina,  the southwestern tip of North Carolina, far southern Illinois,  southwestern Indiana, and the south sections of Missouri (Nielsen and  Berkman 2018).<br/><br/>There are two recognized subspecies of Swamp  Rabbits: <em>S. a. littoralis</em>, which occurs in a narrow fragment of habitat  along the southern gulf coastal from Mississippi to Texas, and<em> S. a.  aquaticus</em>, which occupies the northern section of the range and is more  common in dense forest (Chapman and Feldhamer 1981, Chapman and Ceballos  1990).","The species is hunted for sport, meat and fur.",Terrestrial,"Hunting of Swamp Rabbits is managed individually by state wildlife  agencies (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). Because Swamp Rabbits occurs in  many instances on small tracts of private land, management becomes  problematic (Scheibe and Henson 2003). Increasing the area of continuous  tracts of suitable habitat may be key to Swamp Rabbit conservation  (Scheibe and Henson 2003, Fantz <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Swamp  Rabbits are currently found in three managed areas in Missouri: Mingo  National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Duck Creek Conservation Area, and  Donaldson Point Conservation Area (Scheibe and Henson 2003).

Much of its range is in China, which has regionally assessed the Tolai Hare as Least Concern (Wang and Xie 2004; Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016). However, data on Tolai Hare populations are lacking, and the increased human population and concomitant habitat loss may be instrumental in causing a decline in the Tolai Hare; studies are needed to accurately determine the status of this species.","The Tolai Hare inhabits semi-desert, mountain-steppe, forest steppe, and rocky habitats (Tsevegmid and Tsendjav 2004, Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994). It also occurs in grasslands and forest meadows (Smith and Xie 2008). The Tolai Hare does not occupy true forests. It is a nocturnal species (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994, Smith and Xie 2008). Diet consists of roots, grass, and other herbaceous plants (Smith and Xie 2008). Tolai Hares take shelter under shrubs, under rocks, or by digging shallow pits. When fleeing predators they run in a straight line, and are able to jump a length of 2.5–3m (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Hunting (for meat, skins, and for traditional medicines) has been identified as a threat to the Tolai Hare in Mongolia (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006).","In Mongolia, populations are characterized as large, with no apparent decline (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006). In Russia, the population density can reach 10–30 individuals per 100ha (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994). One study looked at Mongolian commercial harvest data obtain from Dornad Aimag between 1932-1993, which did not indicate any apparent change in Tolai Hare takes (Reading <em>et al.</em> 1998). The authors specify that the data may or may not provide a valid indication of population trends (Reading <em>et al.</em> 1998). In southern Uzbekistan, pelt takes decreased from 8,751 in 1959 to 595 in 1977 (Volozheninov 1980).

This species was observed at an elevation of 2,400 m on Yihe-Bogdo, Mongolia (Ognev 1966).

45196929,4806,Chrotogale owstoni,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered A2bcd, A3bcd, A4cd because of an ongoing population decline, inferred to exceed 50% over the last three generations (taken as 15 years) and suspected to continue for the next three. This is inferred from over-exploitation, with habitat fragmentation exacerbating the speed at which the species is being extirpated. Hunting is a severe threat because the species is primarily ground-dwelling and so is exposed to the very high levels of snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping throughout its range. This assessment is made without any direct quantification of decline rate. Two largely sympatric ungulates&#160;of broadly similar generation lengths, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, are proposed as Critically Endangered under the same criteria for the same reasons. Owston's Civet has always been and remains more widespread than them, and unlike them there is still evidence of&#160;several&#160;high-density&#160;Owston's Civet&#160;populations. While this does not necessarily mean the civet's overall population decline rate is lower, the lower category for Owston's Civet is assigned based on its wider occurrence in montane forest (in which this civet is known to live, in some areas commonly, and up to 2,600 m) and karst (which is predicted to hold viable populations). These habitats, which contain some areas of very rugged and/or highland terrain into which industrial snaring has not yet widely spread, are apparently not occupied by the two ungulates. If market forces drive intensive snaring also into these habitats, then Critically Endangered would be the appropriate category for future decline rates of Owston's Civet given its apparent rapid extirpation across some heavily snared parts of Viet Nam.","Owston’s Civet occurs in a variety of habitats, all within evergreen biomes, linked by the common feature of a non-harsh dry season. It is, or was, much more widely spread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, reflecting the much larger area of Viet Nam with significant humidity in the driest months (i.e., lacking a harsh dry season).&#160;The pattern of locality records in Lao PDR where the species is evidently naturally localised&#160;quite clearly shows that the species has a narrow&#160;habitat usage. Areas with&#160;a non-harsh dry season&#160;in Lao PDR are restricted (Timmins and Trinh 2001).&#160;The areas providing high encounter rates of Owston's Civet in Lao PDR are adjacent to low sections of the Annamite spine (the north-south mountain range forming much of the international border between Lao PDR and Viet Nam) that allow moisture-bearing winds from Viet Nam during Lao PDR's dry season, which in the rest of the country is harsh at lower and mid altitudes (Timmins and Trinh 2001, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Sivilay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Many other evergreen forest survey areas across the country lack records,&#160;despite the use therein of methods suitable to find the species, at adequate intensities, and the finding of multiple hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling mammals,&#160;It is essentially absent from the predominant evergreen forest types of Lao PDR, lowland, mid-elevation and lower montane semi-evergreen (dry evergreen) and lower montane forests. This is based on spotlighting in several survey areas supporting these forest types in the early - mid 1990s (Duckworth 1997) and on camera-trapping in the 21st century in Phou Sithon, Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), Laving-Laveun NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area and Xe Sap NBCA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the hunting intensity in all of these at the time of camera-trapping was equivalent to Pu Mat before (sometimes well before) 1998, about when the species was still readily detected by camera-traps. It is evidently locally present in Lao PDR below 1,000 m where wet evergreen forest occurs, but the absence of records from Laving-Laveun NBCA, which holds various other wet&#160;evergreen forest species,&#160;suggests that Owston's Civet is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. It also occurs in montane evergreen forest (over 1,000 m), but is probably equally restricted by climatic conditions in its geographic and altitudinal range. Montane areas&#160;with wet climates, such as various high peaks in eastern parts of Lao PDR, appear to support the species over a relatively wide range (e.g., Xe Sap NBCA; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whilst peaks further west (greater rain-shadowing during the winter) appear to support more localised populations (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wet evergreen forest is, or was, far more widespread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, but it is not universal. The strong evidence from Lao PDR for climatic sensitivity of Owston's Civet suggests that some Viet Namese evergreen forests will hold the species sparsely or not at all (those in a&#160;rain-shadow).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Annamite wet evergreen forest of Lao PDR, Owston's Civet has been recorded as high as suitable survey has occurred (1,500 m; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The few records from Lao PDR's northern highlands, mostly imprecisely located (barring that in Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009), are likely to come from higher altitudes where the colder temperatures ameliorate the low dry-season rainfall. Thus, in Lao PDR Owston's Civet is likely to occur&#160;mostly in hill and montane altitudes, although there are credible reports from as low as 550 m (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whereas in Viet Nam the species has a wide altitudinal range, right down to the plains and up to 2,600 m (Van Ban district, Lao Kay province, in 2002; S. Swan pers. comm. 2014). Recent camera-trap records at&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, in the northern highlands of Viet Nam, come from altitudes of 1,722-2,444 m a.s.l.; there was very little survey effort below 1,700 m (B.M. Rawson pers, comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Captive animals in both Viet Nam and the U.K. relish earthworms (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014) and the species's skull and dentition suggest an invertebrate diet (Thomas 1927). An earthworm-dominated diet would explain the tight linkage with year-round humidity, given that in the parts of Lao PDR with a harsh dry season earthworms are not accessible during that season. This remains purely speculative, especially given that the component of Owston's Civet range south of the northern highlands resembles that of various other species unlikely to depend directly on access to earthworms, e.g. Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>&#160;and Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>.<br/><br/>Suitable forests, in Viet Nam at least, include some on limestone and some dominated by bamboo (Roberton 2007). There are indications from Lao PDR of occurrence in degraded and edge habitat such as banana gardens (King 2002), but these remain to be confirmed. The lack of records from deciduous forest surely reflects the genuine pattern of occurrence.<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has not been studied in the field, but camera-trapping indicates that it is nocturnal, largely solitary and presumably largely active at ground level (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), although there is at least one record of a wild animal 3 m up a tree (Dang and Le 2010). The species climbs well in captivity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).","Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the two countries holding most of the geographic range of Owston's Civet, have among the highest levels of non-specific mammal hunting in the world. For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats <em>Panthera</em>, wild cattle <em>Bos</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs,&#160;rather than by passive trapping; and it is&#160;by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.<br/><br/>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.<br/><br/>The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the&#160;species&#160;depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.","The total population of Owston's Civet will always have been much smaller than that of most other mainland South-east Asian civets because it has such a small geographic range. There is insufficient&#160;baseline information to define the precise&#160;range and even the general abundance in the era before trade-driven hunting began to accelerate steeply in the 1980s with the increasingly wide deployment of cable-snares in long lines linked by brushwood drift fences. Therefore, its population trend needs to be inferred from trends in habitat and in hunting (types, distributions and intensities), based on a hypothesised geographic and ecological distribution, itself inferred from habitat (from which the known precisely located records come) and distributions of ecologically restricted co-occurring species.<br/><br/>Severe declines probably started in the early 1990s, Around this time, evidence suggests other ground-dwelling, now much-declined, Annamite-centred species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> and&#160;Edwards’s Pheasant <em>Lophura edwardsii</em>&#160;were, by today’s standards, still common in accessible Viet Namese forests. Camera-trapping in the late 1990s in Pu Mat Nature Reserve and in Huong Son district (SFNC 2000, Timmins and Trinh 2001) suggested that the species was still relatively common in mid-elevation forests where hunting pressure was already relatively intense. The number of animals in trade in the 1990s (e.g., at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in Lao PDR; received by the Owston’s Civet Project at&#160;Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam; and observed in trade near Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and as&#160;stuffed specimens along route 1, both Viet Nam) all suggest the species was frequent thereabouts, presumably in the mid-elevation forest where the bulk of snaring was then taking place. There is no pointer, when the difficulties of detecting this species by typical pre-camera-trap surveys are accounted for, to suggest that Owston’s Civet was not a common species throughout mid-elevation Vietnamese wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section), prior to the advent of intensive snaring.<br/><br/>Within its range, it evidently reached, and locally still reaches, high densities within favoured habitat. Bourret (1944) considered it to be the most common civet between the Fansipan mountains and the Black river in northern Viet Nam. Two camera-trapping surveys in Viet Nam around the turn of the century, one in the Hoang Lien mountains in the north-west of the country and the other in Pu Mat Nature Reserve in the northern Annamites found this civet to be among the most commonly photographed small carnivores in these areas (SFNC 2000, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004). Pu Mat NR has not been resurveyed, but this assessment&#160;is still appropriate for the highland areas of Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, both in/near the Hoan Lien mountains, in 2013 camera-trapping (B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). The same was found in 2012-2013 in Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b) and during the preceding decade in parts of eastern Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In some other areas that it has been found, it has been among the least recorded species by camera-trap, e.g. Quang Nam province, Viet Nam (Long and Minh 2006), western Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Nam Et-Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The patterns&#160;of the other hunting-sensitive species recorded by these surveys suggest that Owston's Civet abundance is highly heterogeneous dependent upon habitat, not that the low encounter rates in these areas are&#160;solely a result of overhunting (although this&#160;might be responsible in part or whole for the low encounter rate in Quang Nam).<br/><br/>However, hunting is likely to be the explanation for the stark temporal pattern shown by the review of camera-trapping in Viet Nam by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Of the five camera-trapping surveys operating in Viet Nam during&#160;1998–2006, all found Owston’s &#160;Civet; the four in 2006–2013 all did not. (Two additional sites surveyed in the latter period, Cat Tien NP and U Minh, also did not find&#160;Owston’s Civet but are excluded from the comparison as being outside the species's likely range.) Very recent (late 2013) camera-trapping in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve (Kon Tum province, Viet Nam) and two northern highland sites,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, found Owston's Civet to be one of most commonly photographed small carnivores (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014,&#160;B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). These anomalies within the 2006-2013 time period, not available in time for the Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) review, are both in very mountainous areas consequently less economically appealing to market hunters. Higher hunting pressures, notably snaring intensities, typify most of the survey areas included in Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Excepting the results from Ngoc Linh NR,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, the lack of Viet Namese records from 2006 onwards suggests a major recent decline in the species in sites across the country with large populations&#160;left only in forested steep highland massifs. This suspected decline&#160;is corroborated by the failure of over 15,000 camera-trap-nights of effort in wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves, Viet Nam, since August 2012 to find the species (WWF pers. comm. to Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Nor has it been found in another lowland area of wet&#160;evergreen forest, Khe Nuoc Truong in Quang Binh province, where extensive camera-trapping recorded many other small carnivore species (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014). For none of these 2006-2013 Viet Nam camera-trap survey areas is there evidence of a pre-intensive-snaring large population of Owston' Civet. However, assessing them based on habitat and other Annamite wet evergreen forest species' status (see 'Habitats and ecology' section; R.J. Timmins [pers. comm. 2014] has&#160;surveyed in most of them and studied all on aerial imagery), Khe Nuoc Truong, Hoang Son, and non-limestone forests in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang area,&#160;are&#160;probably&#160;prime Owston’s Civet habitat; Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves are very similar to Pu Mat NR; and Ke Go is hard to know, because few other sites are topographically similar, and the topography influences local climate. Even Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>&#160;(among the least hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling wet evergreen forest species)&#160;has not been camera-trapped in the&#160;Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves;&#160;they are some of the most heavily hunted large forest blocks that R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014) has&#160;ever been to.<br/><br/>A decline of such magnitude was not suspected during the last Red List assessment for this species, for 2008. At that stage, all camera-trap surveys within its range typically found the species, sometimes commonly. The high encounter rates in some areas suggests a high starting population and thus a long time until near extirpation (and the concomitant ability of generalised camera-trapping to note a paucity of records). Another factor weighed for the 2008 listing as Vulnerable was that one of the surveys camera-trapping the species commonly, in Hoang Lien Son of far northern Viet Nam, was amid highly degraded and fragmented forest which had been subjected to high levels of traditional hunting for decades (see Swan and O'Reilly 2004) and thus the species was resilient to hunting pressure. However, it now seems more likely that Owston's Civet differs in sensitivity to different styles of hunting (see 'Threats'). The current overall population trend is thus assessed to be steeply downwards. Probably, the main phase of decline in Viet Nam has already occurred, with most areas holding the species there now having only low numbers with large populations persisting only in the northern highlands and most rugged part of the Annamites, Lao PDR, retaining much larger areas of forest without road incursion and a much lower human population, still retains at least one large population, plausibly several (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), but the national trend in 2015-2030 is likely to replicate that of Viet Nam in 1999-2014.<br/><br/>No information on the present population status in the Chinese part of the range was traced. Indeed, it is not clear that the species is still extant there.",Decreasing,"Owston's Civet is known to occur across a wide latitudinal range of both eastern Lao PDR (Sivilay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) and Viet Nam (Roberton&#160;2007,&#160;Dang and Le 2010), and in a small area of southernmost China, possibly only in Hekou, Luchun and Jinping counties of Yunnan province (Wang Ying-xiang 2003) but perhaps also in adjacent Guangxi province (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has not been found west of the Mekong river (Corbet and Hill 1992) and indeed occurrence in Lao PDR is restricted largely to the easternmost areas that have similarities in climate to Viet Nam. The range may also potentially extend into easternmost Cambodia: two individuals seen in the Phnom Tamao zoo (Phnom Penh) collection of stuffed mounts in the late 1990s were unlikely to have originated outside Cambodia (C.M. Poole pers. comm. to Dang and Le 2010). However, extensive surveys in Cambodia's eastern provinces have not found the species (e.g., Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, E.H.B. Pollard pers. comm. 2012). Perhaps the most likely area of Cambodia, eastern Virachey National Park, remains very little camera-trapped. Suitable methodology (camera-trapping and/or spotlighting) has been applied widely enough in the southern half of Lao PDR to be confident the species is entirely or largely restricted to the east in the south and latitudinal centre; capable searches have been less widespread in the northern highlands.<br/><br/>Records come from the range 100-2,600 m, but, particularly west of the Annamites, only a subset of this full range is likely to be occupied in any given area (see 'Habitats and ecology').","Owston's Civet is taken for meat and traditional medicine (including its bones, scent gland, and penis) in all of its range countries; there is not suspected to be any targeted hunting of the species, but much hunting in its range is non-selective (e.g. snares) to supply the general wildlife meat market (Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;B.

Indeed, the population is stable to increasing, after former&#160;steep declines in&#160;some of its range.","Pine Marten inhabits deciduous, mixed and coniferous woodlands, as well as scrub. Optimal habitat appears to be woodlands with an incomplete canopy and dense understorey vegetation. The decade to 2014 provided various records&#160;in big cities&#160;such as&#160;Minsk, Moscow, Kirov, Vologda, Ivanovo, Yaroslavl', Yekaterinburg, Ul'anovsk and besides Barnaul, Krasnodar and Temirtau. In Russia martens are considered to be the major source of rabies to humans after dogs and foxes&#160;(Canidae) (D.&#160;Skumatov pers. comm. 2014)..<br/>Pine Marten is predominantly carnivorous, consuming voles, mice, squirrels, rabbits, birds, and amphibians. Carrion is a major food source in the winter. Bees' nests, mushrooms, and berries are also sometimes eaten. It is&#160;solitary, but not highly territorial. The home ranges often overlap partly or even totally. A female may mate with several males while on heat. There is delayed implantation by 165-210 days.<br/>In the eastern parts of its&#160;distribution it can hybridise with Sable  <em>Martes zibellina</em> (A.V.

This&#160;marten is hunted and trapped for its fur in some parts of its range. Its decline in Britain was because of&#160;persecution as a predator of livestock and, particularly, of game, and the species is still subject to persecution even in some countries in which it is protected. Efforts to control other carnivore species sometimes result in Pine Marten deaths.","In the more northern and eastern parts of its range Pine Marten remains widespread, and it is in total numerous&#160;because of&#160;its large range. Population declines and range contractions have occurred in many parts of its distribution, but these are&#160;difficult to quantify because historical data are imprecise&#160;for many range states. Hunting bags in Russia were 80% lower in the late 20th century than they were in the 1920s (Grakov 1993);&#160;since 1990, in the Russian Federation the population has been increasing again in forested areas. In 1999 the number was estimated as 170,000 (A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2006). The average annual&#160;spring number of Pine Martens&#160;in Russia (which constitutes a large part of the species's&#160;range) at the beginning of the century was as follows: 165,800 in 2000-2003; 193,450 in 2004-2007; 204,000 in 2008-2010; and 187,000 in 2011-2013 (V.G.

In Kazakhstan&#160;Pine Marten has been recorded&#160;along the northern border from Bolshoi Uzen’ river in the west to Semey city in the east and along Ural (Jaik) river from middle reaches (Uralsk city) to the delta (Atyrau city).

In the last ten years (a period exceeding three generations) this is inferred to have resulted in the loss of over half the population, and it is predicted to intensify in the next&#160;ten years&#160;to result in a decline rate exceeding 80% because of habitat degradation/loss and the effects of introduced species, notably American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>.","European Mink has&#160;specialised habitat requirements. It is&#160;semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of rivers, streams and sometimes, during the warm season, it may inhabit lake-banks. It is rarely found more than 100 meters away from fresh water. There are no records of its presence on sea coast.&#160;It hunts&#160;both in riparian zones and in the water for amphibians, crustaceans (crayfish), fish, small mammals, insects and birds (Sidorovich <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998, Maran <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998; Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2008). Females become mature for the next breeding season at 11 months (T. Maran unpublished).","The decline and extinction of the European Mink cannot be explained with a single universal factor. The main factors operating the extinction have been (1) habitat loss, (2) over-exploitation and (3) impact of alien American Mink.<br/><br/>In the European continent, human activities have resulted in large-scale alteration of landscapes, which has had a substantial impact on various habitats and their species. The European Mink has proved to be sensitive to human-induced environmental change and disturbance. As the type and extent of human influence on the species and its biotope has varied in time and between regions in Europe, also the set of factors contributing to the extinction has varied.<br/><br/>Several factors have often been acting in concert with a cumulative effect. The course of decline during the first half of 20th century in central regions of Russia is a perfect illustration of this. There, the effect of over-exploitation was noticed almost throughout the entire European Mink range (this even resulted in a moratorium of hunting in several regions and even in reinforcement efforts in Yaroslavl Region, where around 130 European Minks&#160;were translocated with the hope to recover the original, depleted population). In addition, extensive change of habitats in the mid-20th century further contributed to the decline. Thereafter, the invasion of the American Mink posed a very serious threat to the native mink. Large-scale introductions&#160;of American Mink in Russia, first planned to be conducted only in regions outside the European Mink's natural range, were ultimately performed also inside the native mink range. The reason for this was twofold: (1) the original mink has become too scarce for the fur-trapping industry, (2) higher value of American Mink fur in the market (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). In these times, the American Mink and European Mink were not regarded by the relevant authorities to be two distinct species. In the course of the introduction operation, 20,400 American Mink were released in the USSR until 1971, with around 4,000 of them being released into the range of the European Mink (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). The intentional introduction of the alien species was strongly supported by rapidly developing mink fur-farming in the Soviet Union – escapees from farms formed a continuous source of new founders for introduction. American Mink farming started in the 1920s; in 1972, 1.9 million female American Minks&#160;were kept in fur-farms and in 1973, 4.9 million minks&#160;were raised in 146 farms in the former Soviet Union (Abramov 1974). As the native mink populations were small and highly fragmented by over-exploitation and habitat loss, the fur-farm escapees, being ecologically more flexible (Maran 1991) easily invaded into the freely available ecological niche, thus making it impossible for the depleted European Mink to recover. Even more, the remaining European Mink groups were an easy target for intra-guild aggression (Maran <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991, 1998; Sidorovich <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, 2001). The magnitude of the effect of mink farming on the native mink is well illustrated by a recent study in Denmark (a country with a very high number of mink farms), which concludes that 86% of free-living American Minks&#160;are escapees from farms (Hammershoj <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>Local key factors have changed with time also in many other countries. For instance the impact of over-hunting and/or habitat change weakened the populations and accelerated the impact of the subsequent spread of the American Mink and/or the impact of other factors. It might well be that sometimes the interchange of key factors in time and/or the concurrent impact of several factors has led to a synergistic effect on the European Mink. Further, the time from the introduction of the threat to the extinction of the species can be highly variable, resulting in the so-called extinction or decline lag (Baillie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). This, along with the interwoven effect of numerous factors, is likely to result in situations when it is hard or, in some cases, even impossible to identify the actual causes behind the extinction process.<br/><br/>The role of the alien American Mink deserves a special attention. Its role has been noted in several reports as a secondary or unimportant factor, usually emphasising that the decline of the European Mink started before the invasion of American Mink (Lodé 2002, Lodé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Rozhnov 1992, Schubnikova 1982). Still, there are several records of local extinction of the European Mink concurrent with rapid expansion of the American Mink, e.g., in Estonia, Tver Region in Russia, Basque country (Zadorra river basin and Cantabric rivers in Bizkaia province) in Spain, Belarus (Maran 1991,&#160;Sidorovich 1991, 1993;&#160;Katchanovsky 2002, Palazón&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2004;&#160;Põdra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2013, A Gomez pers. comm, 2014). The former range of European Mink included a number of large nature reserves where habitat alteration and hunting were minimal or absent (Maran <em>et al</em>, 1998, Maran 1992). Further, although there are 'time-shot' records on the co-existence of the two mink species, no records demonstrating long-term sympatric coexistence of the two mink species have been found. Numerous records reveal the local replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink, but no opposite events have been reported. Records on replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink are further supported by studies of behavioural interactions between the two mink species in the wild and well as in experimental conditions. All this evidences that the American Mink has played a special role in the demise of the European Mink. While most of the other agents which have been operating the extinction are relatively easy to stop by conventional conservation management, there is very little one can do to prevent the spread of the alien American Mink. This means that the presence of the American Mink in wide territories across Europe makes the efforts for species recovery a very complicated task.<br/><br/>A new complication is the rising trend for private individuals in France&#160;to keep&#160;American Mink&#160;as a pet.<br/><br/>In addition to the main factors behind the decline of European Mink populations, a number of other factors may pose local threat the remaining small populations, like hybridisation, road casualties, Aleutian disease and secondary poisoning.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is still a serious threat especially in western populations, both in France and in Spain (mostly in Cantabric rivers).","Its range has reduced by over 85% since the mid-19th century. The remaining population is small, fragmented and declining. The most viable population in Western Europe is in the Danube Delta. The current European Mink range in Russia consists of isolated distant habitats patches of different size. These fragmented populations are scattered across western Russia, the Urals, and the northern Caucasus. The only parts of the range where the American Mink is absent are rivers in the Archangelsk Region and Komi Republic,&#160;and probably also in the Northern Caucasus. Everywhere else the populations of European Mink are vanishing or becoming increasingly fragmented and localised. The Russian population of European Mink has been estimated at about&#160;20,000 (Tumanov 2003, 2006), but this is not based on quantitative data because no large-scale census has been undertaken. Hunting bags suggest that the European Mink is rapidly becoming less abundant compared with the American Mink: for instance, in Vologda and Kostroma regions, the proportion of European Mink skins in the hunting bag of the two mink species decreased from 50–70% to 1–10% within the 5–7 years to 2006. For the whole of Russia, recent records refer only to the capture of single individuals or to local populations consisting of some tens&#160;of individuals (Skumatov and Saveljev 2006). The number of 20,000 Minks&#160;in Russia is a clear and extensive overestimate of the present population size.<br/><br/>Because of intensive American Mink control measures since 2003, the population in Spain (in the Mediterranean basin) was quite stable until 2010-2011. The main part of the population is in the Ebro river basin. Remarkable fragmentation has been observed in Cantabric rivers in the north (Basque Country). In 2011-2014, the fragmentation of European Mink population was observed also in the upper Ebro River as a result of American Mink invasion into the area (Asun Gomez &amp; Madis Põdra pers. comm. 2014). At the same time, a slight expansion of the range to south and south-east was observed in Aragon in Ebro River basin (Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The overwhelming majority of remaining populations are in decline and of low density. Therefore the size of the species's&#160;range leads to overestimation the population status. It is likely that the overall number of Mink declined more than 90% since the beginning of 20th century. Also, the presence of the American Mink in most of range fragments confuses the reports and makes the status projections to the future rather pessimistic.<br/><br/>Some national estimates of population abundance:<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spain</span>:&#160;Fewer than 2,000 km of rivers occupied, probably near 500 individuals (Asun Gomez <em>et al</em>. in prep.).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">France</span>: status unknown, the latest data available date back to 2004, when the population was estimated to be around few hundred individuals.

The American Mink is now present within the whole remaining range of the European Mink, although it may be absent or very&#160;scarce&#160;in Northern Caucasus and in the north - approximately 64°–66°N, 44°–52°E (near Timanskiy kriazh, to Arctic circle).&#160;The most recent evidence of European Mink (2010-2014) comes from Krasnodar Region (2013), Tver Region (2012), Kostroma Region (2013), Vologda Region (2011) and Arkhangelsk (2014). It is believed that&#160;European Mink&#160;might still be found in Ivanovo Region, Yaroslav Region and Stavropol Region. In Arkhangelsk Region, a trail camera caught mostly European Mink in 2010, while by 2014 the majority of animals caught by the trap were already American Mink. &#160;The same applies to Komi Republic: in 2000 only European Mink was recorded, in 2011-2014 the American Mink became prevailing species.</li><li><strong>Estonia</strong>: the last wild individual was trapped in 1996.

Only Romania can, perhaps, be regarded as an exception. In Romania, the presence of the European Mink in Danube Delta was confirmed relatively recently (Gotea and Kranz 1999).&#160;The results of an IUCN mission in 2014 to Romania showed that the Danube delta population is clearly the most viable in the world: according to the assessment, the population in delta might be around 1,000 – 1,500 individuals. There is some information about the presence of the European Mink also in the Romanian Carpathians. In the Moscow region, the species was present in at least two locations until 1994 (Dinets 1995), but a snow-tracking survey of these locations found no European Minks in 1997 (V. Dinets pers. comm. 2015).&#160;In the Vologoda Region, considering the rapid decline of the species in the neighbouring regions and the presence of the American Mink, it is not likely that the European Mink populations will hold there for long. In the Arkhangelsk Region, a population seems to exist in the north-west of the region, which is close to the northern limit of the range, with very low abundance. The presence of the American Mink (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neovison vison</span>) is likely to pose a serious threat to its long-term existence also there (Skumatov 2005, Maran 2007 and references therein). In 1981-1989, the European Mink was introduced to southern Kurile Islands (Kunashir, Iturup), Russia, far away from the native distribution range. This introduction was unsuccessful; no stable populations were established in these islands (A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Michaux <em>et al</em>. (2005: 2382), concerning the low genetic diversity in French and Spanish populations, speculated as follows: “The almost complete lack of variation observed in French and Spanish animals strongly indicates that very few individuals established the present-day W European population, possibly following a human introduction”. This wording has been often misread, resulting in misleading statements about an alien origin of European Mink in Spain and in France (e.g. in Clavero 2013, Carbonell 2015). As Diez-Leon <em>et al</em>. (2014) argued, the very low level of genetic diversity in western population provides no scientific ground to conclude &#160;that the European Mink is introduced by humans to Spain and France, and no other line of evidence suggests&#160;this.<br/><br/>It occurs from sea level to 1,120 m (Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).","<p>The species was largely in the fur trade during the first half of the 20th century. As of 2014, there are no data on present trade. The higher quality of farmed American Mink fur makes it highly unlikely that the trading could become an issue in European Mink conservation. Some recent illegal fur trade to neighbouring countries from Romania has stopped, because the fur-markets in these countries have crashed.&#160;It is still caught in small numbers in Russia by trappers hunting for American Mink.</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"European Mink is legally protected in all range states (Schreiber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1989).

New studies have been launched to study reproductive physiology, impact of captive conditions, options for artificial insemination, effect of behavioural personality types in mink to conservation breeding and reintroduction. There is an urgent need for species action plan in European Union for European Mink for better collaboration between different on-going conservation activities.  Clearly national and regional authorities need to increase attention and allocate sufficient and continued resources for European Mink conservation, otherwise this species will disappear soon. There is a need for large-scale coordinated efforts to secure the survival of the last small remaining populations in different areas inside of the historical range of the species, but also restoration and/or establishment of new populations is required.&#160;<br/><br/>Conservation breeding of the species needs all-European coordination so that all single-country initiatives collaborate. The current tendency for isolated one-country breeding efforts leads&#160;to ineffective use of resources and of competence, and also to the inability to reach a captive population size sufficient to maintain genetic diversity in captivity. For remaining in situ populations, the maintenance or restoration of sufficiently large areas of suitable habitats has to be secured by designation of new protected areas and improvement of management of existing protected areas. <br/><br/>The impact of the American Mink on local European Mink populations has to be monitored and controlled, and whenever possible and feasible the alien mink populations should be removed. Local authorities have to pay more attention to the effects of the American Mink on the local fauna, including the European Mink. They should support further studies and actions to mitigate the effect of alien mink to the native mink species. For example, intensive control of American Mink is on-going in Spain since 2003. More than 5,500 American Minks have been eradicated around and inside the European Mink distribution area. It is likely that without such a control of alien mink the native mink population in Spain would have vanished already (Gomez and Palazon pers. comm.). A recent boom in the mink-farm industry driven by increased market in China combined with the prohibition of mink-farming in several European countries has resulted in increasing interest in establishment of mink farms including in sites in or close to remaining European Mink areas, such as in Spain and in Romania.<br/><br/>For French and Spanish wild populations which appear to be highly inbred, further research needs to be carried out to identify whether these seemingly genetically highly uniform populations suffer from inbreeding depression. The introduction of individuals from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> stock from genetically diverse eastern populations has to be considered as a potential conservation measure, if further research confirms the need for this. In addition to genetic studies, comparative studies on ecology and behaviour of the disjunct mink populations (Spanish/French, Romanian and eastern European) should also be conducted to support the findings of genetic studies. The <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ </span>conservation breeding programme has to be enhanced and promoted, as it guarantees the survival of the species in case <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in situ</span> efforts temporarily fail. It also provides opportunities for the restoration of already vanished wild populations and reinforcement of existing populations whenever needed. Better coordination between different <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> actions over political borders is needed. Special studies have to be conducted to find the most feasible way how to incorporate the western low-variability populations into the joint programme with the high-diversity eastern population.&#160; <br/><br/>There is also a need for developing an all-European conservation breeding programme with secured long-term funding. Further studies are needed about the current&#160;status of the European Mink in Romania, Russia,&#160;Ukraine and elsewhere in the eastern part of Europe.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

45201218,14027,Mustela strigidorsa,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Stripe-backed Weasel is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in many protected areas, and apparent tolerance to high levels of habitat modification and hunting pressure. Although forest clearance rate are heavy in South-east Asia, they are considerably lower in hill forests (the main habitat of this species) than in the level lowlands (where it is rare); similarly, trade-driven hunting is least pervasive in such habitats. Because of these factors, it is unlikely to be declining at the rate required for listing even as Near Threatened.","Stripe-backed Weasel probably lives mainly in evergreen forests in hills and mountains, but has been recorded from other biotopes including dense scrub, secondary forest, grassland and farmland (Abramov <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Most records come from in or near larger extents of high elevation (1,000 m+) terrain. It sometimes occurs well below 1,000 m in such areas (down almost to sea-level in Viet Nam), but there are no records, except in Viet Nam, from lower elevations in areas away from high altitude terrain (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is probably diurnal and mostly solitary. Conventional camera-trapping is not particularly efficient at finding it even when it is&#160;known by other methods to be present (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).","Although Stripe-backed Weasel was usually perceived as a species under threat, this stems from the limited relevant survey effort for most of the 20th century across most of its range. Even though this weasel lacks high economic value, and villagers in at least central Lao PDR say it has a bad taste and smell (C.N.Z. Coudrat pers. comm. 2014), hunting could in theory drive declines because many harvest methods (notably snares) used widely in its range are non-selective. As remaining natural habitats are yet further encroached, the proportion of the species’s occupied area in which it faces such threats will increase. However, the number of records from areas with already high hunting pressure indicate a resilience to such activities (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2008, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3).&#160;This does not mean that hunting-driven declines might not be occurring locally; this is most likely to be so in Viet Nam, looking at patterns of ground-level snaring pressure. Even in this case, the paucity of salvage records from snare lines suggests that weasels are only rarely caught: plausibly they move through the brush-wood drift fences (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and, given that the snare-lines usually run across relatively open understorey, weasels perhaps avoid these areas anyway (D.H.A. Willcox&#160;pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Ongoing forest encroachment is fairly heavy across the species's range, but the locations&#160;of records suggest the species is fairly tolerant to degradation and fragmentation. While there are no records from entirely deforested landscapes, because this seems to be primarily a species of hill evergreen forest, range-wide total forest clearance rates are low.","In view of the overall rather limited survey effort in much of its range, the number of recent records of Stripe-backed Weasel indicates that it is less rare than previously believed (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2008).  Globally, there are several dozen historical specimens, their number significantly under-estimated in various 1960s-1990s texts thereby giving a misleading impression of rarity. Recent sight-records strongly support the notion that it was previously much overlooked (e.g. Abramov&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Notably, in Lao PDR, this species was historically found only once, at Phongsali (Delacour 1940), but by contrast there are recent records from all but a couple of the blocks of hill semi-evergreen and evergreen forest which have had wildlife surveys exceeding a few weeks and using appropriate methodology (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tizard 2003, Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Streicher&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Stable,"Stripe-backed Weasel is found from Sikkim (India) east through southern China (Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces), North-east India and north and central South-east Asia to Viet Nam (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008). Formerly thought to be restricted in South-east Asia to the north and centre, a recent record from Thailand is from far to the south, near Kuiburi National Park at&#160;12°06′N, 99°44′E (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). It presumably occurs also in&#160;Bhutan, although&#160;Abramov&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no records from the country.&#160;As of late 2014, there are no records from Bangladesh (Hasan Rahman pers comm. 2014), although it seems likely to occur in the evergreen forests of the north-east.&#160;There are two old specimens catalogued as from ‘Nepal’ (i.e., west of the validated world range), but they probably did not come from within the boundaries of the modern country (Hinton and Fry 1923).&#160;Thapa (2014) listed the species for Nepal without caveat, but confirmed subsequently that he knows of no specific records from the country (S. Thapa pers. comm. 2014).&#160;This species has a wide recorded altitudinal range of 90 to 2,500 m (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008).","About 3,000 to 4,000&#160;Stripe-backed Weasel&#160;pelts were harvested annually in China in the 1970s, with 50 skins were purchased in Nanning, Guangxi, in 1973 (Sheng 1998). The skins/dried corpses were seen “2-5 times” (the middle class of frequency) in a survey of wildlife trade along the Yunnan-Viet Nam border in June-August 1997; the source was said to be Yunnan (Li and Wang 1999). Outside China, the species is sold at least occasionally in Lao PDR (Hansel and Tizard 2006) and Viet Nam. Outside China, the only occasional records of Stripe-backed Weasel in trade, or hunted and destined for local use. all indicate that across most of its range this weasel lacks high economic value and is not specifically sought.",Terrestrial,"There are no obvious conservation needs for Stripe-backed Weasel. Habitat-driven decline rates are fairly low, given its presence in degraded and fragmented forests and the high proportion of its population in hill and mountain areas with relatively low rates of forest conversion. Moreover, except possibly for pelts in China, it is not a targeted quarry species (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008). It has been recorded in many protected areas across its range and it is likely that it occurs, as yet undetected, in many of those so far remaining little surveyed (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Many of these protected areas have little real protection from hunting and small-scale habitat loss and in the long term, the species's chief conservation concern is probably the risk of insufficient real security of declared&#160;protected areas.&#160;It&#160;is listed as Endangered on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004) and is protected in Thailand.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It is a high-altitude specialist living in the cloud forest and paramo of the Andes at elevations over 1,300 m.

Five principal food categories were found in mountain coati diet: invertebrates, vertebrates, fruits, vegetable remains and undetermined food items (Rodríguez-Bolaños <em>et al</em>.&#160;2000). Higher detection frequencies occur near <em>Chusquea</em> stands in elevations near Bogota (J.F. González-Maya <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).

In many parts of the Andes, cloud forest is being converted to agriculture and the paramo is being planted with pine forest and other crops (Bisbal 1987). The species might be threatened, at least locally,&#160;by road-kills and killing by domestic animals,&#160;given that its range coincides with highly populated areas.","The population density and trend&#160;of the Western Mountain Coati is unknown, but it is considered to be common in certain areas of its range.

(2004), McFadden (2004), and de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. (2011). Pygmy Raccoon prefers mangrove stands and sandy areas, but it is&#160;also found in semi-evergreen and sub-deciduous tropical forests and agricultural areas. Abundance varies considerable across&#160;vegetation types. Most of the population lives in the&#160;coastal areas of the island, and a large proportion of the central part of the island is&#160;uninhabited or has only a&#160;very low density. Pygmy Raccoon may inhabit areas near human settlements, and/or paved and unpaved roads (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).<br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoon is mainly nocturnal, although it is not uncommon to see it during daylight (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005).  Generally it is solitary, but sometimes forms&#160;family groups (Jones and Lawlor 1965,&#160;Cuarón&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). McFadden and Meiri (2013) concluded that dwarfism in the Pygmy Raccoon may be an insular adaptation to the fewer resources found on Cozumel Island compared with the mainland.<br/><br/>It is omnivorous, with a preference for crabs followed by fruits, insects, crayfish, and small vertebrates (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006). The relevance of the different food items varies strongly&#160;between seasons and sites, and following major changes in habitat quality because of hurricanes (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The Pygmy Raccoon is particularly vulnerable to introduced pathogens and diseases such as mange, rabies and dog distemper from exotic animals (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, Mena 2007).  The parasites <em>Eimeria nutalli</em>, <em>Placoconus lotoris</em>, <em>Capillaria procyonis</em>, a&#160;<em>Physaloptera</em> sp., a mite in the family Listrophoridae, and a trematode in the family Heterophyidae have been collected from <em>P. pygmaeus&#160;</em>(McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005).  The identification of <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> in some Pygmy Raccoons suggests a recent spillover from domestic cats (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Pygmy Raccoon has been exposed to infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper and feline panleukopenia viruses (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  <br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoons share the same mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, suggesting a recent population bottleneck that might be related to a founder effect (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2008).","Cozumel Island has been substantially developed for tourism. Until about 2005, Cozumel was still relatively well-conserved, with close to 90% of the island covered by natural vegetation (Romero-Nájera 2004, Romero-Nájera <em>et al</em>. 2007), but the situation is deteriorating  rapidly. The interior of the island is less developed, but Pygmy Raccoon is rare or absent there (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  There is only a very small area of prime raccoon habitat and this is on the coast where most of the tourist development is taking place.<br/><br/>The expansion and widening of the road system is fragmenting the vegetation of the island in at least three areas (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). The widening of roads is potentially increasing their barrier effect and exacerbating their impact on the conservation of Pygmy Raccoon and other native species (de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). Most cases of Pygmy Raccoon mortality documented since 2001 have been the result of animals being run over by cars on the island's highways (García-Vasco 2005).<br/><br/>Alien invasive predators, such as the&#160;snake&#160;<em>Boa constrictor</em>, as well as domestic and feral dogs, may have an important impact on the Pygmy Raccoon population and it is confirmed that feral dogs predate them (Martínez-Morales and Cuarón 1999, García-Vasco 2005, Bautista 2006).  Additionally, introduced carnivores to the island could easily become a source of parasites and pathogens that could potentially affect negatively Pygmy Raccoon populations (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  The introduction of the closely related Northern Raccoon&#160;<em>P. lotor</em> (there are&#160;frequent vehicle ferries between the island and mainland),&#160;usually for pets, is a risk of genetic introgression and a potential source of parasites and pathogens (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Hurricanes are the main natural threat recognized for the Cozumel biota (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, Perdomo 2006, Barillas 2007, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  For Pygmy Raccoon, hurricanes cause drastic population decline, reduction in the proportion of juveniles, direct injury, and facilitate pathological change (Copa-Alvaro 2007, Mena 2007). The frequency, magnitude and duration of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin is increasing (Goldenberg <em>et al</em>. 2001), so they are an issue of major concern because there may be a synergistic effect with anthropogenic disturbance.<br/><br/>Hunting and collection of Pygmy Raccoons as pets is currently not an important threat.","All individuals comprise a single subpopulation.&#160;The total subpopulation estimate for&#160;<em>P. pygmaeus</em>, including juveniles, ranges from 323 (McFadden 2004) to 955 (Copa-Alvaro 2007). Considering that 59.4% of captured individuals are adults (McFadden and Mairi 2013), then the estimated number of mature individuals ranges from 192 to 567.&#160;During 2006, a total of 105 different known individuals, including juveniles, was&#160;caught, indicating a total population of at least this number (Copa-Alvaro 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>Density estimates vary between sites and years, and range from 12.4 to 112 individuals/km² (McFadden 2004,&#160;Copa-Alvaro 2007).<br/><br/>Male-female ratios are fairly balanced: McFadden&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) conducted a subsample survey at two sites and of the total 96 Pygmy Raccoons captured, there were 47 males and 49 females. However García-Vasco (2005) found the proportion lightly skewed to females, but not significantly different from 1:1.<br/><br/>The species is severely affected by hurricanes and the population size fluctuates around these events. Because total population size is already severely depressed by human activities, it is increasingly difficult for the species to recover following these natural disasters. After major hurricanes,&#160;Pygmy Raccoon&#160;density can decline at a particular site by as much as 60% and the proportion of juveniles in the population can diminish significantly (Copa-Alvaro 2007).  The impact of hurricanes might vary between regions or vegetation types on the island (Copa-Alvaro 2007).",Decreasing,"Pygmy Raccoon is confined to Cozumel Island (189 square miles; 488 km²)&#160;off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004).

It is&#160;often found in successional or forest-edge habitats, in scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks that have high densities of small mammals, especially <em>Microtus</em> and <em>Arvicola</em>&#160;voles (King 1983). Pulliainen (1999) stated that coniferous and mixed woodlands are preferred, but that many other habitats are used including tundra and the summits of fells and mountains. Dense forests and deserts are avoided (King 1983). Specifically in Mongolia, it inhabits&#160;taiga, forest-steppe and rocky parts of the semi-desert. It is a specialist predator of small mammals, but will occasionally feed on fruit, earthworms, insects, eggs, and birds (King 1983). Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). It is active day and night (King 1983). Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 ha for males, most often falling between 10 and 40 ha (King 1983).","On a range-wide scale, no major threats to the Stoat are known. Locally the species may be threatened by unrestricted trapping and habitat loss through timber harvest or natural disturbance (Fagerstone 1987). In the Iberian Peninsula the species is perhaps&#160;dependent on two vole&#160;<em>Arvicola</em> species, and these are declining, so loss of prey base might be a threat (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Habitat loss (e.g. as a result of urbanization: Pulliainen 1999) is also a problem in parts of the range. The species is commonly hunted in Russia, where there is also a limited fur trade (R. McDonald pers. comm. 2006). In western and central Europe, the Stoat was frequently hunted for its white winter fur (ermine) up until at least the 1930s, with c. 30,000 pelts sold in Finland alone during that decade (Pulliainen 1999). Availability of prey is the principal factor controlling population density (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999), but disease, parasites and other pressures can also contribute.","The Stoat's&#160;total adult population is evidently enormous, given its huge range in both Palaearctic and Nearctic.&#160;The density and structure of its&#160;populations are unstable, because of&#160;short life spans and high reproductive capacity. Populations are greatly influenced by fluctuations in prey supply, especially small mammals (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). Population fluctuations of&#160;Stoat and its prey tend to be more marked at more northerly latitudes (Pulliainen 1999), although fluctuations are also present&#160;in Spain (Blanco 1998, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In much of its range&#160;it is a widespread and common in suitable habitats.&#160;In France, it was declining, but now has stabilised as a result of full protection. In Spain it has been speculated that the population may be declining as a results of declines in the&#160;Southern Water Vole&#160;<em>Arvicola sapidus</em>&#160;(Palomo and Gisbert 2002), but the population trend has not been quantified in Spain or Portugal (Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It is abundant in north-western and central Mongolia, but is rare in the eastern plains (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980). However, in some parts of its range it is only recorded very rarely and&#160;seems genuinely to be&#160;scarce, notably the Himalayan&#160;subspecies, <em>M. e. ferghanae</em>&#160;(Kotia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).",Stable,"The Stoat has a&#160;circumboreal range across&#160;North America, Europe and Asia, from Greenland and the Canadian and Siberian Arctic islands south - with much variation - to about 35°N (King 1983, Fagerstone 1987). In North America, it is found throughout Alaska and Canada south through most of the northern United States to central California, northern Arizona (Berna 1991), northern New Mexico, Iowa, the Great Lakes region, Pennsylvania, and northern Virginia (Fagerstone 1987). In Europe, it is present as far south as 41°N in Portugal (Santos Reis 1983), and is found on most islands with the exception of Iceland, Svalbard, some small North Atlantic islands, and the Mediterranean islands. In mainland Asia, it occurs&#160;south in China to Heilongjiang, Nei Mongol, Jilin, Liaoning and southern Xinjiang provinces&#160;(Wang 2003). It has a restricted distribution in the Himalaya, where it is confined to the west, in Ladakh (India), Pakistan and Afghanistan (Roberts 1977, Habibi 2003, Kotia <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;In Japan, it is present in the central mountains (northern and central Japan Alps) to northern parts&#160;of Honshu (primarily above 1,200 m) and Hokkaido (Abe <em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). Lin and Harada (1998) indicated that they had discovered - but did not name - a new taxon of <em>Mustela</em>&#160;allied to <em>M. erminea</em>&#160;in Taiwan; however, this form is closer to (and probably within) Least Weasel <em>M. nivalis</em>&#160;(Abramov 2006).

Thus, the only criterion on which it might qualify as anything other than Least Concern would be A, rate of population decline. An accurate understanding of population trend&#160;is hindered by the high proportion of its range in remote areas and by the&#160;considerable&#160;population&#160;fluctuations&#160;it undergoes. There is good evidence from the westernmost part of its range of significant recent declines reflecting those of its major prey&#160;species&#160;(Šálek&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), and indications of&#160;shallow&#160;habitat-driven declines in China. However, it is believed to remain common across its&#160;Russian and central Asian&#160;range, which contains&#160;the&#160;large majority of its world population.&#160;Thus,&#160;it is considered&#160;unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category or even in Near Threatened. However, the information base for this categorisation is poor, and it is possible that with better understanding a&#160;Near Threatened categorisation might be found to be appropriate.","Steppe Polecat inhabits a variety of relatively dry habitats including steppes, semi-deserts, pastures, and cultivated fields (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999). In south Siberia it often occurs in wooded steppes. Its diet consists mainly of rodents (including susliks <em>Spermophilus</em>, marmots <em>Marmota</em>, and various genera of hamsters, gerbils and voles) and pikas <em>Ochotona</em>. It avoids forests and is primarily nocturnal.","In the western parts of the species's range, it is not intentionally hunted, although some are by-catch with other species, but it is locally heavily impacted by persecution.&#160;Populations are declining widely in Europe (Šálek <em>et al</em>. 2013), perhaps in part reflecting wide declines in susliks&#160;<em>Spermophilus</em>: these&#160;are&#160;important prey&#160;there, but are themselves decreasing widely. It is likely that localised declines occur elsewhere through rodent and pika extermination campaigns.&#160;In Russia it is commonly hunted for fur. It is losing&#160;habitat&#160;in parts of&#160;China, Russia and central Asia&#160;with conversion of&#160;steppe&#160;lands to agriculture.

Population densities of <em>M. eversmanii</em>&#160;in Mongolia and northern Kazakhstan are similar (V.V. Kolesnikov per D.

A number of historical indications further south in China and one from&#160;Kashmir, India,&#160;lack precise localities; a single recent record from the upper Mustang, Nepal, is far south of any previous known location in the eastern part of the species's range (Pocock 1941,&#160;Chetri <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).

However, this does not exclude that the species might be at risk in the southern portion of its range. Given the high relative proportion of its total range that is shared with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, it is conceivable that it could be declining fast enough over enough of its range to qualify for Near Threatened or even Vulnerable, but there is no even weak evidence to suggest this. When the geographic and ecological distribution of Small-toothed Ferret Badger in South-east Asia is clarified, it warrants a review of conservation status given that hunting and habitat encroachment are both widespread and locally heavy.","The habitat use of&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;in&#160;South-east Asia&#160;is unclear (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Some certainly located records in Viet Nam and Lao PDR are from within little-degraded evergreen forest (Roberton 2007, Robichaud 2010, Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014) but at least in Viet Nam ferret badgers of one or more species occur widely in degraded habitats as well. Given the use of farmland landscapes (with woodland copses) in China (e.g., Wang and Fuller 2003), such anthropogenic landscapes might be used in South-east Asia as well. In China it is also occupies broad-leaved forest (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;is fossorial and lives in pre-existing holes (including rodent dens, firewood stacks, open fields, and rock piles around houses (Wang and Fuller 2003), rather than digging new ones (Taylor 1989). It is largely nocturnal (Wang and Fuller 2003) and feeds primarily on small animals such as insects, earthworms (Qian <em>et al.</em> 1976, Chuang and Lee 1997), snails, frogs, and sometimes carcases of small birds and mammals, eggs, and fruit (Chian and Sheng 1976, Long and Killingley 1983, Ewer 1985, Neal 1986, Chuang 1994). Resting home range size was found to be 10.6 ha (Wang and Fuller 2003).<br/><br/>Almost all pregnant females were found between March and October during a study on the reproduction of this species on Taiwan (Pei and Wang 1995). Litter size is two, and evidence suggests that it breeds&#160;once a year (Pei and Wang 1995). This species is often found near human habitations (Storz and Wozencraft 1999), taking shelter during the day, and earthworms (the most important part of its diet) are most abundant in the fertile vegetable gardens and farmland soils where this species frequently forages (Wang and Fuller 2003).  It is also sometimes invited into native huts to exterminate cockroaches and other insects (Storz and Wozencraft 1999).","In North-east India the genus is hunted for food (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2007) and this is true across most or all of its range. In southern China this species has historically been one of the most important furbearers and is subjected to heavy harvest pressure (Shou 1962, Sheng 1993, Storz and Wozencraft 1999) and declines have occurred because of this (Lau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). However, even in southern China the genus, apparently mostly this species, remains common and widespread&#160;(Lau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In the northern part of its range, in central China, because this species is perceived neither to prey on livestock, nor cause to damage to property or farm facilities, it is not persecuted, despite its close proximity to people (Wang and Fuller 2003). In addition, the value of an individual pelt is not high, although the meat is eaten in some areas (Wang and Fuller 2003). Also in the Chinese part of its range there seems to be little threat from habitat change, given the species's occurrence in highly anthropogenic environments. Understanding threats further south in its range, where it is or might be sympatric with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, is forestalled by the difficulties of identification to species. Ferret badgers of one or more species are among the most widely camera-trapped small carnivores in Viet Nam, including in very heavily hunted areas where most species are now rare (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); perhaps the species is as resilient in South-east Asia as it is further north.","Small-toothed Ferret Badger in general seems to be relatively common, although this can only be confirmed in areas where it does not overlap with <em>M. personata</em>; this comprises, so far as is known, only a large area of China (including Taiwan). Where it does or might overlap, there are too few properly identified records in the area of sympatry to indicate relative abundance of the two species (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). ""Though widely hunted, this resilient species is probably still widespread and relatively&#160;common in many parts of South China"" (Lau <em>et al</em>&#160;2010: 263). There were 238 records of this species from Taiwan between 1991 and 1993 (Pei and Wang 1995). This species is still common on Taiwan although some other carnivores on Taiwan have decreased through widespread deterioration of natural habitat and possibly also intensive rodent control programmes during the past few decades (Wang 1986, Pei and Wang 1995). ""It is a poorly understood species, despite the fact that it seems quite common"" (Wang and Fuller 2003).During a survey on ecology in the village&#160;of Taohong,&#160;northern Jiangxi Province,&#160;southeastern China (about 15 km south of the Yangtze River, at 29º48'N, 116º40'E), 27 records of this species were reported during an 11 month period by Wang and Fuller (2003). Despite the annual average harvest of 40 individuals in an area of about 16 km², which included the study area of Wang and Fuller (2003), this species still seemed rather abundant (Wang and Fuller 2003).",Stable,"Small-toothed Ferret Badger is found in China (central and south-eastern mainland, Hainan and Hong Kong),&#160;Taiwan province of China, North-east India (e.g., Naga Hills), northern Myanmar, North and Central Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (Pocock 1941, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010, Robichaud 2010, Choudhury 2013, Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014). Occurrence in a large area of Thailand was mapped by&#160;Storz and Wozencraft (1999), but Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) could trace no record from the country. A major southward extension of known range in Viet Nam (Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014)&#160;suggests that elsewhere in South-eat Asia, potentially including Thailand, it could also occur many degrees of latitude further south than is conventionally assumed. It is also&#160;likely to occur in southern Bhutan, because there is a record from Buxa Tiger Reserve just south of that country (Choudhury 2013) and there are ferret badger records unidentified to species from the country (e.g., Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the wide region of sympatry with Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;<em>M. personata</em>&#160;(Myanmar, Lao PDR, Viet Nam,&#160;India, southern China, and&#160;potentially Thailand,&#160;Cambodia, and much of its mainland Chinese range), the continued rarity of use of reliable characters to identify records of ferret badgers to species (most recent potential records lack skulls or did not have the skull characters checked and were not preserved) hinder advances in understanding this species’s current distribution, status or ecology in these regions. It appears that, at least in eastern China, identification by examination of only the teeth may also be misleading (Stefen and Feiler 2004). Pelage characters are, so far as is presently known, unreliable in species-level identification (e.g., Choudhury 2013) so field records, including skin specimens lacking an associated skull, need to be considered as identifiable only to genus. Examination of the baculum in males also allows conclusive identification&#160;(Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014)&#160;as, presumably, would genetics.<br/><br/>Most past statements about its altitudinal range are or may be based on identifications from pelage pattern, and thus potentially include&#160;some records of&#160;Large-toothed&#160;Ferret Badger.&#160;There are specimen-validated records&#160;from up to at least&#160;1,500 m (Pocock 1941).

They live in a variety of habitats, such as woods, plains, and desert areas, but prefer open or forest-edge zones (Walker 1964). Striped Skunks are most abundant on agricultural lands where there is an ample supply of food and cover (Hamilton and Whitaker 1979). They also adapt to life in urban areas under houses and garages (Rue 1981, Rosatte 1986, Larivière <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). They have been known to inhabit poorly drained marsh areas (Mutch 1977). Although recorded up to 4,200 m, skunks usually are found from sea level to 1,800 m (Rue 1981). They are frequently found in suburban areas. Striped skunks are opportunistic omnivorous predatory feeders (Carr 1974). Their diet varies depending on season and geographic location. In most areas, they feed extensively on insects (usually grasshoppers and beetles) associated with grassland areas (as opposed to forests). However, when insects are not available (early spring, late fall), their diet shifts to small mammals, birds, or vegetation (Verts 1967).","<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>&#160;is vulnerable to a variety of mortality agents such as predation, disease, environmental conditions (e.g., severe winter or drought), chemicals, and anthropogenic activities (Rosatte and Larivière 2003, Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004,&#160;Gehrt 2005). Another limiting factor on skunk populations is&#160;diseases such as rabies and the resultant control programmes (Sikes 1970). Terrestrial rabies apparently was the case for skunks in Illinois, where population fluctuations are closely tied to rabies outbreaks (Verts 1967). Striped&#160;Skunk pelts were considered valuable commodities in the fur trade in the first half of the 20th century, but their value and the number of skunks harvested for fur declined dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s as fashions shifted away from long-haired furs (Verts 1967). Striped&#160;Skunks may be harvested in most areas of the United States and Canada. In some states, such as Florida, skunks may be taken only in season, but most states allow harvests year-round (Rosatte 1987).","Density estimates for Striped Skunk populations range from 0.7 to 18.5/km²&#160;but most are 1.8 to 4.8/km²&#160;(Bennitt and Nagel 1937,&#160;Jones 1939,&#160;Allen and Shapton 1942,&#160;Burt 1946, Verts 1967,&#160;Bailey 1971, Stout and Sonenshine 1974). Density levels reported fluctuated widely between years, possibly in response to outbreaks of diseases (Allen and Shapton 1942, Brown and Yeager 1943, Verts 1967). Skunk populations seemingly have high recruitment and turnover rates because 50 to 71% of Striped Skunks do not attain an age of 1 year (Verts 1967,&#160;Bailey 1971, Casey and Webster 1975). Because of removal of top predators (Soulé <em>et al</em>.&#160;1988, Rogers and Caro 1998,&#160;Crooks and Soulé 1999), altered land use (Oehler and Litvaitis 1996, Donovan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Dijak and Thompson 2000), reduced harvest of skunks (Hamilton and Vangilder 1992), and perhaps other factors, populations of <em>M. mephitis</em>&#160;have increased in many regions during recent years (Andren 1995, Kuehl and Clark 2002).",Stable,"The species occurs throughout most of southern Canada from British Columbia, Hudson Bay, and Nova Scotia, throughout the United States and into northern Mexico (Walker 1964, Godin 1982, Honacki <em>et al.</em>&#160;1982).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Given the ecological and economic importance of this species, there is a need for a better understanding of microhabitat factors that are associated with its&#160;occurrence (Baldwin <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The cessation of harvest in the later 20th century means that quantification of the subsequent decline rates is not possible, but these are assumed to have continued at a rate resembling those during the mid 20th century - observed and estimated to be at least 30% over the last three generations (13-14 years) and which are considered likely to continue for the next three generations.&#160;Further, multi-decadal trends in the number of individuals captured purposely or incidentally by fur trappers suggest the population is in broad decline across many portions of its range (Wires and Baker 1994, Landholdt and Genoways 2000, Gompper and Hackett 2005, Sasse and Gompper 2006, Nilz and Finck 2008, Leberg and Davis 2012).","The three subspecies of Eastern Spotted Skunk occur in separate physiographic regions and their habitat preferences vary accordingly, with a consistent theme being the need for dense cover.&#160; The most well studied subspecies is&#160;Midwestern&#160;<em>Spilogale p. interrupta</em>, for which a radio-tracking study revealed that it selected forested areas with dense understorey (Lesmeister <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; Survivorship analyses further revealed that a majority of moralities occurred when the subspecies entered or occupied more open forest habitats (Lesmeister <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/> Based on historical records and ongoing research, the subspecies known as the Appalachian Eastern&#160;Spotted&#160;Skunk (<em>S. p. putorius</em>) is primarily found in higher elevation forested habitats in the Appalachian region. Historical records of <em>S. p. putorius</em> extend down into the piedmont and coastal plain of Virginia and the Carolinas. However, no detections have been made in those regions for at least the past 30 years.&#160;Because of&#160;a general lack of structured monitoring, it is still unclear if <em>S. p. putorius</em> is rare or just cryptic within the mountains of Appalachia.&#160;However, limited evidences suggest that, similar to <em>S. p. interrupta</em>, it prefers&#160;forested habitats with dense understorey (Reed and Kennedy 2000) with many of the most dense and frequent sightings occurring at high elevation (Diggins <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160; <br/><br/>The Florida race (<em>S. p. abarvalis</em>) is the least studied, but most frequently encountered, subspecies.&#160; Multiple anecdotal reports suggest that in contrast to the other subspecies, <em>S. p. abarvalis</em> is often encountered in and near human habitation, making dens in backyards and human structures.&#160; Observations in more rural areas suggest a strong association with Gopher Tortoise <em>Gopherus polyphemus</em>&#160;burrows (Frank and Lips 1989).<br/><br/> All three subspecies are known to be fairly opportunistic omnivores.&#160;Although the only intensive studies of feeding habits are from decades ago and from agricultural settings (Selko 1936, Crabb 1941), it is generally reported that the&#160;species is&#160;primarily insectivorous, and when insects are unavailable, it preys&#160;on small mammals or birds (Boppel and Long 1994, Kinlaw 1995). However, no detailed diet studies have been conducted in forested habitats.&#160;The species is primarily nocturnal and produces&#160;one litter per year, typically in the late spring or early summer (Kinlaw 1995).","<p>While each subspecies varies somewhat in specific suite of threats, a number of patterns have emerged that require further investigation. First, while Eastern Spotted Skunk is currently reported as infrequent, incidental captures by fur trappers and the historical overharvest could have contributed to population declines (Gompper and Hackett 2005). Second, the timing of declines in the mid 20th century coincides with the first wide-scale use of synthetic pesticides, suggesting a possible link between synthetic pesticide use and spotted skunk declines. Third, landscape change associated with modern row-crop agriculture, mesophitication of eastern forests, or other large-scale habitat alterations have negatively affected the availability of early successional forest habitat and shrub cover prefered by the species. Interestingly, this has been most recently been observed in attempts to conserve Red-cockaded Woodpecker <em>Leuconotopicus borealis</em>, where pine stands managed with an open understorey for conservation of the endangered woodpecker conflict with management strategies for this skunk, which requires dense understory (Lesmeister <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fourth, predator communities have similarly changed over the past century, potentially leading to altered competition dynamics. Fifth, a number of diseases could be linked to spotted skunk decline, including parvoviruses, distemper virus, and rabies (Gompper in revision). Overall, it is likely that simultaneously several of these threats influenced, and continue to influence, Eastern Spotted Skunk&#160;populations, and that threats could differ somewhat between subspecies. Further research is urgently needed in this area to explain the species's decline and its current distribution.</p>","<p>This species is widely distributed and was once common and harvested for pelts in many areas. Harvest data are available for many US states, and these data reveal large geographic variation in the numbers of individuals harvested within any given year in the mid 1900s as well as massive declines in the numbers harvested over time (Gompper and Hackett 2005, Sasse and Gompper 2006). These declines are not attributable to decline in the number of trappers attempting to harvest furbearers. For instance, harvested animals declined from between 30,000 and 90,000 per year in Iowa between the 1920s and mid 1940s, to fewer than 100 per year when harvest of the species ended in the 1970s. Similar patterns are noted elsewhere; across the Great Plains, and beginning in about 1940, harvests dramatically declined, such that by the early 1950s total harvests in all states were below 10% of pre-crash harvest, and by the 1980s harvests were below 1% of those during pre-decline. In northern, southern and eastern states, the historical harvest was lower, but similar patterns of population declines are observed (Gompper and Hackett 2005, Sasse and Gompper 2006). The species is now considered very rare or even absent from several states within its&#160;historical range (e.g., Minnesota DNR, n.d.).<br/><br/>Few reports of population density for <em>Spilogale putorius</em> are available. Crabb (1948) calculated estimates in an agricultural area of Iowa of between one per 11.4 ha and one per 5.0 ha, depending on the method of calculation. The work in Iowa occurred when the species was still common in the state (it is now almost absent). Data collected in 1973–1974 on a barrier island in Canaveral National Seashore, Florida, revealed an extremely high density of 40/km² (Kinlaw <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>",Decreasing,"The Eastern Spotted Skunk <em>Spilogale putorius</em>&#160;is found from as far north as Minnesota, USA (and marginally into southeastern Manitoba and southwestern Ontario, Canada) to as far south as Tamaulipas, Mexico. In the eastern portion of its range it occurs in south-central Pennsylvania, USA, and south in the Appalachian Mountain chain to Florida, USA, and its western historical range extends to eastern Colorado and Wyoming, USA (Hall 1981, Kinlaw 1995). The geographic limits of its range are poorly described. Range expansion is reported to have occurred in the western USA during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and has been attributed to anthropogenic landscape change which facilitated population expansion in states such as Iowa, South Dakota, and Colorado (van Gelder 1959, Choate <em>et al.</em> 1974).",This species is widely distributed and was once common and harvested for pelts in many regions.,Terrestrial,"Based on historical trapping records, a range-wide decline of at least&#160;&gt;90%&#160;&#160;is likely to have occurred since the 1950s (Gompper and Hackett 2005).

Most states throughout the range of the species now list it as either 'endangered', 'threatened', or a species of 'conservation concern'.<br/><br/> Overall, given the lack of knowledge regarding primary threats (see Threats) and causes of decline, research is urgently needed to guide conservation action. Fortunately, researchers from multiple states and universities currently have ongoing research projects on the species, and in 2015 the Eastern Spotted Skunk Cooperative Study Group was formed to help inform managers of research priorities and potential conservation actions.<p> <br/> </p>  <p> <br/> </p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

45212861,41648,Martes americana,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern because it has a wide distribution range and is present in numerous protected areas. It may be undergoing to some localised declines through hunting and habitat loss (because of&#160;clear-cutting), but reintroduction programmes have contributed to a moderate comeback in some areas. Adequate population data are unavailable for much of the range, but the total population size is at least several hundred thousand individuals.","The species is typically associated with late-seral coniferous forests characterised by closed canopies, large trees, and&#160;abundant standing and fallen woody material (Buskirk and Powell 1994, Thompson and Harestad 1994). It dens in hollow trees or logs, in rocky crevices, or in burrows. It is primarily nocturnal. Whilst&#160;partly arboreal, it spends considerable time on the ground. The diet consists mostly of rodents and other small mammals and also includes birds, insects, fruit and carrion (Nowak 2005). Average home-range size throughout North America is 8.1 km²&#160;for males and 2.3 km²&#160;for females, and the degree of overlap varies (Powell 1994).","The species still occurs throughout most of its range, but because of loss of habitat, it has been extirpated from many south-eastern areas (Peterson 1966,&#160;Godin 1977). Marten distribution and demographic rates are affected by the loss of closed-canopy forest to logging (Thompson 1991,&#160;Bissonette <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Chapin <em>et al</em>. 1998, Payer and Harrison 2003). Martens are still legally trapped for their fur in most of the western states (Zielinski <em>et al</em>. 2001). By the early twentieth century excessive trapping had severely depleted <em>M. americana</em> in Alaska, Canada and the western conterminous United States. The range of this species has declined (Reid 2006).","The total population size is unknown but probably is at least several hundred thousand; for example, the harvest in North America in the 1983-1984 trapping season was nearly 190,000 (Novak <em>et al</em>. 1987). The Newfoundland population was estimated at fewer than 500 in early the 1990s, down from 630-875 in the early 1980s (Snyder 1986). <br/><br/>Although the&#160;species's&#160;continental range may have declined (Gibilisco 1994), it remains well distributed within its geographic range (Zielinski <em>et al</em>.&#160;2001). Adequate population data are unavailable for much of the range. Population density was found to vary from about 0.5/km²&#160;to 1.7/km²&#160;of good habitats (Banfield 1974). Reintroduction projects in northern Michigan and Wisconsin have, apparently, restored&#160;a self-sustaining population&#160;in that region (Slough 1994). Reintroduction also has been attempted in New Hampshire and in various other parts of the north-western United States and south-western Canada (Nowak 2005).",Decreasing,"American Marten occurs&#160;across most of North America from Alaska through much of forested Canada, into the north-eastern United States, and south along northern California, south in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains.","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"In most state and provincial jurisdictions in western North America where it occurs, the American Marten is managed as a furbearer. Protective regulations allowed the species to make a comeback in some areas, but in the eastern United States it survives only in small parts of Minnesota, New York and Maine (Yocum, 1974,&#160;Mech and Rogers 1977). In the Pacific states, conservation measures should include a re-evaluation of timber harvest plans that affect habitat in coastal forests, inter-agency cooperation on a coastal marten conservation assessment, and the collection of new survey information, especially on private lands in south-western Washington and north-western Oregon (Zielinski <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
45212973,41649,Martes flavigula,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Yellow-throated Marten is listed as Least Concern because of its wide geographic and habitat distribution, evidently large population, occurrence in many protected areas, presence in many heavily degraded areas and, the lack of identified major threats. In certain islands of its range (perhaps Taiwan, less likely Java), the island-endemic subspecies might be threatened.","With its huge range from boreal to equatorial areas and sea-level to over 4,000 m a.s.l., Yellow-throated Marten occupies a concomitantly wide range of habitats. In the Russian Far East it prefers mixed (coniferous&#160;and broad-leaved) forests of the Manchurian type, while it occurs rarely in the dark coniferous taiga of the upper mountain zone and in the oak forests zone (Matyushkin 1993); it occurs in areas even with deep prolonged winter snow-cover and is active right through the winter (Kerley and Borisenko 2014). In Nepal and Pakistan it inhabits montane forests up to the tree line (V. Dinets pers. comm. 2015). In Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand it is found in forests and various other adjacent habitats across a wide altitudinal range (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong<em> et al</em>.&#160;2014). It was recorded in secondary forest, that was logged in the 1970s, and which surrounds a palm estate, in Malaysia in 2000-2001 by Azlan (2003) and at least in South-east Asia, there are many records from heavily degraded areas and a small number of records from a palm oil plantation in Sabah (A.J. Hearn and J. Ross&#160;pers.&#160;comm. 2014); there is insufficient information to determine whether such areas are permanently occupied, let alone capable of supporting populations in isolation from native forest.&#160;.<br/><br/>Although sometimes said to be largely or entirely nocturnal, the species is primarily diurnal; nocturnal activity&#160;increases&#160;during moonlit nights (within a few days of full moon) (Duckworth 1997, Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005, Parr and Duckworth 2007, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Common food items include squirrels, birds, snakes, and lizards, although its wide diet includes also insects, eggs, frogs, kitchen waste, fruit, and nectar (e.g., Nandini and Karthik 2007, Parr and Duckworth 2007). Ungulates are eaten, in some areas as a large proportion of the diet; the proportion predated versus scavenged, especially in tropical areas, is not clear (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2014 and references therein). In nature, foraging groups of two to three or, more rarely, five to seven, individuals are typical (e.g., Parr and Duckworth, 2007); in the Russian Far East the species hunts in groups for&#160;Siberian&#160;Musk-deer <em>Moschu</em><em>s mo</em><em>schiferu</em><em>s</em> (Matyushkin 1993). Hunting in duos was common&#160;in Nepal and Pakistan, as revealed by&#160;both direct observations&#160;and by snow tracking (V. Dinets pers. comm. 2015). These groups can move through the habitat separated by 100 m or more and it is likely that many assumptions of solo hunting relate to observations where additional animals were overlooked (J.W. Duckworth per. comm. 2014).&#160;It is often assumed to be largely arboreal, but the regularity with which it is camera-trapped at ground level across its range belies this. There seems to be no study that has quantified activity by height in the vegetation column, but in tropical Asia only a handful of J.W. Duckworth's&#160;(pers. comm. 2014) several dozen direct sightings were of animals more than a few feet above ground level.<br/><br/>Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) found that, in Phu Kieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand,&#160;this species has a mean annual range size of 7.2 km² with a mean overlap of 34%. The litter size is up to five, and the gestation period is 220-290 days; it has life span of up to 14 years (Lekagul and McNeely 1977).","Yellow-throated Marten seems to be tied to forest areas, at least in the South-east Asian parts of its range. Therefore, forest conversion there over the last few decades will have resulted in some overall population reduction. However, for a species that is common in hill evergreen forest and tolerant of degradation, very large areas remain and are likely to do so for the foreseeable future. These declines thus do not constitute a threat to the species. Moreover, the species is surviving well within remaining forests (including secondary stands), for two likely reasons: (i) it is little sought as food or for any other reason by most residents, and (ii) its scansorial nature reduces its exposure to snares and other traps, as well as allowing easy escape from domestic and feral&#160;dogs. Therefore, no significant threats at the population level are known to the species in South-east Asia, although it is no doubt below carrying capacity in heavily hunted areas such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam. It is occasionally hunted in Siberia (Russia) and DPR Korea for its fur (A. Abramov pers. comm. 2006, J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006) but this does not constitute a global threat, rather it affects local populations at most. It can habituate to the close approach of many people and take food from human waste (Parr and Duckworth 2007).","Few population assessments of Yellow-throated Marten exist. In Sikhote-Alinsky Nature Reserve (Russian Far East) the population density was estimated to be 1-5 per 100&#160;km²&#160;(Matyushkin 1993). The total population in Russia is estimated as 2,500-3,500 individuals (A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2006). It is evidently common across Lao PDR (Duckworth 1997), Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), Viet Nam (Dang Ngoc Can <em>et al</em>. 2008)&#160;and Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008) and probably widely elsewhere in its tropical range (references in Parr and Duckworth 2007). It is also common in montane forests in Nepal and Pakistan (V. Dinets pers. comm. 2015). It has been considered rare in Java and Taiwan; while more recent information indicates it is regularly seen in the former, including in degraded areas (J. A. Eaton pers. comm. 2013), camera-trapping suggests it is indeed scarce in Taiwan (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009). Population trend has not been quantified anywhere in its range, but the wide persistence in the heavily hunted countries of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, including close to long-standing settlements in highly degraded habitat (Duckworth 1997, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014), suggests that it is quite resilient to widespread potential pressures of forest degradation and fragmentation, and to intensive non-selective ground-based traps. It is hence unlikely to be declining much more than the background rate of deforestation.",Decreasing,"Yellow-throated Marten occurs in South, South-east and East Asia, from Afghanistan and Pakistan in the west, along the Himalaya and foothills east to southern China, throughout mainland South-east Asia, and the islands of Sumatra, Java and Borneo, It also&#160;extends north through eastern China (including&#160;Taiwan) and Korea to the Russian Far East (Corbet and Hill 1992, Matyushkin&#160;1993; Wang and Xie 2004, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2011, Kerley and Borisenko 2014). There is one old specimen labelled 'Singapore' (Meiri 2005), but no other suggestion of occurrence there (M.A.H. Chua pers. comm. 2014). In Bangladesh it occurs in the North-east and South-east (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). Statements of occurrence in southern India refer to the taxon <em>gwatkinsii</em>, here considered a full species, but widely treated as a race of Yellow-throated Marten until recently.<br/>&#160;<br/>The species's known elevational range extends from sea-level to 4,510 m (Duckworth 1995, Appel and Khatiwada 2014).","At least in the tropical parts of its range, there is little evidence of any targeted harvest of this species. However, in much of its range, notably northern South-east Asia, much hunting uses non-selective traps (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014),&#160;and the species is caught in those as part of the general take. Elsewhere, there is some targeted hunting: in Pakistan and Afghanistan the species is reportedly hunted for its fur, with Nuristan apparently the main source of furs of this species in Kabul’s markets (Stevens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).",Terrestrial,"Yellow-throated Marten is protected in many parts of its range. This species is protected in Myanmar&#160;under the Wildlife Act of 1994 (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008), in Thailand under WARPA 2003 (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) and in Peninsular Malaysia under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (Azlan 2003). This species is listed on CITES Appendix III (India) and Category II of the China Wildlife Protection Law (1988) (Li <em>et al.</em> 2000). This species is listed as Near Threatened on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004). This species is known from many protected areas across its range. With no identified threats, attention to the integrity of the protected areas network is likely to be sufficient to ensure its survival across its range. This does not rule out that populations in specific parts of it range might be threatened.

In most its range it is no danger of decreasing numbers, notwithstanding declines in&#160;some countries comprising in total only a&#160;small proportion of its range.","The Sable inhabits serried coniferous (taiga) and deciduous forests, in both plains and mountains. It has been observed near megacities in areas with developed industry (Sinitsyn 2012). In forest, individual home range is 4-30 km² (Heptner&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1967). Adults have areas 2-3 times larger than do the young. If food availability is low, the home range is larger. In autumn young animals are leaving denning sites (Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1967, Bakeyev and Sinitsyn 1994) and tend towards&#160;floodplains (Monakhov 2001). Average movement rate is 7.3-10.6 km per day for males and 6.5-12.0 km per day for females (Gusev 1966). Most tagged Sables went no farther than 30 km from the tagging sites (Monakhov and Timofeev 1965, Sutula and Popov 2001, Chernikin 2006), with the maximum recorded distance for males (females not observed) with ear labels was up to 300 km (Bakeyev <em>et al</em>. 1980, Bakeyev and Sinitsyn 1994, Chernikin 2006). Sometimes Sables are caught 130-160 km outside the species's range (Monakhov 2010).<br/><br/>The Sable lives mainly in the lower (ground) storey of the forest, in contrast to Pine Marten <em>Martes&#160;martes</em>, which is more arboreal (Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1967).<br/><br/>The Sable is an omnivorous predator (Timofeev and Nadeev 1955, Heptner&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1967, Monakhov and Bakeyev 1981, Bakeyev&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Its winter diet (during the hunting period) is studied better. In the Sayan and Ural&#160;Mountains, stomach and faeces samples contain 64-80% mammals (mostly small), 6-12% birds, 33-77% of pine nuts <em>Pinus sibirica</em> and <em>P. pumila</em>, and 4-33% berries. Similar proportions were observed for lowland taiga in West Siberia: 75-90%, 24-80%, 20-53% and 20-63%, respectively (Monakhov and Bakeyev 1981). Prey may also include larger mammals: pika <em>Ochotona</em>, squirrels <em>Sciurus</em> and <em>Pteromys</em>, Muskrat <em>Ondatra</em>, marmots <em>Marmota</em>, hare <em>Lepus timidus</em>, and Siberian Musk-deer <em>Moschus moschiferus</em> (Khlebnikov 1977, Zirjanov <em>et al</em>. 2001, Chernikin 2006). Cannibalism was shown by Kolychev (1976) in the Yenisei Siberia and Transbaikalia. Fish is not rarely found in the diet (Tavrovsky 1971, Monakhov and Bakeyev 1981).<br/><br/>Gestation lasts 245–298 days including 7.5–8.0 months of diapause. The duration of embryonic development after implantation (true pregnancy) is 30–35 days. Births take place from 25 March to 3 May. Litter size is 1–7 kits, with an average of 2.5–3.5. In Russia, mean number of corpora lutea differs geographically from 2.52 in the Sayan&#160;Mountains&#160;to 4.47 in Kamchatka with maximum to 4.97 in Demjanka River basin. The maximum number of corpora lutea in the wild is eight, with nine in captivity (Monakhov 2011a).<br/><br/>The average proportion of males in the population 54.5% ± 0.08% SE (n = 13,997; Monakhov and Bakeyev 1981). The age structure is very variable in the local populations. Underyearlings (juveniles) can amount to 30.5-75.6% of the population (Monakhov 2005), their average share 44.8% (Monakhov and Bakeyev 1981). Revealed shares of underyearlings are often very high, which is inconsistent with the natural growth of the population and the observed size of offspring. This discrepancy is considered the result of selective capture and shooting of young animals in the hunting (Monakhov and Bakeyev 1981; Monakhov 1983, 2005, 2012b).<br/><br/>The age structure, determined by the Klevezal and Kleinenberg (1969) method of aging, is as follows: juveniles 62.7%; yearlings 12.5%; 2–4 year-olds 2.7–5.5%; 5–7 year-olds 1.5–3.7%, and animals&#160;of 8 years and older 0.4–1.7% in the Urals (n = 2,150), and 75.6%, 5.7%, 2.7–4.9%, 0.8–2.5% and 0.2–1.4%, respectively, in the Western Sayan (n = 1,765 - Monakhov 2005). Annual survival rates of Sable: 19.9% for underyearlings, 44.0% for yearlings, and 75.9–79.4% of animals 2–9 years in the Urals (Monakhov 2005) and 33.0%, 59.6% and 49.3–75.8%, respectively, in the Western Sayan (Sokolov 1979).<br/><br/>In addition to natural deaths&#160;(together with zoonoses), the enemies of&#160;Sable are eight species of mammal and eight species of bird (Monakhov 2011a). The competitors of&#160;Sable are omnivorous and carnivorous predators. Up to 34 helminth species, 19 species of fleas and three species of gamasid mites are described as&#160;Sable parasites (Bakeyev <em>et al</em>. 2003).","The main factor in reducing the number is winter hunting. However in Russia,&#160;Sable&#160;is&#160;exploited in compliance with scientifically substantiated quotas,&#160;so this hunting is not a threat to the&#160;species.&#160;Some habitat is lost&#160;through clear-felling of forests, building of communications, and the development of new mines, oil and gas fields.","Recent studies (Borisov and Lomanov 2006, Safonov <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sinitsyn 2012) have shown that earlier growth in&#160;Sable numbers&#160;has continued. Leading&#160;Sable ecologists and researchers documented that&#160;Sable harvest in Russia reached 700,000 – 750,000 animals in the winter 2011/2012 game season and the Russian population is&#160;estimated at 2.0–2.2 million animals (Dejkin <em>et al</em>. 2011, Monakhov 2012a, Monakhov and Li 2013). In the 2010s&#160;Sable occupies all suitable habitats and previously not colonised territories, which allows numbers to increase in Russia. Sable numbers in China were estimated in 6,000 in the 1990s (Ma 1998) and 18,000 in the 2010s (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2011, Monakhov and Li 2013). Population of&#160;Sable in Mongolia were assessed at least 10,000 for Central Hentii Mountain Range in the 1970s (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). No estimates are available for Japan, Korea or Kazakhstan; the occupied parts&#160;of each of these countries comprise only a&#160;small part of the&#160;species's global range.",Increasing,"The Sable occurs&#160;in Eurasia, mainly in mountain and lowland conifer forests of Siberia from the European north-east (western foothills of the Urals) to the Pacific Ocean, including Kamchatka, Sakhalin and&#160;Hokkaido. In Russia, it occurs across&#160;7 million km² (Bakeyev and Sinitsyn 1994). In north-west&#160;China, it currently occurs in a small area of the southern Altai Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In&#160;north-east&#160;China, it is now found in the Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains of Heilongjiang and Inner (Nei) Mongolia provinces (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Mongolia, it inhabits the north-western Mongol Altai Mountain Range, the mountains around Lake Hovsgol, and the Hentii&#160;Mountains&#160;(Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Sable occurs in&#160;northern&#160;Korea around the Changbaishan (Paektu) Mountains and southward into North Hamgyong province, DPR Korea, but not in the south (Won and Smith 1999), although the entire Korean peninsula was&#160;indicated to hold it by Anderson (1970), Bobrinskii <em>et al</em>. (1944) and Heptner&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(1967). In the Japanese archipelago,&#160;Sable occurs only on Hokkaido. In Kazakhstan,&#160;Sable originally dwelt in the&#160;south-west&#160;Altai Mountains in Eastern province along the Uba and Buhtarma Rivers basin (Monakhov 2011a).<br/><br/>Across its range, Sable uses a wide altitudinal range, depending at any given locality on the distribution of forest vegetation. For example, in the Ob Basin it inhabits forests at altitudes of 20-200 m a.s.l.; in the Ural&#160;Mountains, at 200-650 m; in the Altai Mountains, at 350-1,100 m; in the Sayan&#160;Mountains, at 900-2,100 m; in the Barguzin and Cherskii ridges, at 600-1,600 m; and in the Verkhoyansk Ridge, it reaches 2,100-2,200 m a.s.l.","Sable is hunted heavily and, nowadays,&#160;sustainably across much of its range as a valued furbearer.",Terrestrial,"In Russia, after a critical depression in number that lasted until the 1940s,&#160;Sable is&#160;protected in&#160;state nature reserves, national parks, and game reserves.&#160;Outside protected areas,&#160;Sable harvesting in Russia is&#160;strictly regimented by hunting quotas for each region and is&#160;limited to 15 October - 29 February.&#160;The main areas where&#160;Sable is&#160;protected are 41&#160;state nature reserves with a total area of 164,960 km².

This species occurs&#160;mostly in a mountain meadows - themselves a threatened ecosystem within its range. The species's&#160;range also constitutes an area where recent climate change and predicted future change in climate could substantially reduce the habitat. These declines&#160;over the past three generations&#160;are projected to continue, through the&#160;same factors, for the next three.","Altai Weasel occurs&#160;only outside closed forest habitats, typically in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, dry&#160;steppes and&#160;plains, and river valleys with reeds and bushes&#160;(e.g., Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1967,&#160;Hornskov and Foggin 2007,&#160;Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). It is also found in sparse forest vegetation and predominantly open landscape (Kruska 1990). It often occurs close to human settlements and agriculture (e.g,.&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). It is exclusively carnivorous, preying mainly upon&#160;pikas <em>Ochotona</em>, various rodents&#160;(voles, mice, hamsters), small birds, lizards, and insects (Pocock 1941).

Most seriously there are agriculturally-driven pika <em>Ochotona</em>-control campaigns across much of this&#160;species's range, which have eradicated the weasel's main food from large areas (Hornskov and Foggin 2007). It is affected by 'mountain meadow' degradation, of the habitats to which it is particularly adapted: on the Tibetan plateau,&#160;Hornskov and Foggin (2007) observed that&#160;""in most places the natural vegetation cover has been partially to seriously overgrazed by domestic bovids (yak and yak/cow hybrids) and sheep: only a few areas remain with little or no human/livestock impact on the grassland vegetation"". This species does not tolerate a high degree of alteration and it avoids agricultural lands. In Nepal it is killed for use as a medicinal charm but given its ongoing common occurrence close to human settlements, this does not seem to be at levels sufficient to threaten it (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Widely elsewhere in its&#160;range it is occasionally hunted, perhaps mostly for fur,&#160;but probably not at levels to drive population declines.","The species is common but not abundant throughout its range (e.g., Hornskov and Foggin 2007). Population density fluctuates depending on prey abundance by 4 or 5 times.",Decreasing,"Altai Weasel is found in central and east Asia, with a range comprising China; Pakistan; the Himalaya in&#160;India (Kashmir eastward to Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal and Bhutan; eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia and parts of Russia (southern and south-eastern Siberia, Primorski Krai) (Wang 2003, Wozencraft 2005, Choudhury 2013, Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Ladakh, India, is&#160;often omitted from the range but it is found there regularly&#160;(Ben-Yehuda in prep.). The proximity of some records in Pakistan to Afghanistan (Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014)&#160;suggests that it will also be found to occur in&#160;Afghanistan.&#160;It has been said to inhabit DPR Korea (Wozencraft 2005) but this appears to be&#160;based on a prediction, albeit a plausible one given the proximity of&#160;some records in China to Korea&#160;(Won and&#160;Smith 1999).&#160;<br/><br/>This species's&#160;altitudinal use varies across its range.

On the Tibetan plateau, Hornskov and Foggin (2007) observed it over 2,300-4,700 m. Further north, it occurs down to the lowlands:&#160;in Kazakhstan it occurs from plain river valleys (340 m) up to 3,000 m in mountains of Dzhungar Alatau (Sludsky <em>et al</em>. 1982), whereas&#160;records from Russian Far East (the plains near Lake&#160;Khanka) are at elevations&#160;of about 80-100 m (A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2014).","In Nepal, and perhaps elsewhere in its range, mummified bodies are hung in houses as a perceived way of reducing the threat of death to newborn human babies (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). This use is projected to decline with increasing access to modern medicine. During 1930-1970, it was actively hunted for fur in the eastern part Kazakhstan (mainly in the valley of the River&#160;Ili&#160;and near&#160;Lake&#160;Balkhash). More than 23,000 &#160;were trapped here in 1933 (Sludsky <em>et al</em>. 1982).

This species is tolerant to a moderate amount of land-use change and can often benefit from human presence. However, <em>M. frenata</em> populations generally fluctuate, and they frequently become locally extinct in response to changes in prey numbers (King 1989).","Found in a wide variety of habitats, usually near water. Favoured habitats include brushland and open woodlands, field edges, riparian grasslands, swamps, and marshes (Sheffield, in Wilson and Ruff 1999). Dens are in abandoned burrows&#160;made by other mammal, rock crevices, brushpiles, stump hollows, or spaces&#160;amongst&#160;tree roots; one individual may use multiple dens. Tolerant of close proximity to humans. <br/><br/><em>M. frenata</em> is usually most abundant in late seral stages or ecotones where prey diversity is greatest (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Its diet consists mainly of rodents and other small mammals. It is primarily nocturnal but is frequently active by day. It can climb and swim, but apparently not as well as <em>M. erminea</em>. Waterways provide access to suitable habitat and are a natural avenue far dispersal, particularly in areas that otherwise are unsuitable (Fagerstone 1987). Home ranges vary from 4 to 120 ha and may overlap. Basically solitary, though more social where prey is abundant and habitat optimal.","Movements of radio-tagged Long-tailed Weasels in Indiana, U.S.A., were consistent with the notion that the species may be sensitive to agriculturally induced fragmentation of habitat, indicating the importance of maintaining landscape connectivity for this&#160;species (Gehring and Swihart 2004). Additional threats include monoculture and drainage of wetlands. Perhaps affected directly and indirectly by pesticide use (effects on reproduction, habitat, and/or food supply).","Long-tailed Weasel is widespread and fairly common throughout its&#160;range (Wilson and Ruff 1999).&#160;Estimates of densities vary widely by habitat and prey availability (King 1989), from about 1/2.6 ha to 1/260 ha (Nowak 2005).

Although forest conversion is continuing rapidly in South-east Asia, the main populations of this species are in hill forest, which has markedly lower clearance rates than do level lowland forests, In short, there is a lack of any plausible identified threat that could be driving declines at rates to qualify for listing even as&#160;Near Threatened.","Yellow-bellied Weasel in most of its range is generally associated with rugged highlands (over 1,000 m). It may occur well below 1,000 m in such areas, but it seems unlikely that the species occurs at lower elevations in areas away from high altitude terrain, except in parts of China and Viet Nam. While evidently primarily an evergreen forest species, it seems likely that it is tolerant of even quite severe habitat degradation, and it appears to persist in the face of heavy hunting (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). Its natural history has never been studied; it is evidently diurnal, probably mostly ground-dwelling but an at least occasional climber, and is assumed to be largely carnivorous (but see Wan 2014).&#160;On Hainan Island, China, where it is the only <em>Mustela</em> species, thus reducing risks of confusion, villagers report that it raids poultry&#160;regularly&#160;in villages (Bosco P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014).","As with many other forest weasels, there are no major threats known or suspected to this species. In particular, the effects of the current high levels of forest degradation within much of its range cannot be assumed to be strongly negative, given the number of records from degraded and fragmented areas. Similarly, although much of its range coincides with heavy generalised mammal hunting using non-specific techniques, there is no evidence that this (or the inevitable retaliatory killing for actual or perceived losses of small livestock such as poultry) is driving steep declines over any large proportion of its range. This does not mean that such declines might not be occurring locally; this is most likely to be so in Viet Nam, looking at patterns of ground-level snaring pressure. Even in this case, the paucity of salvage records from snare lines suggests that weasels are only rarely caught: plausibly they move through the brush-wood drift fences (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and, given that the snare-lines usually run across relatively open understorey, weasels perhaps avoid these areas anyway (D.H.A. Willcox&#160;pers. comm. 2014). It remains secure in heavily hunted parts of south China where most other carnivores are now very rare (Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).","Recent camera-trap records suggest that Yellow-bellied Weasel is fairly common in forested areas in southern China (Lau <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2010), where few other small carnivores survive in meaningful numbers. However, in general it seems difficult to camera-trap (e.g., Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Supparatvikorn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM3) and this hinders assessment of its population status. Despite the rather low density of records across most of its range, there is no reason to assume that this species is rare,&#160;and its persistence in various highly degraded and/or heavily hunted areas suggests its population is unlikely to be in decline (e.g., Duckworth and Robichaud, 2005,&#160;Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2010).",Stable,"Yellow-bellied Weasel is found along parts of the Indian Himalaya through Nepal, Bhutan, North-east India and&#160;southern China&#160;east to Hong Kong, and in South-east Asia in northern and central Myanmar,&#160;northern and central Thailand, Lao PDR and Viet Nam, with one series&#160;of records in the Cardamom mountains of Cambodia (Pocock 1941, Duckworth and Robichaud 2005, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Pei <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ghimirey and Acharya 2012, Supparatvikorn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Abramov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Choudhury 2013,&#160;Phan <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;The southernmost record is from the Dalat Plateau, Viet Nam (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2013). Historically, this species was much overlooked in South-east Asia, with no records from Thailand at all, and the few from Viet Nam all coming from the northern highlands. Its full southern extent is perhaps still not determined (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005). As of late 2014, there are no records from Bangladesh (Hasan Rahman pers comm. 2014), although it seems likely to occur in the evergreen forests of the north-east.<br/><br/>There is wide variation in altitudinal use over Yellow-bellied Weasel's range. In Hong Kong, it is found from close to sea-level to over 200 m (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006). In China, it has been recorded at 150 m on Hainan Island, at 1,415 m in north-western Guangxi, to 1,900 m in north-west Yunnan (Bosco P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014) There is one record from Viet Nam at only 50 m, although most others traced by Roberton (2007) were in hills and mountains. Records from Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Myanmar are all from above 770 m, most from above 1,000 m (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Supparatvikorn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Phan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and given patterns of survey effort, it is safe to conclude that it does not typically inhabit the lowlands of South-east Asia west of the Annamite Mountains. In India it occurs mostly at 1,000-4,000 m (Choudhury 2013), in Bhutan up to 3,800 m (P.

45214384,41658,Mustela putorius,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Western Polecat is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining at the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category or even as&#160;Near Threatened. The confidence of this assessment is low, given the paucity of recent precise and accurate information on population trend across most of&#160;its range. The geographic range and population (not known, but as&#160;inferred under a reasonable population density)&#160;are both well in excess of&#160;what would be required for the&#160;species to be listed as even Near Threatened on those grounds. However, the&#160;situation is less clear with population trend. As a&#160;species&#160;living largely in landscapes dominated by&#160;farming and other human endeavour, it is difficult to infer population trend from gross patterns of&#160;habitat change; changes&#160;in farming&#160;style&#160;and other human activities are likely to have much larger effects.&#160;There is&#160;evidence of recent strong decline in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany (A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015) and of decline in&#160;various other parts of western Europe&#160;(see 'Population'&#160;section) and it&#160;seems&#160;likely that the&#160;species is declining&#160;across much of this region. However, in&#160;some areas,&#160;such as&#160;Britain and&#160;Switzerland, populations which had&#160;shown heavy declines in the past are now rebounding.&#160;Europe west of the former 'Iron Curtain' accounts&#160;for only about a quarter of Western Polecat range, and in the remaining three-quarters the general opinion is of population&#160;stability. Moreover, population densities in this&#160;latter area are believed to be&#160;substantially higher than in Western Europe.&#160;If all this information is accurate,&#160;the overall global population trend&#160;seems unlikely to reach the rate of about 20% decline per 13-14 years (three generations) that would make a Near Threatened categorisation appropriate, despite the drastic&#160;situation in parts of western Europe.<br/><br/>The North African populations of disputed origin and taxonomic identity, either part of or close to this species, are poorly known but seem to be extremely rare and threatened (Gippoliti 2011, Ahmim 2013,&#160;Griffiths and Cuzin 2013); however, they comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they do not affect the Red List categorisation for the species as a whole.","Over its wide geographic range,&#160;Western&#160;Polecat is found in a wide variety of habitats (Zabala <em>et al</em>. 2005 and references therein). It occurs widely&#160;in lowland woods and in riparian zones, and in rural areas close to farms and villages in the winter; but it also uses wooded steppe, sand dunes, marshes and river valleys, agricultural land, forest edge and mosaic habitats (Birks 1999, Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). In&#160;the&#160;Russian&#160;Federation, which comprises&#160;the majority of its global range, waterside habitats are very important for the&#160;species&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;In Spain, it lives&#160;in a very wide range of environments, from Atlantic to Mediterranean habitats (Virgós&#160;2007,&#160;J. Herrero <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015) with again an association with water-edge habitats&#160;(Zabala&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). In general, mountainous areas are avoided. In the French Mediterranean region in particular, Polecat records&#160;are much less frequent than elsewhere in the country; the&#160;species' presence in this region&#160;seems linked to the presence of wetlands (S. Ruette and M. Guinot-Ghestem <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015), as has been&#160;found in&#160;Italy and Portugal (Rondinini <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mestre <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>It feeds on live lagomorphs,&#160;rodents (various genera of voles, mice and hamsters), amphibians&#160;and other vertebrates, also sometimes on invertebrates and carrion (e.g. Birks 1999). In many Mediterranean areas, it is specialised in the predation of lagomorphs, notably&#160;European&#160;Rabbit&#160;<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>&#160;(Roger 1991, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Population declines in western Europe have generally been attributed to over-hunting and to heavy loss or modification of the species' preferential habitats of wetlands and hedged farmland (e.g. Roger <em>et al</em>. 1988, Birks &amp; Kitchener 1999, Baghli and Verhagen 2003). Hunting is now likely to be less of a problem than formerly except at a local&#160;scale, whereas agrochmicals and introduced carnivores may be widespread and increasing threats (see below).<br/><br/>Wetland&#160;destruction has been identified as&#160;a cause of decline in&#160;Germany and&#160;Switzerland&#160;(A. Schreiber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015,&#160;P. Dollinger<em> pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;In areas where the Polecat is associated with wetlands, reduction of these habitats is particularly damaging in autumn and winter, during periods of lower abundance of amphibians (Weber 1989, Lodé 1991, Baghli <em>et al</em>. 2002). In France, the drying of wetlands and the increase of agricultural land more than halved the total wetland area between 1940 and 1990 (Report Claude Bernard 1994).&#160;Hedges provide adequate cover for Polecat activity in otherwise open farmland&#160;(Birks 2000). Consequently, the wide destruction of hedgerows that occurred in western Europe in the mid and late 20th century&#160;is likely to have&#160;contributed to the decline of the species. Indeed, despite a slowdown in the uprooting of hedgerows since the 1990s, hedgerow surface area declined by 5% per year in France from 1982 to 1990 (Pointereau 2002).<br/><br/>Reduced prey-base also causes&#160;some&#160;declines, particularly in Mediterranean areas where European&#160;Rabbit <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> forms a large part of the diet (see 'Habitats and ecology' section). Mediterranean Rabbit populations have been in steep decline for 25 years because of diseases, such as myxomatosis (Calvete <em>et al</em>. 1997) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) (Moreno&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Delibes-Mateos <em>et al</em>. 2009), and modification of its habitat and hunting (Calvete <em>et al</em>. 2006). The&#160;steep&#160;declines&#160;in Switzerland up to the 1970s were attributed in part to declining populations of&#160;amphibians (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Declines in other prey species, such as European Hamster&#160;<em>Cricetus cricetus</em>&#160;and even rats and mice (Muridae)&#160;probably contribute to the&#160;steep&#160;declines in parts of the range&#160;such as&#160;Saxony-Anhalt, Germany&#160;(A. Weber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Such declines&#160;are driven by intensive agriculture (high pesticide use, rapid cultivation, choice of crops and the near-complete use of land.<br/><br/>Western&#160;Polecat is vulnerable to heavy trapping. It disappeared from most of Britain because of sustained intensive trapping, as a pest of game-birds and small livestock, from the 19th century into the early decades of the 20th (Langley and Yalden 1977). However, it recolonised the country following the near-cessation of this practice (Birks and Kitchener 1999, Birks 2000) and the resurgence of Rabbit populations (Birks 2000).<br/><br/>In western Europe,&#160;Western&#160;Polecat was formerly widely hunted for sport and fur and persecuted as a pest, but these threats have become less serious. The species is now protected in a number of range states and in such areas, the rates of hunting have greatly reduced. For example, in Switzerland, in each of the years 2009, 2013 and 2014 only a&#160;single individual (male) was killed under special license. Cantons issuing the licenses were Zurich, Berne and Argovia (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm. </em>2016). In&#160;such areas, legal killing cannot be a threat. In France, Western Polecat&#160;was classified as 'pest' in half of (49) French departments in 1997, 1999 and 2001. But&#160;trapping of Polecats has progressively&#160;decreased since 1998, and has not been permitted since 2012 (Albaret <em>et al</em>. 2014), except in two areas (totalling around 3,500 km²). However, even before the ban, trapping&#160;intensity seemed limited: in 1998, catches were performed in only 8.6% (± 14%) of localities where the species could legally be trapped (Ruette&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004), and only around 6,000 catches by trapping were registered in France in 2011 (Albaret &#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). August 2012&#160;modification of the French legislation about 'pest' species meant that the Polecat could not be trapped until July 2015; subsequent legislation (July 2015 to July 2018) does not permit trapping of Polecats except in two areas. However,&#160;legal trapping for other mustelid species and non-selective predator control (see Treves and Naughton-Treves, 2005) could represent a threat for the Polecat (S. Ruette and M. Guinot-Ghestem <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In particular, trapping campaigns against the American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;have resulted in many&#160;Polecats being killed in confusion (C. Arthur<em> pers. comm.</em> 2016). Hunting Western Polecat with guns remains legally permitted in France.&#160;The 2013 national enquiry estimated that fewer than 3,000 Polecats were hunted in 2013 in France (ONCFS-FNC in press).<br/><br/>Hunting, as a perceived&#160;pest of wild game, is legal throughout the year in Austria (A. Kranz <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>By contrast with much of western Europe, in European Russia the species is still hunted. However, intentional hunting is not intensive because the price per pelt is so cheap: only 30–50%&#160;of that of American Mink and 10–20%&#160;that of martens <em>Marte</em><em>s</em>. In the area of best habitat for the&#160;species in Russia, the&#160;southern forest expanses in the European part, the polecat is hunted intentionally only occasionally, for example as&#160;a pest of domestic animals&#160;such as&#160;chickens (D.&#160;Skumatov <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). Harvest usually occurs&#160;as a 'by-catch'of hunting for&#160;American Mink&#160;and Pine Marten <em>Martes martes</em> (A. Vaisman per R. Melisch,&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2016). The species is fairly frequent by-catch in traps&#160;set for&#160;American Mink, but only rarely in the baited leghold traps&#160;set for&#160;martens, beavers <em>Ca</em><em>s</em><em>tor</em>, Red Fox&#160;<em>Vulpe</em><em>s v</em><em>ulpe</em><em>s</em>, badgers <em>Mele</em><em>s</em>, Musk Rat&#160;<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>, Eurasian Lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em> and others&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2015). In one area, the trapping of 4,000 Pine Martens resulted in only about 100 Western Polecats taken as bycatch (A. Saveljev pers. comm. 2016).&#160;Overall, trapping is not a threat to the&#160;species in Russia (A. Saveljev <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;In Morocco and Algeria,&#160;in at least some areas, the species is captured for hunting (e.g. Ahmim 2013).<br/><br/>In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, Polecats have a very high pollutant burden (PCB, PBB, PBDE, OCP and human medicine) leading to diminished reproductive output (which is particularly problematic for 'r-strategy' species such as this) (A. Weber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). There is too little comparable information from other parts of the&#160;species's range, but there is no reason not to think that similar pollutant loads will not be borne by populations elsewhere in lowland mesic&#160;western and central Europe, given patterns of human&#160;settlement and agriculture. Frogs&#160;sampled in Switzerland in the 1980s had high levels&#160;of PCBs and these pollutants were considered to have led to major declines in the country's&#160;Eurasian Otter <em>Lutra lutra</em> populations (Weber 1990);&#160;subsequently otter populations have strengthened in the country (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016); Polecat numbers have risen at the&#160;same time although the cause&#160;is not known.&#160;Secondary rodenticide poisoning (see&#160;Shore&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, 1999, 2003; Birks 1998; Fournier-Chambrillon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004; Giraudoux 2006) could potentially be an important threat, but its impact on Polecat populations remains to be evaluated extensively.<br/><br/>The introduced American Mink is likely to be a problematic, at&#160;some level,&#160;for&#160;the Polecat&#160;in the large parts of its&#160;range where this invasive species is now established. The long-term population-level consequences on the Polecat of the variety of&#160;effects of this&#160;species&#160;(see, e.g.&#160;Barrientos 2015) remain poorly understood. Three carnivore species&#160;are believed to be driving Polecat declines in Belarus: the introduced American Mink in valley ecosystems (competition for prey during raising kits, especially the decline in Water Voles <em>Arvicola amphibius</em>&#160;effected by American Mink, and interference towards vulnerable female Polecats); the introduced&#160;Raccoon Dog<em> Nyctereutes procyonoides</em>,&#160;mainly&#160;in forest–swamp mosaics&#160;(competition for carrion in late winter); and the Beech Marten&#160;<em>Martes foina</em>&#160;(interference in human settlements and their surroundings) (Sidorovich 2011, V.E. Sidorovich <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em> 2016). In Latvia the species is possibly being displaced from some areas around human settlement by Beech Marten&#160;(J. Ozolins <em>pers. comm. </em>2015).<br/><br/>The extent to which hybridisation threatens populations is unclear. Hybridisation&#160;with wild-living Domestic Ferrets&#160;<em>Mustela furo</em>&#160;occurs&#160;in the United Kingdom (Costa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013) but it&#160;seems unlikely that on the mainland populations will in the long-term depart phenotypically from wild-type Polecats. In Britain feral Ferrets generally only thrive on islands and appear to be unable to withstand competition from&#160;<em>M. putorius</em>&#160;(A. Kitchener <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em> 2015). In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, introgression with Domestic Ferret was found in 6% of 34 individuals tested genetically, and in 10% of 104 checked morphologically (for skull constriction) (A. Weber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;Overall,&#160;the zone of sympatry between&#160;Western Polecat&#160;and&#160;Steppe Polecat&#160;<em>M. eversmanii</em> includes 43% of the former's&#160;distribution area and 20% of the latter's (Ternovski and Ternovskaya 1994). Wild-taken hybrids are held in museums of&#160;Ukraine, Belarus, and also in the Rostov-on-Don and Orel cities (Russia) (Ternivski and Ternovskaya 1994). The&#160;sympatry is not the result of recent range expansion,&#160;suggesting that&#160;such hybridisation is unlikely to be a threat to the&#160;species. Hybridisation also occurs with European Mink <em>M. lutreola</em>, but again this&#160;seems unlikely to be a threat to this&#160;species.<br/><br/>Mustelids are described as vulnerable to accidental mortality from road&#160;traffic (Birks 1993) and the widespread&#160;steep&#160;increase of road traffic in western Europe and increasingly elsewhere in the&#160;species' range might have population-level effects in areas of high&#160;road density. Moreover, the presence of Polecat prey on and near road-verges may also increase its traffic collision mortality of the predator (Birks 1993, Barrientos and Bolonio 2008).","In general the&#160;Western&#160;Polecat&#160;population is believed to be large and relatively stable in the eastern half to three-quarters&#160;of its range. Considerations&#160;of population trend must take into account that it loses&#160;more than half its population from autumn to spring annually (D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2016). It is common in forested areas of European Russia, where the population&#160;density&#160;is&#160;about one individual per km² in winter in the southern taiga zone from the Belarus border in the west to Izhevsk city in the east (D. Skumatov <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). There is no precise&#160;information on population trend in the country. It is not a focus&#160;of the state hunting monitoring;&#160;information is collected only incidentally to the main species for monitoring and the hunting bag is not recorded&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). However,&#160;over its large range in the&#160;Russian&#160;Federation, which comprises a large proportion of the&#160;species' entire global range,&#160;annual official monitoring of wildlife by&#160;snow-tracking&#160;suggests&#160;that it is&#160;relatively&#160;stable, perhaps with&#160;some decline (but much less than 20%)&#160;since 2000&#160;(A. Saveljev <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015, D.&#160;Skumatov <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;Based on hunters' opinions, the population is&#160;stable or&#160;increasing in Estonia&#160;(T. Maran <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;In Latvia the population is widespread and healthy, although the species is possibly being displaced from some areas around human settlement by Beech Marten&#160;<em>Martes foina</em>&#160;(J. Ozolins <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). By contrast, in Belarus, the&#160;species is believed to be in decline, and recent&#160;surveys in&#160;Naliboki Forest and its rural surroundings found only 4.7-8.3 individuals per 100 km² (Sidorovich 2011,&#160;V.E.&#160;Sidorovich <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Similarly,&#160;further&#160;south,&#160;in Romania, 2007/2008&#160;–&#160;2011/2012 hunting bag statistics and 2005–2013 population estimates (source: Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, www.mmediu.ro, accessed on 12 October 2014), for which there is no previous comparison period,&#160;converge in suggesting a 22–25% decline during the 14 years to 2013; notably, the hunting quota did not decline during&#160;2007/2008&#160;–&#160;2011/2012,&#160;so the drop in number taken was not driven by a change in regulation (A.D. Sandor <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Although the Polecat is considered by the public (game-keepers, scientists and lay public) to be the most common mustelid in Romania, a 2012–2014 transect survey for tracks&#160;focused on the centre and west of the country recorded it in only 54.25% of transects comprising apparently&#160;suitable habitat (compared with 65.57% for Pine Marten <em>Martes martes</em>, 76.12% for Wild Cat <em>Felis sylvestris</em> and 91.50% for Eurasian Otter <em>Lutra lutra</em>)&#160;(A.D.&#160;Sandor<em> pers. comm.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Western Europe, the species is scarce, typically occurring at densities of about 1 individual per 10 km², and rarely exceeding 5–10 individuals per 10 km², even in optimal habitat.&#160;In the United Kingdom numbers are now increasing, following a major persecution-driven decline from the 1800s to 1920s (Davison <em>et al</em>. 1999), although there is a significant degree of introgression with Domestic Ferret&#160;<em>M. furo</em> (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013). In France the&#160;species' conservation status was&#160;assessed&#160;in 2007 (2002–2006) and in 2013 (2007–2012): it was 'Unfavourable – Inadequate' in 2013 versus 'Unknown' in 2007 in two biogeographic regions (Alpine and Mediterranean), but the improvement of knowledge allowed assessment as 'Favourable' in the two other regions (Atlantic and Continental). Its&#160;range dropped from 11,263 to 3,300 km² in the Alpine region and from 37,199 to 15,600 km² in the Mediterranean region between 2007 and 2013; the total French distribution area was 465,680 km² in 2007 but only 334,300 in 2013&#160;(Bensettiti and Puissauve 2015). A modelling approach intending to account for the search effort predicted a probable decrease in&#160;Polecat numbers&#160;in 30% of the French agricultural regions whereas an increase was probable in 20% of them&#160;(Calenge <em>et al</em>. 2016, in press). The southern French population has presumably&#160;decreased in line with this range contraction although&#160;no precise number exist. In Switzerland, a massive decline took place until the late 1970s but since then the population has stabilised and even, locally (in the Grisons) increased (Hausser 1995, Anderegg 2004); road-kill&#160;statistics&#160;show a huge,&#160;sustained&#160;increase in reported Polecats between 2009 and 2014 (from 2 to 153), an increase mirrored in&#160;such observation of&#160;few other&#160;species, and thus more likely to reflect an increasing Polecat population than changed reporting behaviour (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Spain it&#160;seems to live at generally low densities&#160;(J. Herrero <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;Widespread declines are believed to be occurring in the Mediterranean climatic zones&#160;of&#160;Spain and Portugal, probably associated with use of pesticides but also reflecting the reduction of the European Rabbit&#160;<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus&#160;</em>population, but no quantitative data exist (E.J. Virgós <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015;&#160;I. Zuberogoitia <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015); the&#160;species is very much in the 'attention-shadow' of the larger carnivores. Intensive control programmes&#160;for American Mink&#160;<em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;in northern&#160;Spain reveal that the Polecat is now very&#160;scarce there&#160;(I. Zuberogoitia <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Austria, the hunting bag of polecats (Western and Steppe combined, the vast majority being the former) increased from 6,000 in 1955 to almost 14,000 in 1968 and then decreased back to 6,000 in 2003 (Reimoser <em>et al</em>. 2006). Official hunting bag&#160;statistics for 1983–2014 (provided by STATcube [Statistische Datenbank von Statistik Austria] per&#160;A Kranz <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016)&#160;show&#160;strong indication of periodical cycling (approximately 10 years between peaks, with troughs about three-quarters of the preceding peaks)&#160;but an obvious&#160;general downward trend resulting in an approximate halving of the hunting bag in the 31-year period. These data are consistent with ongoing&#160;population decline, but the role of variation in hunting effort is&#160;difficult to untangle, although at least the cycling&#160;seems more likely to reflect Polecat population than hunter behaviour. If&#160;so, this urges particular care when looking at trends in population (or in surrogates&#160;such as road-kills or hunting bags)&#160;derived from only a few years' data.<br/><br/>No monitoring or survey have been performed in Italy. The only data on this species's&#160;status&#160;come from road casualties, but these&#160;are not systematically collated. The present&#160;conservation status in Italy is thus&#160;considered unknown by the National Institute for Nature Protection (ISPRA)&#160;(M. Pavanello <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Germany, there is widespread&#160;opinion of decline, originally noted through decreasing hunting bags (A. Schreiber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In Saxony, there was&#160;a&#160;steep decrease during the late twentieth century (H. Ansorge&#160;<em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015). The most detailed information comes from Saxony-Anhalt: between 1962–1989 and 2005–2014, the range in this state (total land area: 20,452 km²) dropped by 10,120 km²; and the number of Polecats found victim to road or rail accidents approximately halved between 2006–2007 and 2012, without the implementation of any polecat-specific&#160;protection measures on roads or railways, suggesting that the change reflects the local Polecat population density (A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;It is impossible to judge how representative these alarming results are for a wider area, because of the lack comparable case studies from elsewhere. Comparable declines are&#160;strongly&#160;suspected&#160;in at least three other federal states of Germany (Mecklenburg&#160;–&#160;Western Pomerania, Brandenburg and Thuringia; more or less all eastern federal states with equal agricultural methods)&#160;(A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015). Moreover, there is nothing obviously unique about the general situation of agriculture and other human factors in these&#160;states of Germany, making it quite plausible that the situation is similar across much of&#160;Central Europe's agricultural landscape.<br/><br/>The status of the North African populations part of, or allied to, this species is poorly known; the species&#160;may now be very rare (Gippoliti 2011, Ahmim 2013,&#160;Griffiths and Cuzin 2013).",Decreasing,"Western&#160;Polecat is widespread in the western Palaearctic east to the Ural Mountains in the Russian Federation; it is absent from Ireland, northern Scandinavia, much of the Balkans, much of the eastern Adriatic coast, and occurs in&#160;Greece&#160;only marginally, in the north. It is widespread in France, less&#160;so in the&#160;south-west and&#160;south-east&#160;(Berzins and Ruette 2014, Calenge <em>et al</em>. 2015), in mainland Spain (Grupo de carnívoros terrestres de la SECEM 2001,&#160;Virgós&#160;2007), in Romania (A.D.&#160;Sandor <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015) and in many other countries of its range.&#160;Since the year 2000 many distribution gaps in the Swiss Midlands and Jura have been filled and in the Grisons the species has expanded its range in the Vorderrhein Valley to almost the Oberalp Pass, and in the Vorderrhein Valley to the Via Mala area (Infofauna 2016).<br/><br/>There is&#160;some evidence of northern range expansion recently (references cited in&#160;Zabala&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, T. Maran <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;The north-eastern border of regular occurrence runs approximately to Arkhangelsk city, Syktyvkar city and Perm city (Russia); north and east of this&#160;line, it&#160;is very rare, being replaced over the River Kama by its ecological analogue, Siberian Weasel&#160;<em>M. sibirica</em>;&#160;wild hybrids between the two, from west of the Kama, are known (D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). It has recently been recorded at Cherdyn' (Perm province) at about 60°30'N, 57°E (S. Glebov per D. Skumatov <em>pers. comm. </em>2016). Western&#160;Polecat&#160;inhabits&#160;the west slope of the Middle and South Urals; recent occurrence east of the Urals&#160;(up to Kurgan city) is possible, but not proven. The species&#160;inhabits the&#160;forest-steppe zone from the&#160;southern Urals&#160;to the River Volga, River Don and the Azov Sea. To the&#160;south occurs&#160;Steppe&#160;Polecat&#160;<em>M. eversmanii</em>; hybridisation occurs&#160;(Ternovski and Ternovskaya 1994).<br/><br/>Populations of disputed taxonomic identity that are either part of, or close to, this species are found in North Africa, in the Moroccan Rif Mountains (Griffiths and Cuzin 2013) and in adjacent Algeria (Ahmim 2013). The feral range of the Domestic Ferret <em>Mustela furo</em>&#160;includes&#160;some&#160;areas within&#160;Western&#160;Polecat's native range (e.g. Britain) and some outside it such as New Zealand (Clapperton 2001).<br/><br/>In Europe,&#160;Western&#160;Polecat&#160;has been recorded from&#160;sea-level&#160;up to at least 1,600 m a.s.l. in&#160;Spain&#160;(Virgós&#160;2007) and&#160;up to 1,400 m for the French Pyrenees (C. Arthur <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016) and 1,500 m for the French Alps (P. Rigaux <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016); previous&#160;statements of occurrence up to 2,000 m a.s.l. in France remain to be corroborated, although in&#160;Switzerland&#160;there are recent records&#160;at altitudes&#160;probably above 1900 a.s.l. (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016). The African populations occur from&#160;sea level to 2,400 m (Griffiths and Cuzin 2013).","Western&#160;Polecat is legally hunted in&#160;the&#160;Russian&#160;Federation&#160;and in various other countries&#160;for its fur. Because of the high variety of shades of hairs and their gradations it is difficult to find two or three hides of the same coloration, and it is impossible to find thirty or fifty similar hides for a jacket – hence Western Polecat furs harvested from the wild can be found on the Russian domestic market only in the form of smaller handicraft products&#160;such as&#160;hats and caps (N. Dronova and A. Vaisman per R. Melisch <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016). Industrial production use farmed hides from hybrid forms. According to Sergey Stolbov, President of the Russian Fur Union (A. Vaisman&#160;per R. Melisch <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2016), Western Polecat, as the&#160;species is treated by the Red List&#160;(pure-bred offspring of individuals taken from the wild), has never been farmed for hide production. Hybrids with Domestic Ferret&#160;(i.e. <em>M. putoris</em> ×&#160;<em>M. (putoris) furo</em>) are, however, farmed in Russia at two fur farms (one in Pushkino close to Moscow, one in Tver province) in industrial volumes, producing about 30,000-35,000 hides per year. These are&#160;all solely for the Russian domestic market and there are multiple regularly breeding coloured forms of furs: pearl, golden, snowy-white, coal-black, etc. Statements that&#160;the species is&#160;farmed for fur in the Russian Far East (e.g. Dronova and Shestakov 2005), many thousand kilometres from its natural range, are likely also to refer to the said hybrid form.<br/><br/>The EU-TWIX database and mailing list exchanges which concentrate on information on seized specimen of fauna and flora from the wild hold, as of February 2016, no information relating to this species. (http://www.eutwix.org/ ; http://www.traffic.org/home/2015/12/3/eu-twix-ten-years-of-enforcement-assistance.html; V. Sacré &#160;per&#160;R. Melisch&#160;<em>pers. comm. </em>2016). There is also no seizure information held in China on the&#160;species&#160;(Xiao Yu per&#160;R. Melisch&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).",Terrestrial,"Given the widespread&#160;opinion and localised evidence&#160;of recent steep declines in continental western Europe, the most important conservation&#160;requirement is for research to clarify the range of threats, and, for each, the intensity and geographic&#160;spread, to allow the design and implementation of effective conservation measures where they are needed. In particular, it is urgent to undertake, across Europe,&#160;research comparable to that&#160;in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, which has indicated&#160;recent steep declines there (A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015;&#160;see 'Population'&#160;section).<br/><br/>Western&#160;Polecat is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and Annex V of the EU Council’s Directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (EU Habitats Directive). It is protected in Italy (M. Pavanello <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016) and under Schedule 6 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (UK) and&#160;by the regional Red Data Book on southern border of its Russian&#160;area, in Rostovskaya oblast’ (Rostov-na-Donu city)&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In Spain, it is listed in the national&#160;Red Data Book&#160;as Near Threatened (Virgós&#160;2007). In Switzerland it was categorised as Vulnerable in 1994; it will&#160;shortly be reassessed (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;The species was&#160;included in the 'pre-warning list' (analogous&#160;to Near Threatened) for Germany in 1998 and was&#160;kept therein in the new edition of the German Red List in 2009. This status is a compromise between the various red lists of the many German Bundesländer (provinces), some of which classify the polecat in higher threat categories, while there could still be provinces where the polecat is not included yet at all&#160;(A. Schreiber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;It is registered in Annex V to DHFF (Directive Habitats-Faune-Flore), France, and therefore benefited from an assessment of its conservation status in 2007 (2002–2006) and in 2013 (2007–2012) (Bensettiti and Puissauve 2015). It receives at least some level of protection in many other range&#160;states. In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, where&#160;steep declines have recently been demonstrated,&#160;hunting is prohibited for the period 2015-2019 (with possibility of extension) to preserve Polecat numbers. This has prompted intensive&#160;study of&#160;occurrence, population dynamics, genetic monitoring, and survey of carcases&#160;(A. Weber<em> pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;It occurs in many protected areas across its range.<br/><br/>The decline in Switzerland up to the 1970s was combated by the improvement of habitat by creation of new ponds for amphibians and revitalisation of small rivers (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In much of continental western Europe it is very important to widen and restore river-banks and wetlands and to accept Eurasian Beaver <em>Castor fiber&#160;</em>as a promotor of natural habitat development. It is similarly important to restore the edges of woods and hedges and to minimise mowing of fallow agricultural land and of field boundaries. Restocking operations are trying to rebuild some Rabbit populations, particularly in the Mediterranean region (Letty&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006), but methods need to be improved (Calvete&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, Moreno&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). These transactions may prove beneficial in maintaining the Polecat (Birks 2000). Conservation of&#160;Eurasian Hamster <em>Cricetus cricetus</em> is beneficial to the Polecat and warrants wider implementation.<br/><br/>Where either occurs, control of American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;and Raccoon Dog <em>Nyctereutes procyonoides</em>&#160;important to prevent declines of Western Polecat.&#160;Reduced release of Domestic Ferrets <em>Mustela furo&#160;</em>into the wild would reduce the (apparently rather low) threat from introgression.<br/><br/>The taxonomic and conservation status of the North African populations part of, or allied to, this species is poorly known. They may now be very rare, an issue of concern if they are an autochthonous, potentially somewhat taxonomically distinct, form (Gippoliti 2011, Ahmim 2013,&#160;Griffiths and Cuzin 2013).

Although local declines have occurred, the species is secure in many areas.","This species is found along streams and lakes as well as in swamps and marshes. It prefers densely vegetated areas. It dens under stones or the roots of trees, in expropriated beaver <em>Castor</em>&#160;or Muskrat <em>Ondatra</em> houses, or in self-excavated burrows (Nowak 2005). The species can be found in xeric habitats if food is abundant (Arnold and Fritzell 1990). <br/>Strictly carnivorous, its diet reflects the local prey base (Ben-David <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Typical prey are fish, amphibians, crustaceans, Muskrats, and small mammals (Day and Linn 1972,&#160;Chanin and Linn 1980,&#160;Birks and Dunstone 1985, Bueno 1994). Many other prey can be taken occasionally (Larievière 1999). Males have large home ranges that extend for a half mile or more along waterways and overlap with the smaller home ranges of several females (Wilson and Ruff 1999).","Wild populations of American Mink are still hunted for fur. Alteration of its habitat, namely densely vegetated river courses and other wetlands represents another potential threat to this species. The American Mink suffers&#160;from environmental pollution caused by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which may even cause infertility (Schreiber <em>et al.</em>&#160;1989).","Generally abundant throughout its distribution (Larivière 1999).

May be active at any hour but is mainly nocturnal. <br/><br/>Most food is obtained by excavating the burrows of fossorial rodents.&#160;Ground squirrels are often major item in diet, as are pocket gophers, kangaroo rats, priairie-dogs, and mice; also eats scorpions, insects, snakes, lizards, and birds, especially when ground squirrel population is low (Messick and Hornocker 1981). <br/><br/>Its movements are restricted, especially in winter, and it shows a strong attachment to a home area. Estimated home ranges vary from 2 to 725 ha, changing seasonally (Sargeant and Warner 1972). It is active all year, but it may sleep in its den for several days or weeks during severe winter weather (Nowak 2005).","Changing land use, resulting from agriculture, urban development, and forest ingrowth, appears&#160;to be a major factor negatively affecting American Badger. Declines may also be related to the persecution of its&#160;primary prey, prairie-dogs and ground squirrels (Apps&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002). Finley&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1976) speculated that some Colorado populations may have declined because of the elimination of prairie-dogs. Roadkills and habitat loss are the main threats in British Columbia (Newhouse and Kinley 2012).&#160;Trapping for pelts has in the past affected populations, mainly in response to high fur prices, but has not had a significant influence on populations in recent years. Badgers are also trapped, shot and poisoned because their diggings are thought to cause broken legs in livestock, lead to water loss from irrigation canals, and cause damage to vehicles encountering their burrows (Scobie 2002).<br/><br/>Although clearing of forests for agricultural land has probably resulted in some range expansion, cultivation of grassland has undoubtedly caused declines (Soper 1964, Stardom 1979, Lindzey 1982, Smith 1992). Likewise, intensification of agriculture is likely to cause declines in the future.<br/><br/>Much mortality is caused by vehicles or deliberate killing by people (Stardom 1979, Messick <em>et al.</em> 1981, Newhouse and Kinley 2012, Apps <em>et al</em>. 2002). Badgers may actually be attracted to roads, both because ground squirrels often burrow alongside them (Ketcheson and Bauer 1995), and because they are good travel routes (Warner and Ver Steeg 1995).","Large range in the western and central U.S.A., southern Canada, and northern and central Mexico; relatively common over much of this&#160;range, but probably has declined substantially in areas converted from grassland to intensive agriculture and where colonial rodents such as prairie-dogs <em>Cynomys&#160;</em>and ground squirrels <em>Spermophilus&#160;</em>are reduced or eliminated. Also potentially threatened by collisions with vehicles and by direct persecution.&#160;Badger populations have declined throughout its&#160;northern range, through declining habitat suitability (Newhouse and Kinley 2012).<br/><br/>The U.S. population was&#160;roughly estimated at several hundred thousand and the Canadian has ane ven lower estimate (Newhouse and Kinley 2012).

Ringtail fur is of poor quality (thin, non-durable, and subject to fading), and pelts have usually sold for less than US$5 each although they have brought as much as US$12. The justification for trapping Ringtails for fur is weak, especially because in none of the states where trapping is legal is there sufficient knowledge of population levels and trends on which to base valid harvest regulations (Glatston 1994).

Habitat loss over this period has been the predominant driver of decline in the southern (Sundaic) portion of the range, where a significant proportion of lowland habitats have been converted to other land-uses that do not support the species e.g. oil palm plantations. In the northern portion of the range the rampant hunting and trade of mammals in this size-class (within northern South-east Asia and up into China; e.g. Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004), within which Binturong is a significant part, has severely depressed populations even within remaining large blocks of little-degraded forest (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014; Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3). Populations in the northern range continue to be threatened by wildlife hunting and by the recent proliferation of agro-industries and other forms of forest conversion in the region, which are causing habitat loss in some protected areas that potentially still hold the species. Thus the species is considered to be experiencing population declines sufficient to meet the threshold for Vulnerable in this northern part of its range on the basis of actual or potential levels of exploitation, with habitat loss being an additional factor (e.g. WWF 2013). In the Sundaic portion of the range, habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands (e.g.&#160;Holmes 2000;&#160;BirdLife International 2001; Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001; McMorrow and Talip 2001; Lambert and Collar 2002; Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004; Fuller 2004;&#160;Sodhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010;&#160;Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014; Stibig&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This forest loss, particularly in the lowlands, is predicted to continue within the next three generations within parts of the species’s range (e.g. Borneo). However, in other parts, much lowland forest has already gone, and future forest loss, proportionate to what remains, is likely to slow down in some areas. Because there is no evidence that Binturong uses the plantations that,&#160;largely,&#160;are replacing natural forest in this region (e.g. Semiadi <em>et al</em>. in prep.), major declines can be inferred based on decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality. There is insufficient information about Binturong usage of high-altitude forests (where forest is being lost more slowly), however, it is certainly not primarily a montane species and lowland forest habitats are thought to be the most suitable, and on this basis the populations in the Sundaic portion of the range are also judged to be declining at rates sufficient to warrant listing as Vulnerable, mainly through habitat loss compounded with killing and capture.","Binturong is primarily arboreal, but does descend to the ground; in fact the number of camera-trap photographs of this species across its range reveals a level of ground activity higher than had previously been unexpected for this species. Also, the species has been caught in baited live traps set on the ground (Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is heavy and ponderous (adults can reach over 20 kg), and where more agile arboreal animal species could leap between trees, it must descend to the ground to go from one tree to another (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The ecology of this species is poorly known and might vary between areas; information about diel activity is&#160;conflicting. Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted it to be crepuscular and nocturnal, &#160;and targeted small carnivore surveys at a logging concession in Sarawak, Borneo (Malaysia), recorded the species only during the early morning and during the night (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010). By contrast,&#160;Nettelbeck (1997) found it often to be active during the day, and many other day-time field sightings have been made incidentally during forest research (e.g. Lambert 1990, Datta 1999, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sayam Chowdhury pers. comm. 2015). Activity patterns have also been described as cathemeral (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>In&#160;Phu Kieo Wildlife Sanctuary,&#160;Thailand, Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) found that males have a mean annual range size of 6.2 km² with a mean overlap of 35%. A single female Binturong tracked in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary had a home range of 6.9 km² (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2015). The species is thought to be predominantly frugivorous. There is a detailed observation of a group of Binturongs feeding on figs <em>Ficus&#160;</em>over several nights in North-east India (Murali <em>et al</em>. 2013), and many of the incidental observations of the species are of animals in fruiting trees (e.g. Lambert 1990, Nettelbeck 1997, Datta 1999, Low 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, recent records are from extensive evergreen forest, (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the Philippines, the species is found in primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland-forest mosaic from sea level to 400 m (Rabor 1986, Esselstyn <em>et al</em>. 2004). It was recorded in secondary forest, that had been logged in the 1970s, and which surrounds a palm estate, in Malaysia in 2000–2001 by Azlan (2003). Mathai <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded the species in a logging concession, although never amid active logging; all records were from patches of forest with medium to high relative levels of contiguity. In Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, the Binturong was camera-trapped in all surveys of forest areas throughout the state, including primary and logged forest, but was not detected in oil palm plantations. &#160;In one survey it was detected at over 1,000 m a.s.l. (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald unpublished data). Elsewhere in Borneo it has been recorded down almost to sea-level (e.g. Sabangau National Park, Central Kalimantan; Semiadi et al. in prep.). Meijaard <em>et al</em>. (2008) classified the species as tolerant of moderate intensity logging, and it has been recorded from logged forest on Borneo (Samejima <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Bangladesh the few confirmed records are from hill evergreen forest in the north-east and south-east (Chakma 2015, Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). In Java the species has been observed in a mosaic open forest landscape, interspersed with agriculture and non-native forest plantations, where, in the&#160;several years of&#160;survey,&#160;there was only a single record of hunting of nocturnal mammals (Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014); the species is never (or only exceptionally rarely) recorded in such landscapes in northern South-east Asia, which are invariably hunted heavily, perhaps explaining this difference. There are no records of this species from within blocks of monoculture plantations such as palm oil or rubber.<br/><br/>The litter size is typically one to three, with a gestation of about 92 days, reaching adult size in one year; individuals may live as long as 18 years (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Litter size in captivity is one to six, most commonly two. Observations in captivity have shown that copulation usually takes place in trees.","Habitat loss and degradation are major threats to the Binturong (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989) as is fragmentation, particularly in those parts of the range where hunting is heavy. Throughout this species's range, there has been loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2010; WWF 2013, 2015; Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). Forest conversion has been extremely high in the lower-altitude parts of its Sundaic range in the last 20 years (e.g. Holmes 2000,&#160;BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003, Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006, Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014, Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014, Stibig <em>et al</em>. 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000–2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (national parks and protected forests; Rode-Margano <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in Kalimantan specifically, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985 to 2001 (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004). Lowland deforestation&#160;is now also a growing threat to populations in mainland South-east Asia (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2015). Choudhury (1997) noted that large-scale deforestation in Indian portions of the species’s range could be contributing to its increased rarity, because many former records come from areas where forests are now being degraded. In China, rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether (Pu <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Throughout South-east Asia, Binturong is hunted for its meat, for traditional medicines and as pets (Corlett 2007, Roberton 2007, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shepherd 2008, Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Philippines, this species is harvested for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is among the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R.J. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There is a large demand for civet meat, including Binturong, in China and Viet Nam (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004, Roberton 2007).<br/><br/>Recent camera-trapping evidence across the species’s range has made clear that the Binturong descends to the ground more frequently than had previously been thought; therefore, the threat of snaring to this species is likely to be more serious than had been assumed. Non-specific hunting of large mammals is very high across most of the species's mainland range, with industrial level cable-snaring especially prevalent in parts of northern South-east Asia. Given that the Binturong is relatively unafraid of people and is sometimes active during the day, it is often conspicuous both to surveyors (suggesting that the few encounters reflect a low population) and to hunters (thus exposing it to elevated risk) (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999); this is supported by verbal reports from wildlife hunters in North-east India (see Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). A number of national-, landscape- and survey-area-level reviews of small carnivore records in mainland South-east Asia have found Binturong to be infrequently recorded, and sometimes not at all, in relatively intensive camera-trap surveys (i.e. more than 1,000 effective camera-trap-nights) (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014; Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3). Although the species’s arboreality may in part explain the paucity of records, the large number of camera-trap&#160;surveys, some of which were targeted at species found in similar habitats e.g. Mainland Clouded Leopard <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>, and the hunting-pressures in this region that have caused the declines in a large range of animal species, suggests that the current infrequency of Binturong records from the mainland South-east Asia portion of its range may be a genuine indication of its rarity there and that this reflects recent decline.","Historically, the Binturong was often thought to be relatively common within its distribution range, but it is now mostly uncommon or rare, and is likely to be approaching national extinction in some range countries in mainland South-east Asia (including Viet Nam) and in China. Lekagul and McNeely (1977) stated that it was rare in Thailand, although Nettelbeck (1997) observed it frequently in a small and intensively watched part of Khao Yai National Park. In Lao PDR, there were only three sightings in the extensive wildlife surveys into some of the remotest parts of the country between 1992 and 1999 (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although the species is mostly arboreal, it is detectable using camera-traps, and relatively intensive post-1999 field surveys that have used this method in suitable habitat in protected areas have produced few or no records of this species in Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em> 2009, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a) and Viet Nam (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3), indicating apparently severe declines in these countries. There are very few camera-trap records from Cambodia, although live animals are relatively frequently confiscated from the wildlife trade there (N. Marx per J. Holden pers. comm. 2015). Thailand might be expected to hold one of the healthiest populations in mainland South-east Asia, but declines are suspected there as well (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Myanmar, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) confirmed camera-trap records from six survey areas (from Kachin state in the north to Tenasserim in the south), and the species has since been detected in most of the few recent (post-2013) camera-trap surveys in the country, with records from Karen state, Tanintharyi division, and from Tamanthi Wildlife Reserve in Sagaing division (WCS, NWCD, KWCI unpublished data per T.N.E. Gray 2015), suggesting that it might rival Thailand as a core country for the species’s conservation in mainland South-east Asia. There are very few records from Bangladesh, but a camera-trap photograph of an adult with young from the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Chakma 2015), suggests that there is a breeding population at least at this site. In North-east India, it is becoming rarer because of habitat loss, because it seems to prefer mature forest, and is mostly restricted to protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Medhalya, Nagaland, Tirupura and Sikkim (Choudhury 2013). It is approaching national extinction in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Binturong was detected by camera-traps in forest surveys across Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, including logged areas, but where logging activities were recent, detections were fewer than in both adjacent primary forest and older logged forest, suggesting a decline in population in logged areas, at least initially (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald, unpublished data). In Sumatra (Indonesia), the species is probably still widespread in the remaining lowlands in Aceh province and upland forests throughout Sumatra; it is relatively frequently observed and camera-trapped in the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra, up to 1,000 m a.s.l. (G. Fredriksson unpublished data 2015). Binturong is thought to be relatively common in Kerinci, West Sumatra (Holden 2006, J. Holden pers. comm. 2015). The bones of a Binturong were collected from a snare-trap set for Serow <em>Capricornis&#160;sumatrensis</em>&#160;at 2,500 m a.s.l. in Kerinci, West Sumatra (Holden 2006).&#160;In the Philippines, the species is localized and uncommon (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998): populations are thought to be decreasing as a result of collection for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"The Binturong is widespread in South and South-east Asia occurring from eastern Nepal, Bangladesh, north-east India and southern China through mainland and island South-east Asia, south-east to Java (Indonesia) and occurring also on the Philippine islands of&#160;Calauit and Palawan (Corbet and Hill 1992, Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998, Choudhury 2013). In North-east India it is known from all the states, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, West Bengal (northern parts), Sikkim and Tripura, being widespread in several of them (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species has been camera-trapped in Royal Manas National Park, Bhutan (Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2011), and is predicted to be present in other southern parts of Bhutan, where suitable habitat remains largely intact (A. U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2015). In Bangladesh there are confirmed sightings from the north-east (Tania Khan per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015), the Chittagong Hill Tracts were it has been camera-trapped (Chakma 2015), and in Cox’s Bazar district, south-east Bangladesh, where an animal was photographed (Sayam Chowdhury per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). Eastern Nepal represents the known western limit of the species’s geographic range, although no recent confirmed records could be traced (Sanjan Thapa pers. comm. 2015, Yadav Ghimirey pers. comm. 2015); but recent suitable survey in this part of the country has been very limited and the species is considered likely&#160;to persist there. It occurred, at least formerly, in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces of southern China, but there are few recent records, none outside Yunnan (Wang 2003, Lau<em> et al</em>. 2010, C. Huang pers. comm. 2015). It potentially occurred historically in Singapore although there are no known records from the country (Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no confirmed records from Brunei, but this is likely to be because of poor survey effort and not because of any ecological factors (Semiadi <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/><br/>It occurs from sea level up to 3,000 m a.s.l., although it is thought to live at higher densities in lowland forest habitats (i.e. below 1,000 m) (see the Habitats and Ecology section, below)","In the Philippines this species is caught for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is one of most frequently displayed caged live carnivores (e.g. five displayed in Pakxe market place during 2013; T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). In addition, skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Many of the animals traded are young (I. Johnson pers. comm.&#160;to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm.&#160;to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). In Viet Nam, there are a few recent records of this species kept as pets or display animals in hotels (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2015), and the species is also traded for Viet Nam’s wildlife meat and traditional medicine markets, for which a wide range of animal species are hunted (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). Binturong meat is valued locally in Arunachal Pradesh, North-east India (Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008; Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). Civets (Viverridae), including Binturongs, are traded their meat for across Peninsular Malaysia (Shepherd and Shepherd 2010). In Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and the hill districts of Assam in India, it is hunted opportunistically and its meat is taken for subsistence use&#160;(A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2015). In Indonesia, when ‘kopi luwak’ ('civet coffee') became a popular product among coffee makers and consumers, several local ‘luwak farmers’ in Lampung, Sumatra, were observed using captive Binturongs and Common Palm Civets <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em> to produce this coffee (G. Semiadi and Wirdateti unpublished data 2014). In early 2013 when the ‘civet lovers’ hobby in Indonesia emerged, Binturongs were traded, although the number of this species in collections is thought to be low. Several Binturongs were seen for sale for the exotic pet trade in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, in 2014 (G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015).",Terrestrial,"Stricter enforcement of legislation against poaching, wildlife trade, habitat degradation and deforestation is required to conserve Binturong. In India it has been on CITES Appendix III since 1989 (CITES 2015). It has also been listed under Schedule I of The Wild Life (Protection) Act of India; this gives the highest conservation status to any species. In Borneo, it is included on Schedule 2 of Sabah’s Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997, under which hunting and collection is allowed with appropriate license issued by the Sabah Wildlife Department, on Part II of the First Schedule of the Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998, and on Indonesia’s Government Regulation No 7. In Brunei, however, the Binturong is not legally protected. In Bangladesh it has complete protection under wildlife protection law of 2012. It is protected in Malaysia, Thailand (under WARPA 2003), and in Viet Nam (Appendix 1B; Decree 32/2006). In the Philippines, the Environmental Legal Assistance Center has been involved in controlling and enforcing wildlife laws. The&#160;species&#160;is listed as Critically Endangered on the China Red List.<br/><br/>Binturong occurs in many protected areas spread across its current range; however, the effectiveness of these reserves at protecting this species is highly variable: it has not been targeted as a conservation focus, or indeed even surveyed for, in many protected areas, and most of the confirmed records are from general surveys or by-catch from surveys aimed at other species. Detailed radio-tracking studies, combined with watching to pay particular attention to ground-level use, would aid,&#160;greatly, understanding of this species’s ecology and therefore (i) a far more confident assessment of whether the lack of camera-trap records from some areas is a genuine reflection of decline/absence, and not of ineffective camera-trap placement, and (ii) more effectively targeted conservation.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It avoids open habitats, but may occur even in small fragments of woodland in farmland or near villages, and usually is absent from rainforests, dense woodlands and woodland-moist savanna mosaics (e.g., miombo woodland in Angola; Delibes and Gaubert 2013). The Common Genet feeds mainly on small mammals, but will also take birds, other small vertebrates, insects, and fruits (Delibes and Gaubert 2013).&#160;Is not uncommonly found in proximity human buildings, people and their domestic animals, which could have implications for disease transmission (Admasu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).","Locally, Common Genets have been and are still killed for their meat, body parts, skin and fur. In Portugal this species is illegally killed in predator trapping for hunting management and this,&#160;together with road-kills,&#160;may be the most important sources of anthropogenic mortality. In south Portugal, although Genets seem to avoid highways, they are particularly sensitive to national roads (two paved lanes). Two thirds of the road-kills recorded over a 10-year period were subadults and the road-kill index was <em>ca</em>&#160;12.8 individuals/100 km/year (F. Carvalho unpubl. data).&#160;Overall, however, it is believed that these sources or mortality do not currently threaten local populations. The only exception concerns&#160;Ibiza, where the Genet is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of habitat caused by urbanisation and infrastructure and tourism development.","This is one of the most common small carnivores in its native range, though detailed data on density in Africa are scarce; in Serengeti, Waser (1980) estimated a density of 1.5&#160;±&#160;0.37 individuals/km². In Europe, this species is moderately abundant, with increasing populations in France, and densities of 0.3 to 0.98 individual/km²&#160;(Delibes 1999, Camps and Llimona 2004). It is common in suitable habitat throughout the Iberian peninsula (Palomo and Gisbert 2002), where populations are either stable or slowly increasing (Camps 2015). On Ibiza, habitat is declining and becoming more fragmented, thus this species is suspected to be declining.",Stable,"Common Genet is a widespread species, occurring on the northern Saharan fringe (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and possibly Lybia), and then in open and dry savanna zones throughout sub-Saharan Africa in three large blocks, corresponding roughly to West Africa, East Africa and southern Africa (Delibes and Gaubert 2013). Also occurs in coastal regions of Arabia, Yemen and Oman (Harrison and Bates 1991); records from Palestine are in error (Schlawe 1980, Kock 1983).<br/><br/>               In Europe, this species occurs in all of continental Portugal and Spain, Andorra, and western, south-western and southeastern France (Delibes 1999, Gaubert <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also found on the Mediterranean islands of Majorca, Ibiza, and Cabrera (Balearic Islands; Delibes 1999). There are also scattered records from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and north-west Italy (Delibes 1999). In the latter country the presence of the species seems to be the result of natural colonisation from France, whereas the records&#160;from the former countries are likely to have been from the unintentional release of captive animals.&#160;Phylogeographic analyses confirmed that this species has been introduced to Europe and the Balearic islands (Gaubert <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, 2011).

45224953,3590,Callorhinus ursinus,Vulnerable,A2b,2015,2015-03-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The global population of Northern Fur Seals includes breeding areas extending from the Kuril Islands of Russia, across the Bering Sea, south to the west coast of the United States with the southernmost rookery in the Channel Islands of California. The population has shown inconsistent trends at particular areas with the most dramatic change occurring at the largest breeding rookery, St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska. The Pribilof population has experienced a significant, steep decline in recent years and has failed to recover despite the cessation of commercial harvesting. Although the global population is still in excess of a million animals, the current downward trends in abundance at St. Paul and nearby St. George Island remain unexplained. The Pribilof Islands population represents just under one half of the world-wide population and has declined by approximately 66% over the last three generations (1972–2014). The global change in abundance during that same period was 30.1% (95% CI -47.1% to 14.5%). Therefore, Northern Fur Seals should remain in the IUCN Red List category of Vulnerable under criterion A2b (due to the fact that the causes of the reduction do not appear to have ceased, are not understood, and may not be reversible based on the unknown cause, and that an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (direct counting and mark-recapture) was used to assess population size).","Northern Fur Seals exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with adult males measuring 30-40% longer and more than 4.5 times heavier than adult females. Males can be as large as 2.1 m and 270 kg. Adult females can measure 1.5 m and 50 kg or more. Newborns weigh 5.4-6 kg, and are 60-65 cm long. Pups are blackish at birth, with variable oval areas of buff color on the sides, in the axillary area, and on the chin and sides of the muzzle. After three to four months, pups moult to the colour of adult females and subadults. Northern Fur Seals become sexually mature at three to five years old, at which time females can produce one pup each year for most of the rest of their lives (Scheffer and Wilke 1953,&#160;Scheffer 1962). Kuzin (1999) noted that at times of rapid population growth on Tuleny Island, some females were fertilized as early as age two with five year old females achieving a pregnancy rate of 80%. Gestation lasts 51 weeks, which includes a delay of implantation of 3.5-4.0 months (York and Scheffer 1997). Females may produce pups up to age 23 (Lander 1981). Males do not become physically mature, and large enough to compete for a territory that will be used by females, until they are eight to nine years old. The generation time for females is approximately 12-15 years depending on the determination methods used. Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013) estimated the generation time at 14.1 years.<br/><br/>Breeding on the Pribilof Islands occurs from mid-June through August, with a peak in early July (the median date in southern California is approximately two weeks earlier than at the Pribilofs). This is a highly polygynous species. Males arrive at the rookeries up to one month before females and vocalize, display, and fight to establish and maintain territories.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals usually give birth a day after arrival at the rookery. Mean time from birth to estrous is 5.3 days, followed by a departure for a mean of 8.3 days for the first feeding trip. Females breeding at the Pribilof Islands of Alaska are located relatively far from the foraging areas, which are concentrated at the edge of the continental shelf and hence females in this population consistently make longer foraging trips than most other female otariids, with a mean trip length of 6.9 days. Once foraging begins the mean depth of dives is 68 m and average duration is 2.2 minutes with maximum depth recorded of 207 m and maximum duration of 7.6 minutes. Pups are visited eight to 12 times over the lactation period and attended for a mean of 2.1 days during each visit, before being abruptly weaned at four months old.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals are one of the most pelagic pinnipeds. They spend most of the year at sea, and rarely (if ever) returning to land between one breeding season and the next. Thus, males spend an average of only 45 days ashore a year and females only 35 days a year. Once weaned, juveniles go to sea and do not haul out until they return, usually to the island of their birth, two to three years later. At sea, Northern Fur Seals are most likely to be encountered alone or in pairs, with groups of three or more being uncommon. They forage relatively far from shore, over the edge of the continental shelf and slope. Diving is concentrated around dawn and dusk. Northern Fur Seals spend quite a bit of time rafting at the surface, either asleep or grooming. Many animals, especially juveniles, migrate from the Bering Sea south to California or the waters off Japan, to spend the winter feeding. (Sterling <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The Northern Fur Seal diet varies by site, oceanic domain and season and includes many varieties of epipelagic and vertically-migrating mesopelagic schooling and non-schooling fish and squid. Prey species of importance in the waters off California and Washington include Anchovy, Hake, Saury, Salmon, and several species of Squid and Rockfish. On the Pribilof Islands, prey species reflect foraging patterns on and off the continental shelf. Satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis indicate that those seals foraging on the shelf use typical on-shelf species like Walleye Pollock, Pacific Herring and gadid species while off shelf foragers included species such as myctophids. Bogoslof Island in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska is a volcanic island surrounded by deep water and the most common prey species there included Northern Smoothtongue and gonatid squid species (Zeppelin and Orr 2010).<br/><br/>Predators include Killer Whales, Sharks and Steller Sea Lions (Gentry 1998).","Northern Fur Seals have one of the longest and most complex histories of commercial harvesting, which began when the main breeding colonies were discovered in the late 18th century; exploitation continued through until 1984. Numerous international treaties and agreements were put in force over time in efforts to manage this species, and they are no longer harvested commercially. Small numbers are taken annually by Alaska Natives in a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. Harvest levels are declining and are unlikely to be affecting the status of the Fur Seal population.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals compete for Walleye Pollock with one of the largest commercial fisheries world. Measurable annual mortality, especially for juveniles and subadults, is caused by entanglements in derelict and discarded fishing gear, marine debris and direct interactions with commercial fisheries. This mortality was highest during the period of active high seas drift net fishing in the North Pacific in the 1980s, but entanglement in debris is an ongoing problem. Long-term ecosystem regime change in the North Pacific and possible changes in the foraging patterns of a key predator (the Killer Whale), may be working synergistically with the fisheries related issues to cause the current population decline.<br/><br/>Like all fur seals, Northern Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation. The small colonies at San Miguel Island in the California Channel Islands and on the Farallon Island may be at greatest risk due to proximity to major harbours, shipping lanes and offshore oil extraction facilities.<br/><br/>The effect of global climate change on Northern Fur Seals is uncertain. However, any further negative disruption of their ecosystem should be considered a threat.","The population history for Northern Fur Seals throughout the North Pacific and Bering Seas has been tied to the harvest of seals for their pelts (Kuzin 1999, NMFS 2007). Between the mid 1700s and early 1800s, Russian sealers used Aleut labour to harvest an average of 100,000 Fur Seals, mostly pups, annually in Alaskan waters (Roppel 1984). The commercial harvest of Fur Seals on the Pribilof Islands continued with periodic modifications to the sex/age classes of focus until and after the United States purchase of Alaska in 1867. In the late 1800s and early 1900s commercial harvests on land and pelagic sealing continued unregulated until the Fur Seal act of 1911 was signed by Japan, Russia, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States. This treaty prohibited pelagic sealing and reduced the take on land which at its peak in 1868 had harvested 240,000 seals in a single year (Roppel and Davey 1965, NMFS 2007).<br/><br/>In the early 1900s the Pribilof stock continued to grow in abundance despite commercial harvest. Between 40,000 and 126,000 seals were harvested each year during 1943-1968 (NMFS 2007). A new harvest regime was followed in the early 1960s which allowed for annual harvests of approximately 300,000 adult females and 30,000-96,000 subadult males (York and Hartley 1981). The population did not increase as anticipated after this new regime and ultimately commercial harvest of Fur Seals was terminated on St. George Island in 1973 and on St. Paul Island in 1983. Subsistence harvest of subadult males has continued on both islands since that time (NMFS 2007). In 2014, subsistence harvest rules were changed to allow the annual take of up to 150 male pups on St. George Island during a new autumn harvest season. This harvest occurred for the first time in the autumn of 2014.<br/><br/>Contrasting to the Northern Fur Seal abundance trend on the Pribilof Islands is Bogoslof Island, a small volcanic island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Northern Fur Seals were first reported on Bogoslof in 1976 with the first breeding seals noted in 1980 (Lloyd <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1981, Loughlin and Miller 1989). Subsequent surveys revealed an exponential growth rate during the 1990s and early 2000s with the estimated number of pups increasing at a rate of 48.5% annually between the time pups were first observed in 1980 and 2005. This rate then dropped to approximately 10% annually between 2005-2011, the last time the island was surveyed. Such a dramatic growth rate can only be explained by a combination of recruitment and immigration from other sites (Ream <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999). Recent studies suggest that the recent slowing in growth rate coupled with increases in foraging trip duration and distance may represent a typical density dependent response to a limited resource (Kuhn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Northern Fur Seal population on Bogoslof has increased to the point that it is the second largest Northern Fur Seal rookery in the United States, surpassing St. George Island. This growth has served to ameliorate the overall decline of the population.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seal rookeries in Russia have not been counted since 2006-2009 depending on the site. However, basic trends until that time are documented. Overharvesting in the 19th century eradicated the population on the Kuril Islands where Northern Fur Seals were considered extinct until the mid 1950s. Pup production grew rapidly on the Kurils during 1962-1977 (19.9% annual increase). The population stabilized around 1978 and trend became slightly negative (-0.8%) during 1978-1988. Pup production in the Kuril Islands has increased 82.4% since 1988 (+3.8% annually) and is now comparable to the Tuleny (Robben) Island population. During the last count in 2006, approximately 27,090 pups were counted. Total abundance of Fur Seals in the Kuril Islands currently exceeds 100,000 individuals (Kuzin 1999).<br/><br/>In 1999, A. Kuzin published a detailed description of the biology and history of Northern Fur Seals in Russia with special emphasis on Tuleny Island. He reported that the population at Tuleny at the time of its discovery in 1852 was approximately 120,000. Subsequent unregulated harvest reduced the population to as low as a few thousand animals in the late 1890s. Tuleny Island then underwent a series of population highs and low during various periods of harvest. The maximum population was approximately 180,000 individuals in the late 1960s (Kuzin 1999). The most recent estimate was 140,000 individuals including 42,200 pups in 2009 (Kuzin 2010).<br/><br/>The San Miguel stock of Northern Fur Seals breeds primarily on San Miguel Island, California, at the southern extent of the breeding range. This population has increased or been stable since its discovery in 1968 (Caretta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The trend in pup births includes a steady increase followed by a sharp decline that has been shown to be directly tied to El Niño events; pup production in 1997-1998 declined 81% due to the redistribution of prey caused by the event. Overwinter satellite telemetry studies have shown that Northern Fur Seals from all of the US breeding sites use similar foraging grounds along the west coast of Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon (Lea <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Ream <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Sterling and Ream 2004). The overlap is not limited to foraging habitat as genetic studies indicate that there is very little differentiation between animals throughout the range (Dickerson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Population estimates for Northern Fur Seals are generally derived by multiplying pup counts by a correction factor of 4.4747 to include all non-pups. A global abundance estimate was generated from the most recently available count and estimate data for all subpopulations in the range using the agTrend model (Johnson and Fritz 2014). The 2014 estimate for localities other than the Pribilofs is a projected number based on the trends at each site. The modelled population estimate used all of the data available since 1966 to project the estimates reported above. The most recent actual count and estimated numbers used in the model are shown below.<br/><br/>Pribilof Islands, 2014<br/><br/>St. Paul Island: 91,737 pups x 4.4747 = 410,496 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>St. George Island: 18,937 pups x 4.474 = 84,737 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>Sea Lion Rock: 5,250 pups x 4.4747 = 23,492 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>Commander Islands, 2006: 59,805 x 4.4747 = 267,609 (Burkanov and Calkins 2007)<br/><br/>Tuleny Island, 2009: 42,200 x 4.4747 = 188,832 (Kuzin 2010)<br/><br/>Kuril Islands, 2006: 25,164 pups x 4.4747 = 112,601(Burkanov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007)<br/><br/>Bogoslof Island, 2011: 22,905 pups x 4.4747 = 102,493 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012)<br/><br/>San Miguel Island, 2014 (not including Castle Rock): 2,327 x 4.4747 = 10,412 (A. Orr, NMFS pers. comm.)<br/><br/>Farallon Islands, 2014: 656 pups x 4.4747 = 2,935 (R. Berger, Point Blue Conservation Science pers. comm.)<br/><br/>The global population of Northern Fur Seals is estimated to be approximately 1.29 million in 2014, a decline of approximately 658,000 since 1976. Note that this number is different than the sum of abundances given above because most were projected forward to 2014 in the model. Using the agTrend model to project the population reduction at all sites over the past three generations (1972-2014) gives an estimated reduction of 30.1% (95% CI -47.1% to 14.5%). Annual abundance estimates for the entire range do not exist as there are no consistent monitoring strategies in place. Although abundance is declining, the overall decline is not proportional across all sites. The greatest decreases are occurring in the Pribilof Islands, while populations in the Kuril Islands and Tuleny Island in Russia, and on Bogoslof Island in Alaska have increased.<br/><br/>The decline described above understates the total reduction of the Northern Fur Seal population in historic times. It is estimated that the population numbered up to 2.5 million animals in the 1950s, and it may have been considerably larger than that when there were many more active rookeries before the onset of human exploitation.<br/><br/>To date the only population viability analysis conducted for Northern Fur Seals was described in a report from the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (Olesiuk 2012). This analysis concluded that all subpopulations are presently secure with little risk (0.00%-0.42%) of extirpation within the next century.",Decreasing,"Northern Fur Seals are a widely-distributed pelagic species in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan. They range from northern Baja California, Mexico, north and offshore across the North Pacific to northern Honshu, Japan. The southern limit of their distribution at sea is approximately 35°N (Rice 1998). Vagrants reach the Yellow Sea in the west and eastern Beaufort Sea to the north. They breed on rookeries in Russia (Kuril Islands, Commander Islands and Tuleny Island (Kuzin 1999), Alaska (Pribilof Islands and Bogoslof Island) and California (San Miguel Island) (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). In the past, the vast majority of the population bred at rookeries on the Pribilof Islands, with substantial numbers on the Commander Islands. However, a significant population decline on the Pribilofs concurrent with the establishment of a new breeding site in the eastern Aleutian Islands and population increases in the Kuril Islands of Russia has resulted in the Pribilof Islands now representing approximately 45% of the global population.","Northern Fur Seals have a long and complex history of commercial harvesting, which began when the main breeding colonies were discovered in the late 18th century. Commercial exploitation continued through 1984, and there were many periods of decline and recovery over this long period. Numerous international treaties and agreements were put in force in efforts to manage harvests. There is currently no commercial harvesting.<br/><br/>Small numbers of Northern Fur Seals are taken annually by Alaska Natives in a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. For the period 1999-2014, the average annual harvest on St. Paul Island was 463 subadult males/year. Subsistence harvest has declined in recent years such that the harvest has not exceeded 400 since 2005 on St. Paul. On St. George Island an average of 218 males were taken annually between 1985 and 2012 (Angliss and Allen 2009, Allen and Angliss 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Following the termination of the Interim Convention on the Conservation of the North Pacific Fur Seal in 1984, the Northern Fur Seal is now managed on land independently by the Russian Commonwealth of Independent States and the United States.

45225150,6204,Cystophora cristata,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2015-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although there is no reliable, current estimate for Hooded Seal abundance, the population is thought to be relatively large, numbering some few hundreds of thousands. The West Ice stock has been surveyed four times in the last 15 years, most recently in 2012, and it has been declining at a rate of 3.7%/year. The stock in Canadian waters increased during the 1980s and 1990s but the rate of increase was declining over time and with no surveys since 2005 there is no way to know the recent or current trend. However, with changing sea ice conditions reducing the pack ice habitat needed by all Hooded Seals for pupping and molting, there is good reason to believe that numbers in all stocks might be declining. Assuming that the entire population will decline at 3.7%/year (which is the West Ice rate of decline currently), the three generation reduction would be 75% which qualifies Hooded Seals for listing as Endangered under criterion A3c. Even if the overall rate of decline were only 1%/year the three generation decline would be 32%, which would qualify Hooded Seals as being Vulnerable. Given that the population is still relatively large, and there are uncertainties about the rate of future decline we opt for the more modest listing of Vulnerable under criterion A3c for Hooded Seals at this time.","Hooded Seals are a sexually dimorphic ice-breeding pinniped. Adult males average 2.5 m in length and weigh 300 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986), with large animals reaching over 400 kg (Kovacs 2002). Adult females are smaller, averaging 2.2 m and 160 kg, but can reach 300 kg. Pups are born at approximately 1 m in length and 24 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals pup on pack ice late in the spring season, when the pack is already breaking up. The breeding season for this polygynous species is very short, usually lasting only about 2.5 weeks. Males attend a single female and her pup at a time, sequentially re-establishing with a new female if the male is competitively successful (Kovacs 1990). Mating takes place in the water (Boness <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1988). Hooded Seals have the shortest lactation period of any mammal, with most pups nursing for only four days (Bowen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). Pups weigh an average of 48 kg at weaning, and on average double their birth mass in the short nursing period (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1997). The short reproductive period is energetically advantageous to both males and females, with relative losses in body mass being small for both sexes compared to other phocid Seals (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen and Kovacs 1999).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals moult in July, with each breeding stock congregating on sea ice north of their respective whelping areas. If mixing does occur, the degree to which it takes place is unknown. Following the moulting period they disperse in the North Atlantic (Folkow and Blix 1999, Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Apart from the breeding and moulting periods when Hooded Seals form loose aggregations in specific areas, they are thought to live quite solitary lives. However, little is known about them outside those periods. Groups of females and young animals have been seen at the northern ice edge in summer, but it is not known whether the groups are socially facilitated or solely the result of concentrations of prey. Hooded Seal longevity is 25-30 years (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are very capable divers that spend extensive periods at sea without hauling out (e.g., Folkow and Blix 1999, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Most of their dives are from 100-600 m in depth and last 5-25 minutes, however, very deep dives to over 1,000 m and dives lasting almost an hour have been recorded (Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data). Similar to Elephant Seals, Hooded Seals perform drift dives, in which buoyancy controls their movements through the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Hooded Seals feed on a wide variety of fish and invertebrates, including species that occur throughout the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Examples of typical prey are pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>sp.), Greenland Halibut, members of the Cod family such as Polar and Atlantic Cod, Redfishes, Sand Eels, Herring, Capelin, Squid (e.g., <em>Gonatus fabricii</em>), and Shrimp (Haug <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, 2007).<br/><br/>A recent study of foraging habitat selection by Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic documented significantly different preferences by adult males and females with the former occupying areas with complex seabed relief while the latter concentrated their foraging search effort along shelf areas (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Productivity (measured as chlorophyll a) was the most important single factor influencing habitat selection across all age groups.<br/><br/>Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known Hooded Seal predators (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). These predators are thought to be having increased impacts on Hooded Seals in the West Ice following the deterioration of breeding ice used by this species (Foote <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014); Greenland Sharks also take at least young Hooded Seals (Leclerc <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).","By-catch of Hooded Seals in coastal net fisheries has been reported from the USA, from trawl fisheries off Norway and Newfoundland, and from salmon drift nets used off Greenland (Woodley and Lavigne 1991, Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992, Waring <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). Competition for food with commercial fisheries and other predators has been suggested as a factor that may limit population growth or lead to declines of Hooded Seals (Reijnders <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). This factor may be playing a role in the continuing decline of Hooded Seals in the Northeast Atlantic given that abundance of Redfish, which are favoured prey of Hooded Seals, has declined in the late 1990s in both the Barents and Norwegian Seas due to excessive fishing pressure. No targeted catch is allowed for some Redfish species in this region and juvenile fish are being protected to attempt to promote recovery (ICES 2013b).<br/><br/>Impacts of oil spills on Hooded Seals have not been reported; however as an ice breeding species, they might be at risk of mortality from spills during the pupping season when newborn and newly weaned pups could be fouled (St. Aubin 1990). Hooded Seals have been exposed to <em>Morbillivirus </em>(Duignan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997), but are not known to have suffered fatalities during the mass die-offs of Harbour Seals in European waters from phocine distemper virus in 1998 and 2002. Subsequent testing revealed antibodies to the virus in 18-24% percent of the Hooded Seals sampled indicating exposure to the virus (Harkonen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Hooded Seals in the northeast Atlantic have high organohalogen contaminant burdens that are thought to be impacting thyroid homeostasis (Villanger <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Hooded Seal is a pack ice species, and is dependent on ice as a substrate for pupping, moulting, and resting and as such is vulnerable to reduction in extent or timing of pack ice formation and retreat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Johnston <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Learmonth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). The very short, intense breeding season of Hooded Seals that is timed right at the end of the sea ice season, has likely put them at heightened risk of impacts arising from changes in the duration of the sea ice season (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, 2012; Stenson and Hammill 2014). The Barents Sea region’s sea ice cover is declining at twice the rate of other arctic areas with a shortening of &gt;20 weeks having taken place in the last few decades (Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015), so it is not surprising that the West Ice stock is the first to be heavily impacted.<br/><br/>The productivity of the ice-edge ecosystem is also dependent on the dynamics and seasonality of arctic ice, and alterations to the cycle of formation and retreat of the ice could be having negative effects on important Hooded Seal prey. For example, Polar cod abundance has declined markedly in the last decade in the Barents Region within a broad, rapid “borealization” of the fish community in this sector of the Arctic (Fossheim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Decreases in sea ice cover could also lead to more shipping and development of extraction based industries in the Arctic (gas, oil, mining, etc.) which in turn could negatively affect Hooded Seals through increased exposure to contaminants and pollution, increased disturbance, and increased risk of shipping accidents and spills (Pagnan 2000).<br/><br/>Predation by Polar Bears is thought to be an increasing issue of concern with respect to the West Ice stock’s conservation status. Polar Bear diets have shown an increase in Hooded Seal consumption by 9.5% per decade since the mid-1980s in East Greenland along with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of Ringed Seals (McKinney <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). These changes are likely primarily due to changes in sea ice distribution and extent (but could also reflect a declining Ringed Seal population).","Hooded Seal populations are usually assessed based on aerial survey counts of pups at whelping areas in the pack ice, combined with population models to extrapolate to total population size. In Canadian waters, pup production estimates for the Front have been: 1978—26,000 (Winters and Bergflodt 1978); 1984—62,400 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987); 1985—61,400 (Hay <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1985); 1990—83,100 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); and 2005—107,013 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). These figures indicate an increase of 5.2%/year during 1978-2005, 2.6%/year during 1984-2005, and 1.7%/year during 1990-2005. Pup production estimates for Gulf region in Canada have been: 1991—2,006 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); 1998/99—2,000 (ICES 2001); and 2005—6,620 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). Comparing counts in 1991 and 2005 suggests that the number of animals in the Gulf increased by 8.5%/year during that period. Only two estimates are available for Davis Strait, 19,000 pups in 1984 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987) and 3,346 in 2005 (Hammill and Stenson 2006); this suggests a decline of 8.2%/year. Hammill and Stenson (2006, 2007) concluded that these estimates suggest a moderate increase both in pup production and population size between the mid 1980s and 2005 in the northwest Atlantic as a whole. Surveys carried out at all three whelping areas in 2005 produced an estimate of 116,900 pups born. The size of the whole population, modeled based on the pup counts, was estimated as 592,000 (Waring <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007). No more recent survey information is available for the northwest Atlantic breeding areas (ICES 2013a) and the down-turn in the number of animals in the Davis Strait in the 2005 survey is concerning, especially given its magnitude and the continued high hunting levels of this species in West Greenland.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals in the West Ice have shown, and continue to show, a declining trend. Pup production estimates have been: 1997—23,762 (ICES 2013a); 2005—15,250 (Salberg <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008); 2007—16,140 (ICES 2013a); and 2012—13,655 (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Comparing the estimates for 1997 and 2012 indicates a population decrease of 3.7%/year and a reduction in population size of 43% in 15 years (1.2 generations using the generation time of 12.8 years calculated by Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The most recent estimate of the total size of this population is 82,830 (SE=8,028) and models suggest a continued decline of approximately 7% per year in the coming decade (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is less than 10% of its abundance observed some 60 years ago (ICES 2013a). Overhunting was clearly involved in the collapse of this stock as quotas were being set for a population size much larger than it actually was. However, the cause of the significant, on-going decline in this population is thought to be related to climate change induced alternation of its sea ice breeding habitat and increased predation by Polar Bears and Killer Whales in the pupping areas (Øigard <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014) but prey availability might also be an issue.<br/><br/>Summing the most recent estimates for all stocks (three regions in the northwest Atlantic–2005; West Ice stock–2012) gives a total Hooded Seal population size estimate of approximately 675,000. However, with no recent surveys in Canada or Greenland this estimate cannot be considered reliable.<br/><br/>Available data show clearly that the Greenland Sea population has declined in recent years. With no surveys in the past 10 years, the trend for the northwestern stocks is unknown. Pup counts at the Front increased through until 2005, but with the rate of increase declining over time. With 15 years between surveys, it is possible that the population had peaked and started to decline before 2005. Since 2005, there have been several years with bad ice conditions when few Hooded Seals were sighted on the ice and it is not known whether any successful reproduction at all took place for the Gulf segment of the population (Stenson and Hammill 2014). Given the available data, the best estimate for the current population trend for Hooded Seals is -3.7%/year.<br/><br/>Because of their preference for heavy sea ice conditions for breeding, it is unlikely that Hooded Seals will continue to breed in their southern-most breeding areas in future. This species has been deemed one the most sensitive Arctic/subarctic marine mammal species to the impacts of climate change (Laidre <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Unknown,"Hooded Seals are found at high latitudes in the North Atlantic, and seasonally they extend their range north into the Arctic Ocean. They breed on pack ice and are associated with it much of the year, though they can spend significant periods of time pelagic, without hauling out (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Folkow and Blix 1999, Anderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Folkow <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kovacs <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011a). There are four major pupping areas: near the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, north of Newfoundland in an area known as the Front, in central Davis Strait, and in the West Ice in the Greenland Sea near the island of Jan Mayen (Sergeant 1974). Hooded Seals sometimes wander extensively; young animals have come ashore as far south as Portugal and the Canary Islands in Europe and south into the Caribbean in the West Atlantic (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986, Rice 1998). They have also been found outside the Atlantic Region, in the North Pacific and even as far south as California (Burns and Gavin 1980, Dudley 1992, Fay 1995). Since the mid 1990s, large numbers of vagrant Hooded Seals have been found outside the Arctic in some years (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2002, Harris and Gupta 2006). Stranded Hooded Seals are increasingly common on Sable Island, Canada, and along the New England coast and in the Saint Lawrence River area, particularly in years with sparse sea ice conditions (Harris <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lucas and Daoust 2002, Truchon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).","Hooded Seals were subjected to intense commercial hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries. Harvests were often conducted in association with Harp Seal harvests and commercial fisheries for Greenland Sharks. Norway, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Canada, and Greenland have all been involved in the commercial harvests of this species. Following World War II the hunt was primarily focused on pups because of their highly prized blue-back pelt, however, many adult females were taken while defending their pups until killing of mothers in the breeding areas was prohibited in the various areas (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).<br/><br/>The abundance estimate for Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic is now a decade old; the last survey was conducted in 2005 (ICES 2013a), and the stock is now treated as a data-poor stock in terms of management protocols. Total allowable catch was set at 8,200 in 2007 and remained unchanged through to 2015 despite the lack of new information on stock sizes or trends in the region. However, Canadian catches are reported to be very low, some few 10s of animals per year.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are also harvested in Greenland at a current level of a few thousand animals per year. It is assumed that most of those animals are from the northwest Atlantic breeding groups (Davis Strait, Gulf, and Front) given that most of the harvest takes place in West Greenland. However, some animals are also taken on the east coast of Greenland, and these animals are likely from the West Ice stock.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals have been harvested in the West Ice (Greenland Sea, north of Jan Mayen) for centuries. This hunt increased substantially after World War II, to levels that were clearly not sustainable. Regulatory measures were introduced in 1958 to reduce effort, and quotas were imposed in 1971 (Sergeant 1976, ICES 2006). Based on catch per unit effort analyses and mark-recapture pup production estimates it was assumed that the stock increased from the 1960s through to the 1990s at an unknown rate (Ulltang and Øien 1988). In hindsight this almost certainly was not the case (ICES 2013a). Aerial surveys in 1994 failed to produce an abundance estimate (Øritsland and Øien 1995). Recent modelling efforts suggest that a very substantial decrease in population abundance took place from the late 1940s up to the early 1980s (ICES 2006). This decline has continued through to the present and predictions suggest an ongoing decline of 7% over the coming decade (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Total pup production in this stock was estimated to be 24,000 in 1997 and this number dropped to 15,250 in 2005 (Salberg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and has continued to decline to 13,655 in 2012, despite a complete cessation of commercial harvesting (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous conservation measures, international management plans, harvest quotas, agreements, and treaties have been developed for the conservation of Hooded Seals dating back to the 1870s. Molting Seals in the Denmark Strait have been protected since 1961. Harvest quotas at Jan Mayen began in 1971. Hunting was banned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1972 and quotas were placed on the rest of the Canadian harvest beginning in 1974. A European Economic Community ban on importation on Seal products in 1985 reduced the harvest of blueback Hooded Seals through the loss of the primary market for the furs (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992). Greenlandic hunting is not limited, and might be at levels that are not sustainable, given deteriorating breeding conditions. The northeast Atlantic stock has experienced close to a 90% decline and the decline is ongoing. Population information for the northwest Atlantic is a decade old, leaving trends unknown for this segment of the population.<br/><br/>Based on population size, geographic range, habitat specificity, diet diversity, migration, site fidelity, sensitivity to changes in sea ice, sensitivity to changes in the trophic web, and maximum population growth potential Hooded Seals were rated to be among the top three arctic marine mammal species in terms of sensitivity to climate change (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008). This species should be re-evaluated as soon as new data are available for Canada and Greenland.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45225428,8010,Erignathus barbatus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, broad distribution, variable feeding habits, and no evidence of a current decline, the Bearded Seal are classified as Least Concern. However, Bearded Seals are very likely going to be negatively impacted by climate change, in particular because of losses of sea ice, and they should be monitored over the coming decades and reassessed as soon as more data become available.","<p>Bearded Seals are the largest northern phocid seal. Burns (1981) found that the average standard length of adults measured from the Bering/Chukchi region was 233 cm, with females slightly longer and substantially heavier than males. Maximum lengths were 233 cm for males and 243 cm for females and maximum weights were 262 kg and 360 kg. Newborn pups averaged 131 cm in length. Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) found an average asymptotic length of 219 cm for Bering/Chukchi samples from the 1970s, and 209 cm for samples from the 2000s. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) report a maximum weight of 432 kg for a female collected in the Bering Sea in spring 1985. The Atlantic Bearded Seal is of similar size, and shares the slight sexual dimorphism, with females tending to be larger than males (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Maximum mass recorded in Svalbard is for a female in spring that weighed 424 kg <br/> <br/> In Alaskan waters, sexual maturity is reached between 3 and 6 years in females, with an average of 4 years (Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Burns 1981). In Svalbard, females reach sexual maturity at an age of 5 years, while males are 6 years of age when they are sexually mature though it is likely some years from that point before they compete successfully to breed (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999). Final body size in Bearded Seals is reached at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958). Maximum longevity is likely 25-30 years (Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).</p><p>Bearded Seal pups are normally born on pack ice or small floes of annually-formed sea ice that fracture away from shore-fast ice as it breaks up in late spring (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). They also have been documented to use glacier ice pieces floating on the sea for birthing and nursing when forced to by the lack of availability of first-year sea ice (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The large, precocial pups swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2009). Peak birthing occurs between late March and mid-May, varying somewhat across the Bearded Seal’s range (Burns 1981, Kovacs 2009). Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2000) estimated that in Svalbard pups are weaned in approximately 24 days. Nursing might be somewhat shorter for the Pacific subspecies, Burns (1981) suggested that pups are weaned at 12-18 days of age. Prior to weaning, their aquatic skills develop to the degree that they spend about half their time in the water, diving for up to 5.5 minutes to depths of up to 84 m (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Mothers spend over 80% of their time in the water while caring for a dependent pup (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999); about half that time is spent away from the neonate, presumably in foraging dives. Females haul-out to nurse their pups on average three times a day. The small amount of time mothers spend out of the water when pups are young is thought to be an adaptive response to Polar Bear predation; when only the pup is on the surface, the pair is less conspicuous to hunting bears (Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Mating takes place at the end of lactation similar to other phocid seals. Males court females and display using elaborate downward trilling vocalizations that can travel many kilometres (Cleator <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989). Individual males use distinct songs, and occupy the same territories over a series of consecutive years within constraints imposed by variable ice conditions, or they show a roaming pattern (Van Parijs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, 2003, 2004). Males exhibit aggression with each other during breeding, including bubble-blowing and physical combat so the mating system is presumably polygynous to some degree.<br/><br/>Bearded seals have an extended moulting period and animals can be found shedding hair from April to August, though there appears to be a peak in May/June for both subspecies (Burns 1981, Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).&#160; During the moult they spend much of their time hauled out and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Bearded seals use sea ice as a haulout platform on a year-round basis whenever it is available, preferring small and medium sized floes and generally avoiding large floes (Simpkins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). However, they will haul out on land in the summer in the absence of sea ice (e.g., Burns 1981, Merkel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).&#160; They are rarely found more than a body length from access to water even if hauled out on land (Kovacs 2009).<br/><br/>Bearded Seals naturally occur at quite low densities (Bengtson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005); they are typically solitary animals, but they do form small, loose aggregations at times (Burns 1981). <br/><br/>Studies conducted on Atlantic Bearded Seal lactating females and pups (Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) have shown that diving depths largely reflect local bathymetry in coastal areas.&#160; This reflects their benthic foraging habits; Bearded Seals feed primarily on or near the bottom and most diving is to depths of less than 100 m (though dives of adults have been recorded up to 300 m and young-of-the-year have been recorded diving down to almost 500 m; Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). They use their elaborate whiskers to search for food items on and in soft bottom substrates and have powerful suction abilities to extract prey (Marshall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, 2008). The diet of Bearded Seals varies by age, location, and season (Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1980). Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadis saida</em>), Sculpins, Spider Crab, and Shrimps (<em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus </em>and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em>) are the most frequent prey items in Svalbard (Hjelset <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). However, Cod, other demersal fish, and worms are also regular components of the diet in this area. A wide variety of prey has been reported from the Okhotsk Sea, with Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, and Worms accounting for most of their diet (Burns 1981). Quakenbush <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2011) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of prey in 943 Bearded Seal stomachs collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1960-2009 and identified 213 different prey taxa. The most commonly eaten groups were Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, benthic and demersal fishes, and echiuroid worms. These authors found a significant increase in consumption of gadid fishes, principally Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Saffron Cod (<em>Eleginus gracilis</em>), from the 1960s to the 2000s.</p><p>Bearded Seals are preyed upon by Polar Bears, Killer Whales, Greenland Sharks, and Pacific Walruses (Lowry and Fay 1984, Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).</p>","Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2015; Kovacs 2011, 2012). In 2012, Bearded Seals were listed under the US Endangered Species Act following a detailed review of their status and threats (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) because of the threats posed from climate change induced losses in sea ice and ocean acidification due to climate warming, as well as increasing industrial activities in a more ice-free Arctic (Federal Register 2012). Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, that are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low to moderate threats to Bearded Seals.<br/><br/>Hunting by indigenous peoples continues throughout most of the species range. There is no evidence of any impact from hunting on Bearded Seal population numbers. For example, reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that Bearded Seal numbers have declined (Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).","Population sizes and trends are unknown for all populations of the Atlantic Bearded Seal (see Laidre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015 for a summary). An estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period, but this number is really an educated guess as opposed to an actual estimate and in any case is now dated. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada more recently assessed the status of this species in Canada as being data deficient (COSEWIC 2007). They are also listed on Greenland’s Red List as being data deficient (Boertmann 2007). There have never been any surveys for Bearded Seals in Norwegian waters (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006) or Russian territories in the Atlantic Arctic (Reijnders <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1993). However, recordings of their distinctive breeding calls via passive acoustic monitoring networks suggest that this species remains widespread and relatively numerous in the Atlantic Arctic (e.g., Moore <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Population data are also incomplete for Pacific Bearded Seals, but this subspecies has received considerably more survey effort. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) concluded that the best estimate for the Okhotsk Sea is 95,000 based on data from 1990 (Fedoseev 2000), and that there are no useful abundance estimates for the East Siberian and Beaufort Seas. Aerial surveys in 1999-2000 estimated about 27,000 Bearded Seals in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea. In the Bering Sea, surveys having been conducted by the USA and the Soviet Union/Russia starting in the 1970s. Early efforts, which covered varying areas and used a variety of methods, suggested an abundance of 50,000-100,000 Bearded Seals in the region. More recently, Ver Hoef <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2014) analyzed line transect survey data collected in the Bering Sea in spring 2007 using a series of models and estimated there were 61,800 Bearded Seals (95% CI 34,900–171,600) in their study area. Because that study included about half of the available sea ice habitat, Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) considered that the total Bearded Seal population in the Bering Sea was about 125,000. It is likely that the total abundance of Pacific Bearded Seals, including the Okhotsk Sea, is at least 250,000.<br/><br/>The global population size of Bearded Seals is unknown. Current population trends are also unknown.",Unknown,"Bearded Seals have a patchy circumpolar distribution throughout much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, south of 85ºN.&#160;In the Pacific sector they range from the Arctic Ocean south through the East Siberian, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas (Burns 1981).&#160;They also occupy all of Hudson Bay and much of the eastern Canadian Archipelago south to southern Labrador, and both coasts of Greenland. They occur along the north shore of Iceland, within the Svalbard Archipelago, in the drifting pack ice of the Barents Sea and across much of the north coast of the Russian Federation (Kovacs 2009). Bearded Seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Massachusetts&#160;(Gosselin and Boily 1994)&#160;in the North Atlantic, as well as in Japan and China in the North Pacific (Rice 1998).<br/> <br/> Bearded Seals are strongly associated with sea ice and are benthic feeders, and these two attributes explain much of their seasonal movement patterns and their general distribution. While they are not strictly migratory, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi region undergo seasonal movements linked with the advance and retreat of sea ice (Burns 1981, Cameron <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, in some other regions they are quite sedentary throughout the year, such as in Svalbard, Norway (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","<p></p><p>Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have hunted Bearded Seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today throughout much of the species’ range. However, levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. Subsistence harvests of Bearded Seals in Alaska were estimated to average approximately 6,800/year during 1990-1998 (Allen and Angliss 2010). Some animals are struck and lost, especially from late spring to mid summer when they are thinnest, and if those animals are accounted for the annual Alaska harvest could be as high as 10,000. An additional 1,000-2,000 may be taken by coastal hunters in Chukotka (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Subsistence harvest levels are not closely monitored in Canada, but Cleator (1996) estimated that roughly 2,400 Bearded Seals were taken per year. In Greenland Bearded Seals make up only 1-2% of the Seal catch (Garde 2013), with some few hundred taken annually. Bearded Seals are hunted at low levels in Svalbard currently, but during the whaling period individual boats would take hundreds. They are also harvested in the White Sea.<br/> <br/> The former Soviet Union historically conducted ship-based commercial harvests of Bearded Seals in the North Pacific region, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Okhotsk Seas. Harvests grew from 9,000 to 13,000 for the Bering and Okhotsk seas combined during 1957-1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year during 1964-1967 (Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Ship-based harvests were suspended from 1970 to 1975, and took place at lower levels when they resumed (Kelly 1988). There is currently no significant commercial harvest of Bearded Seals in Russia.</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits taking of Bearded Seals unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. In 2012, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi and Okhotsk Seas were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 2012). In Canada, subsistence hunting of Bearded Seals is co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and regional resource boards (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Licensed hunters can shoot Bearded Seals in Svalbard, outside protected areas and during open seasons, that are set in periods when Bearded Seals shot in the water are least likely to sink (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). In Russia, the “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Seals by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a total allowable catch is determined annually. Russia is the only nation to set a quota on the number of Bearded Seals that can be harvested, it is an “open” hunt in all other regions.<br/><br/>Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are increasingly important to them in areas where sea ice declines are marked (Lydersen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Tidal glacier fjords may represent important breeding refugias in the future as sea ice continues to decline and this habitat type should be considered for special conservation status.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Changes in juvenile survival and pup production suggest that some colonies may be approaching a resource ceiling. Grey Seals do not meet IUCN criteria for any threatened category and are listed as Least Concern.","Grey Seals are a large sexually dimorphic phocid. Northwest Atlantic Grey Seals are significantly larger than Northeast Atlantic animals. In the UK, adult males are on average 2 m long and weigh 233 kg, with a maximum of 310 kg. Adult females average 1.8 m and 155 kg. At birth, pups are 90-105 cm, with male pups averaging 15.8 kg in weight and female pups averaging 14.8 kg (Bonner 1981). Weaning weights average 40 kg for males and 35.8-39.6 kg for females. In the Western Atlantic adult males are on average 2.1 m long and weigh 267 kg, with a maximum of 370 kg (Bowen unpub. data). Adult females average 1.9 m in length and weigh 186 kg with a maximum of 256 kg (Iverson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). Newborn pups average 16.6 kg or about 14% of maternal body mass (Mellish <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). In North America, pups are heavier at birth than pups born in the UK and are 25% heavier at weaning. At the time of weaning, male pups average 56.2 kg and females 51.6 kg, as measured for pups born on the ice near Amet Island (Haller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996). Male pups weigh 56.6 and females weigh 54.5 kg for those born on land at Sable Island (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Baltic Grey Seal pups weigh about 12 kg at birth, but weaning mass differs between ice-born pups (48.3 kg) and those born on land (37.4 kg) (Jüssi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Survival to recruitment to the breeding population is positively related to pup size at weaning (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Lactation lasts around 15-18 days on average, with ice breeders having slightly shorter lactation periods; weaning is abrupt (Kovacs 1987, Haller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Pre-weaning mortality of Grey Seal pups varies widely between colonies; it is usually between 5 and 20% but can be as high as 30% (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Hammill <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Pup mortality rates are influenced by habitat quality, birth site, quality of maternal care, injuries resulting from male-male aggression, and to a lesser extent predation by Greater and Lesser Black-backed Gulls (<em>Larus marinus </em>and <em>L. fuscus</em>) on weakened, unprotected, pups, or pups born on the periphery of a colony (Baker and Baker 1988, Twiss <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>In the Baltic, pre-weaning mortality is low for pups born on ice, but varies between 5 and 30% on land, depending on pupping density (Jüssi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). The main predators in this region are White-tailed Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em>) and Greater Black-backed Gulls.<br/><br/>In the UK, females give birth on land and show considerable site fidelity (Pomeroy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994), although this is not observed elsewhere. Mothers typically stay with their pups until weaning (Boness and James 1979), but are rarely more than a few meters away from water at some UK colonies (Twiss <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Reproductive performance of adult females varies with age and body mass. Females in their late 20s and older show evidence of reduced reproductive success, caused by senescence (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of St Lawrence, lactating females that give birth on the ice spend about 72% of their time hauled out, nursing the pup every 2-3 hours. From the time of birth until weaning, females lose about 5.7 kg per day (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Females in the UK lose an average of 65 kg over the lactation period (Fedak and Anderson 1982), whereas the somewhat larger females in the Northwest Atlantic lose an average of 75 kg (Haller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Mellish <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Females come into estrus around the time of weaning (Boness <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982). Females are at their lowest weight following the moulting period, averaging 126.2 kg in Canadian colonies; by the beginning of the next pupping period they again average 210 kg (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003a).<br/><br/>Adult male Grey Seals come ashore about the time the first pups are born (Boness and James 1979, Bonner 1981). Their average age when first returning to their breeding colonies is 9-10 years at Sable Island (Manske <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Males spend large amounts of time out of the water fasting during the breeding season. Some males go to sea for periods of 2-3 days while others remain hauled out for the entire breeding season (Lidgard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Males do not defend a fixed territory, but stay near a particular group of females (Lidgard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Breeding age males lose less weight per day than lactating females, but because they are ashore for an average of 36 days, up to an extreme of 57days, they can experience considerable loss of mass (Anderson and Fedak 1985, Lidgard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Tinker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995).<br/><br/>Pupping dates differ significantly between populations: peak dates in the Northwest Atlantic are in January; in the Northeast Atlantic peak dates vary between September and December in different subpopulations; and in the Baltic Sea peak pupping is in late February to early March, which coincides with the annual maximum ice coverage. The differences in pupping seasons probably keep the groups reproductively isolated (Bonner 1981). Pups are born on land in the Northeast Atlantic, and can be born on either ice or land in the Northwest Atlantic and in the Baltic (Bonner 1981, Baker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995). Pups are born with a woolly white lanugo that is moulted around the time of weaning. Pups stay on land from birth until the moult is finished (Noren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008), although some pups on small exposed beaches often swim for short periods even before moulting (Kovacs 1987). During the post weaning fast pups lose up to 25% of their body mass (Noren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In the United Kingdom, adult females moult from mid-January to mid-February, and males moult from mid-February through early April. In Canada, the moult is later in the spring, with females moulting in May-June and males about a month later (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003a). Peak moulting season for Baltic seals is the last week of May to the second week in June.<br/><br/>Grey Seals are shallow, short-duration divers. Most adult diving is shallower than 120 m and shorter than 8 min. (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003b). Female’s dives are on average slightly longer (5.5 min.) than those of males (4.9 min.), although males tend to dive somewhat deeper (57 m compared to 49 m) (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003b). On the Scotian Shelf, maximum dives recorded were 412 m for males, and 354 m for females (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003b). Typically in the UK, dives are shorter and shallower (average 4-10 min., maximum 30 min.). In European waters Grey Seals are primarily demersal feeders, diving to the seabed during most dives (usually 60 m, but down to 200 m in some areas; Thompson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1991).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are not long-distance migrants. In Europe, tracking of individual seals has shown that they can feed up to several hundred kilometres offshore during short foraging trips lasting 2.3 days on average (McConnell <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Individual Grey Seals, based at specific haulout sites, often make repeated trips to the same region offshore but will occasionally move to a new haulout and begin foraging in a new region. Movements of Grey Seals between haul-outs in the North Sea and the Shetland Isles, Outer Hebrides, and Faeroe Islands have been recorded. During foraging trips Grey Seals often target areas with fine gravel/coarse sandy sea-bed sediments, which are the preferred habitat of Sandeels (<em>Ammodytes </em>sp.), an important part of the Grey Seal’s diet.<br/><br/>Satellite telemetry data from Canada show that Grey Seals there perform much longer foraging trips (averaging 5-12 days) and often travel much larger distances than European Grey Seals (Breed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Foraging trip characteristics differ seasonally and by sex. Females typically fed closer to haulouts than males and spent more time foraging at these patches (Breed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Grey Seals in Canada also exhibit pronounced seasonal sex segregation in foraging distribution (Breed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). In the Baltic Sea, Grey Seals make short feeding trips, spending roughly 75% of their time within 50 km of haulout sites (Sjøberg and Ball 2000).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are generalist predators, consuming a wide range of species, although typically fewer than 10 species comprise most of the diet (Bowen and Siniff 1999). Grey Seal diet varies by seasonally and location, though they are largely demersal or benthic feeders (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993, Hall 2002). At times in Canada and the North Sea, the food consumed by Grey Seals can be over 50% Sandeels, although several dozen species are eaten (Bowen and Harrison 1994, Hammond <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994, Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). In Iceland, where 15 species make up the majority of the diet, the most common stomach contents by weight are Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) 24%, Sandeels 23%, Catfish (Wolf-fish <em>Anarhichas lupus</em>) 15%, and Saithe (<em>Pollachius virens</em>) 11% (Hauksson and Bogason 1997). At the Faroes, adults feed on Cod and Catfish, subadults feed on Sandeels and Saithe, and juveniles consume Sandeels (Mikkelsen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). In the United Kingdom, Sandeels, Cod, and Dover Sole (<em>Solea solea</em>) account for 56% of the diet by weight. Grey Seals also eat other flatfish, including Dab (<em>Limanda limanda</em>), Flounder (<em>Platichthys plessus</em>), and Plaice (<em>Pleuronectes platessa</em>) (Prime and Hammond 1990). In the Outer Hebrides, gadids account for 40% or more of the diet (Ling, Molva molva), Atlantic Cod, and Whiting (<em>Merlangius merlangus</em>); Sandeels are less important in this area (Hammond <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). In Canada, the dominant prey species consumed by Seals differs by season, sex, and age-class; however, Sandeels and Redfish (<em>Sebastes </em>sp.) together accounted for 40-91% of the diet in all seasons, sexes, and age-classes (Bowen and Harrison 1994). Pollock (<em>Pollachius virens</em>), and flounders (Turbot <em>Reinhardtius</em> <em>hippoglossoides</em>, Witch <em>Glyptocephalus cynoglossus</em>, and Yellowtail <em>Limanda ferruginea</em>) account for more than 10% of the diet in some demographic groups within seasons (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). Atlantic Cod can be an important part of the diet in some areas and seasons (Hammill <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. They have been hunted in the Baltic Sea for more than 10,000 years (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Commercial harvesting has been ongoing in many areas for hundreds of years, and at times Grey Seals have been important to local economies (Mansfield 1988). Over-harvesting in the Baltic in the early 20th century led to a large decline; this population once numbered somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000, but was reduced to about 20,000 in the 1940s. A further decline to 1,500-2,000 seals was caused by high loads of PCB (Harding and Härkönen 1999).<br/><br/>Government culls, bounties and licensed kills for protection of fishing gear have been put into effect in many countries and continue to be used to control Grey Seal numbers and reduce their impact on commercially important coastal fisheries (i.e., salmonid fisheries). Grey Seals feed on a number of commercial species, and by damaging nets and traps they are in direct conflict with fisheries. They also are vectors for parasites that can have an impact on the economics of some fisheries (ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Entanglement in commercial fishing nets causes by-catch mortality in most parts of the Grey Seals’ range (Woodley and Lavigne 1991). By-catch levels are approximately 300 per year in Swedish fisheries in the Baltic (ICES 2005). A Norwegian study from 1975-1998 reported the death of 259 seals, primarily juveniles less than a year old, which represented 7% of the tagged animals in the region (Bjørge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). Among 528 deaths of tagged seals in the UK, 148 were attributable to fishing nets. However, this may overestimate the rate of entanglement-related mortality due to the high rate of tag returns from fisheries. Woodley and Lavigne (1991) suggested that 1-2% of animals less than a year old die in fishing gear. More recent photographic analysis of Grey Seals at haulout sites on Cape Cod, Massachusetts revealed 5-8% of Seals exhibited signs of entanglement (Sette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Finally, in the US commercial fisheries there was an average annual mortality of 853 Grey Seals reported for the period 2006-2010 (Waring <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). For the period 2008-2012, the total estimated human caused mortality (and serious injury to) Grey Seals was 4,533 per year of which about 1,000 were taken in US observed fisheries, about 400 in the Canadian hunt, 90 taken by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in scientific collections, and about 3,000 were killings of nuisance animals in Canada (DFO 2011).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are known carriers of phocine distemper virus (PDV), in all populations (Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992, Duignan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). However, they have suffered almost no mortality from the disease, in marked contrast to Harbour Seals. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2006) report Grey Seal mortality of approximately 230 (equal to 1% of the Harbour Seal mortality) in the 1988 epizootic in Europe and the death of 30 Grey Seal pups in the Baltic were attributed to PDV. Because Grey Seals haulout with Harbour Seals in the Wadden Sea and are known to travel more widely than the more sedentary Harbour Seal, it is presumed that they had a role in the outbreak and spread of the 2002 epizootic of PDV in Harbour Seals (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are exposed to agricultural pollutants through the food chain in their coastal ranges. PCBs and DDT contaminant loads are extremely high in Baltic Grey Seals, despite the fact that tissue burdens have declined since the 1970s. Analysis of samples collected from 1996 to 1998 indicated that Grey Seals still have a very heavy load of contaminants when compared to other Seals outside the Baltic (ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Health effects on Grey Seals have been suggested to be linked to their high exposures to PCBs and DDT. Baltic Grey Seals have a relatively high rate of colonic ulcers associated with hookworm infestations, which are sometimes fatal. This condition is not found elsewhere (ICES 2005). Uterine stenosis and a host of other pathologies in other organs have been attributed to long-term exposure to environmental toxics, particularly in older Baltic Grey Seals. These are specifically linked to reproductive and population declines for this subspecies and are conditions not seen in other populations (Bergman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). However, no negative effects have been attributed to heavy metal contaminants in Baltic Grey Seals (Bergman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Grey Seals live close to human population centres and shipping lanes and spend much of their time in the vicinity of favourite haulout locations. Spilled oil from vessel accidents and other sources have fouled Grey Seal sites since at least the 1940s (St. Aubin 1990). Despite numerous records of oiled animals and occasional reports of dead animals coated in oil, or animals having ingested oil, it has not been determined whether those mortalities are attributable to contact with oil (St. Aubin 1990).","Available data on Grey Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the two recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, were as follows: Northeast Atlantic Grey Seal 66,000, increasing; Northwest Atlantic Grey Seal 250,000, increasing. The world-wide population of Grey Seals is estimated to contain about 316,000 mature individuals and the total population size is about 632,000.",Increasing,"Grey Seals have a cold temperate to sub-Arctic distribution in North Atlantic waters over the continental shelf (Hall 2002). There are three populations isolated both geographically and by the timing of reproduction (Bonner 1981); mtDNA differences are large between these three breeding areas, though the Baltic and Northeast Atlantic populations are much closer to one another than to the Northwest Atlantic population (Boskovic <em>et al</em>. 1996). In the western Atlantic, the population is centered on the eastern Scotian Shelf off northeastern North America, but the Grey Seal ranges from the Gulf of Maine to southern Labrador, including the Gulf of St Lawrence (Lesage and Hammill 2001). The northeast Atlantic population is concentrated around the UK and Ireland but is also found around Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and along the European mainland coast from the Kola Peninsula south to southern Norway, and from Denmark to Brittany in France. The Baltic Sea subpopulation is confined to the Baltic Sea (Bonner 1981, Hall 2002). Vagrants are known from as far south as New Jersey in the western Atlantic and Portugal in the eastern Atlantic (Rice 1998).","Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. Grey Seals are protected in the USA under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and in Canada under the Fisheries Act. Nevertheless, there is a management plan that permits commercial harvesting of Grey Seals in Canadian waters, although relatively few Seals are taken each year. Grey Seal pups were taken in Orkney until the early 1980s, partly for commercial exploitation and partly as a population control measure. Large-scale culls of Grey Seals in the North Sea, Orkney, and Hebrides were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s as population control measures.<br/><br/>In Norway, hunting quotas are set within the context of a Grey Seal management plan and bounties have also been paid to reduce numbers in areas where there are conflicts with fisheries (Nilssen and Haug 2007). Hunting of Grey Seals is also permitted in Iceland (Hauksson 2007). In the Faroe Islands, licenses to kill Grey Seals are issued for the purpose of protecting marine fish farming (Mikkelsen 2007).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous countries have invoked protective measures to limit Grey Seal harvests, culls, disturbance, and by-catch (Bonner 1981, ICES 2005). Pollutant loads in Baltic Grey Seals have declined following regulations banning the use and discharge of toxic pollutants such as DDT and PCBs beginning in the 1970s. Although the prevalence of colonic ulcers has increased over the last decades, the reproductive health of female Grey Seals has improved as has the population level in the Baltic (Bergman <em>et al</em>. 2001). Establishment of coastal marine reserves for Seals in Norway have been more effective in protecting Harbour Seals than Grey Seals because the latter are more likely to travel outside the areas closed to fisheries and become entangled in nets (Bjørge <em>et al</em>. 2002).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45229114,17013,Phoca vitulina,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Harbor Seals are distributed very widely and their total population size is estimated at about 600,000. Trend in abundance is unknown for four of the subspecies; the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is known to be increasing. While in many areas Harbor Seals share the coastal zone with increasing human populations and suffer some impacts as a result, current threats appear to be tolerable and/or manageable. As a species, the Harbor Seal does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is listed as Least Concern. However, the subspecies <em>Phoca vitulina mellonae</em>, the Ungava Seal, is listed separately as Endangered.","Harbor Seals live mostly in the coastal waters of the continental shelf and slope, and are commonly found in bays, rivers, estuaries, and intertidal areas. They also occur in some lakes (Burns 2009). They will haul out on rocks, sand and shingle beaches, sand bars, mud flats, vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice and a variety of man-made structures. They usually lie close to the water to permit a rapid escape from threats. Sex and age segregation is common in most populations (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). They are usually extremely wary and shy on land and therefore it is almost impossible to approach them when they are hauled out without stampeding them into the water. However, habituation to human activities in their vicinity can occur. Most haul-out sites are used daily, based on tidal cycles and other environmental variables, although foraging trips can last for several days (Grellier <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Although Harbor Seals are considered a non-migratory species with a high degree of site fidelity to a haul out, long-distance dispersal of juveniles, emigration, and establishment of new haul out sites do occur (Ries <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Bjorge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is also evidence of seasonal changes in at-sea distribution and home range size by age class and sex (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Dietz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Adult male Harbor Seals are 1.6-1.9 m long and weigh 70-150 kg, adult females are 1.5-1.7 m and 60-110 kg. At birth, pups are 82-98 cm and 8-12 kg (Burns 2009). Males become sexually mature when four to six years old. Female Harbor Seals usually become sexually mature when three to five years old (Harkonen and Heide-Jorgensen 1990). Throughout the Harbor Seal's range, the time of birthing varies widely and may follow a latitudinal cline (Temte 1994). Peak pupping date varies from mid March to early September. The mating system is promiscuous, or weakly polygynous, with males defending underwater calling sites (Boness <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Van Parijs and Kovacs 2002). Mating usually takes place in the water, with females coming into oestrus about a month after giving birth. Molt follows the pupping and mating season. The timing of onset of molt depends on the age and sex of the animal with yearlings molting first and adult males last (Reder <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). <br/><br/>Females give birth to a single precocial pup. Most pups shed their silvery gray lanugo coat in the uterus before birth and are born with a juvenile pelage. Exceptions to this include pups born prematurely, and some that are born early in the breeding season (Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994). Pups usually enter the water soon after birth, and because of tidal inundation at many sites used for birthing, this often occurs within hours (Burns 2009). Pups are suckled for an average of 26 days (Drescher 1979). Unlike Grey Seals, Harbor Seal females need to feed during the lactation period to produce adequate milk for their rapidly growing pup, and as a result they undertake regular feeding trips to sea (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001).<br/><br/>At sea, Harbor Seals are most often seen alone, but they occasionally occur in small groups. Localized aggregations can form in response to feeding opportunities and concentration of prey. Harbor Seals are generalist feeders that take a wide variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans obtained from surface, mid-water, and benthic habitats (e.g., Pitcher 1980, Harkonen 1987, Olesiuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Pierce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991). Their diet is highly varied, and animals from different populations and areas show differences, and there is also variation associated with seasonal and interannual changes in the abundance of prey (e.g., Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996). Generally, a few species dominate the diet at any one location and time of year. They are primarily a coastal species with dive depths generally less than 100 m (Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998), but dives to as much as 480 m have been recorded in Alaska (Frost <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). <br/><br/>Longevity is about 30-35 years with females living longer than males. Known predators include Killer Whales, Great White and Greenland Sharks, and possibly other Shark species, Steller Sea Lions, Walrus, Eagles, Gulls, and Ravens (Burns 2009).","Historically, there have been organized population reduction programs and bounty schemes for Harbor Seals in some range states, largely because of perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting and/or licensed killing to protect fisheries has largely been eliminated but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives is allowed in the US. In the eastern Atlantic, Harbor Seal population reduction programs date from the early 1980s and 1990s in Iceland and Scotland, respectively (Bowen and Lidgard 2012) and continue at some level today (e.g., Butler <em>et al.</em> 2008). An extermination program at the beginning of the 20th century dramatically depleted Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea. Quotas for Harbor Seals are set annually in Norway and a bounty is paid to hunters in several regions of the country.<br/><br/>Mass die-offs from viral outbreaks have killed thousands of Harbor Seals on both sides of the Atlantic, but most notably in Europe caused by phocine distemper virus (Dietz <em>et al.</em> 1989, Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Reijnders 1986). Because Harbor Seals haul out on nearshore and coastal mainland sites, they are exposed to terrestrial wild carnivores, pets and feral animals, and waste from human populations that create an increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases. <br/><br/>Because many Harbor Seals live and feed in close proximity to large populations of humans they are exposed to, and can accumulate, high levels of industrial and agricultural pollutants (e.g., organochlorines, PCBs, dioxins) that negatively affect reproduction (Reijnders 1986), induce vitamin deficiency (Brouwer <em>et al.</em> 1989), and cause immunosuppression (Ross <em>et al.</em> 1995). Both chronic oil spills and discharges and episodic large-scale spills can cause direct mortality (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999; Hoover-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2001) and could have long term impacts on Harbor Seal health and their environment. <br/><br/>Noise and other disturbance from offshore oil and gas, and the development of offshore renewable energy such as wind farms, may also affect the foraging behavior and physical condition of Harbor Seals (Hastie <em>et al.</em> 2015, Skeate <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Harbor Seals live in coastal areas many of which are heavily fished and this results in entanglement and bycatch issues (see Desportes <em>et al.</em> 2010) Overfishing and environmental variability (including global climate change) may also impact Harbor Seal prey populations.","Available data on Harbor Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies.<br/>Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal--65,000, trend unknown</li><li>Western Atlantic Harbor Seal--60,000, trend unknown</li><li>Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal--170,000, increasing</li><li>Kuril Seal--&lt;10,000, trend unknown</li><li>Ungava Seal--50, trend unknown</li></ul>Combining those estimates, the total number of mature Harbor Seals worldwide is about 315,000. Bjorge <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated the total worldwide population of Harbor Seals as approximately 610,000-640,000. The overall trend in numbers is unknown.",Unknown,"Harbor Seals are one of the most widespread of the pinnipeds. They are found throughout coastal waters of the northern hemisphere, from temperate to polar regions. Five subspecies are recognized:&#160;the Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Brittany to the Barents Sea in northwestern Russia and north to Svalbard, with occasional sightings as far south as northern Portugal,&#160;the Western Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the western Atlantic from the mid-Atlantic United States to the Canadian Arctic and east to Greenland and Iceland,&#160;the Ungava Seal&#160;only lives in a few lakes and rivers in northern Quebec, Canada, that drain into Hudson and James Bays,&#160;the&#160;Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal&#160;is found in the eastern Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to the end of the Alaskan Peninsula and possibly to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and&#160;the Kuril Seal&#160;ranges from either the end of the Alaskan Peninsula or the eastern Aleutians to the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, and through the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido (Rice 1998).","Harbor Seals were commercially harvested in British Columbia, and commercial and recreational use also occurred in Alaska. All commercial harvesting ceased several decades ago. Harbor Seals were protected in Canada in 1970 by the Fisheries Act. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 provided a broad prohibition on taking of any marine mammal. However, Alaska Natives are allowed to harvest Harbor Seals for subsistence and creation of authentic handicrafts, and Native handicrafts and edible portions may be sold in Native villages and towns. Some subsistence harvesting still occurs in Alaska, as well as in Canada and Greenland. In Russia, Kuril Seals are listed in the Red Data Book and there is no legal harvest.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Harbor seals at Svalbard are protected under the Norwegian National Red List. Hunting of Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea was prohibited in 1970 and management of this species in the Baltic Sea and Southern Scandinavian waters is the responsibility of HELCOM. Denmark and Sweden have established Harbor Seal sanctuaries. Neighboring states of the Wadden Sea have signed a trilateral agreement for the management of Harbor Seals. Since 1994, Harbor Seals have been considered vulnerable on the French national Red List. In the United Kingdom, Harbor Seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and the Marine Scotland Act.<br/><br/>In the United States the Harbor Seal is protected from all but Alaska Native subsistence hunting by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also prohibits importation of parts or products from all seals. In Canada, the management of Seals is regulated within the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans though the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations of 1993. Ungava Seals are being considered for designation as “Endangered” by COSEWIC and are listed as “Schedule 3, Special Concern” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

45229806,17023,Phoca largha,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The Spotted Seal is an abundant species and there is no evidence of recent declines in the main part of its range. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.<br/><br/><em></em>,"In the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, adult female Spotted Seals usually weigh 65-115 kg and are 151-169 cm long, while adult males weigh 85-110 kg and are 161-176 cm long (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Maximum reported length was 182 cm for females and 185 cm for males (Tikhomirov 1968).<br/><br/>In spring, Spotted Seals give birth to a single pup, typically on the surface of sea ice but in some places on shore, particularly in the Bohai Sea, Peter the Great Bay, the South Kuril Islands, the second Kuril Strait, Utashud Island, and the east coast of Kamchatka (Trukhin 2005). Pups are born in a white lanugo coat that is shed at or before weaning, which occurs about four weeks after birth. At birth pups are 75-92 cm long and weigh 7-12 kg, and they grow to 30 kg or more by weaning (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Mating occurs after pups are weaned. Spotted Seals are annually monogamous and males defend lactating females on ice floes. Groups composed of a female with her pup and a male, called triads, are common during the breeding season (Quakenbush 1988).<br/><br/>In late-spring and summer many Spotted Seals leave the sea ice and haul out on land to rest when they are not foraging. On some haul-out sites in Kamchatka the number of animals on shore may exceed 10,000 individuals (V. Burkanov pers. comm.). As sea ice forms in October-November Spotted Seals again use the ice as their primary feeding and resting habitat (Burkanov 1990; Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, 2000). They are generalist feeders that take primarily a variety of fish species (Walleye Pollock, Arctic and Saffron Cod, Rockfish, Herring, Sand Lance, Smelt, Capelin, Eelpout, Salmon, Flatfishes), cephalopods (Squid and Octopus) and crustaceans (Shrimp and Crab) (Burkanov 1990, Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Reported predators include Pacific Sleeper Sharks, Killer Whales, Golden Eagles, Steller’s Sea Eagles, Ravens, Gulls, Polar and Brown Bears, Wolves, Arctic Foxes, Walruses and Steller Sea Lions (Quakenbush 1988).","Intensive harvesting of fish in the Okhotsk and Bering seas poses a risk to Spotted Seals, as several of their main prey species are targets of commercial fisheries (Lowry and Frost 1985). Entanglement in commercial fisheries occurs occasionally in Japan and in the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea. Small, organized control kills to limit damage to fisheries regularly occur in Japan (Mizuno <em>et al.</em> 2001, Angliss and Outlaw 2007). In Kamchatka, Spotted Seals sometimes eat fish out of fishing gear and fishermen shoot small numbers in local areas to defend their landings and protect their equipment (V. Burkanov, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Oil and gas development may cause disturbance to and adversely affect the habitat used by Spotted Seals (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to their populations, but the closely related North Pacific Harbor Seal was impacted by oil spilled from the tanker <em>Exxon Valdez</em> (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1994). The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season, if food resources were negatively affected, or if the spill was an event that affected a large area (St. Aubin 1990). A variety of contaminants have been found in Spotted Seals sampled in Alaska but their potential impacts are largely unknown (Quakenbush<em> et al</em>. 2009). Contaminant concerns would be greatest for animals living in the western part of the range where they occur near large population and industrial areas in China, Korea, and Japan.<br/><br/>Reduction in late winter and spring sea ice cover as a result of the disrupted, warming climate could be problematic for Spotted Seals as the majority of the population uses pack ice at the southern limit of the ice extent for pupping (e.g., Tynan and DeMaster 1997). Changes to ice characteristics that affect its location, timing, stability, etc. could result in lower survival of Spotted Seal pups. This threat is strongest in the southern parts of the range, the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, where ice extent and seasonal persistence time have already been greatly reduced (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009). The threat may be mitigated somewhat in the Bering Sea, where a long-term range shift northward would be possible through Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, where seasonal formation of suitable ice is projected to occur beyond the current century under the most commonly used global climate models (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009). Disruption or alteration of the patterns of primary productivity and abundance of key prey species, either by sea ice loss or ocean acidification could also have detrimental effects on Spotted Seals, though the magnitude and even the direction of impacts are very uncertain (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).","The abundance of Spotted Seals has never been well quantified. Poorly documented estimates suggest a total population size in the 1970s of perhaps 400,000, with 200-250,000 in the Bering-Chukchi Seas and perhaps 170,000 in the Okhotsk Sea (Bigg 1981, Quakenbush 1988). More recent surveys indicate the total number may be in excess of 640,000 individuals, with more than 460,000 in the Bering Sea (Conn <em>et al</em>. 2014), 180,000 in the Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2000), and about 3,300 in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan (Han <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nesterenko and Katin 2009). Surveys have been too irregular and imprecise to measure population trend, but Alaska Native hunters have not reported any notable changes in the availability of Spotted Seals (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009, Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Maximum longevity is at least 35 years (Quakenbush 1988). Less than a third of females and males become sexually mature by age 3, about two-thirds of both sexes become mature by age 4, and nearly all (i.e., &gt;90%) are sexually mature by age 5 (Tikhomirov 1966, Naito and Nishiwaki 1972, Fedoseev 2000, Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009).",Unknown,"Spotted Seals breed in the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohia Sea. They are also found outside the breeding season in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, ranging north into the Arctic Ocean to about the edge of the continental shelf, west to about 170°E longitude, and east to the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada (Shaughnessey and Fay 1977, Quakenbush 1988). They inhabit the southern edge of the pack ice from winter to early summer. In late summer and fall, Spotted Seals move into coastal areas, including river mouths. They rarely occur in water depths greater than 200 m (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2000). They breed mostly on sea ice and haul-out on sea ice when it is available, but they also haul out on beaches and sandbars (Burns 1970; Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2000). There are several sites along the Asian coast where Spotted Seals breed on small remote islands (e.g., in Peter the Great Gulf, the Kuril Islands, and small islands along east coast of Kamchatka; Burkanov 1988, 1990; Trukhin and Katin 2001; Kostenko <em>et al</em>. 2004; Vertyankin and Nikulin 2004).","Alaska Natives are allowed to take marine mammals for subsistence and creation of handicrafts. Subsistence hunting of Spotted Seals has no doubt occurred since humans first made contact with the species and they remain an important subsistence resource for coastal Alaska Natives in western Alaska (Quakenbush 1988, Allen and Angliss 2014). From the 1960s through the 1980s, the Soviet Union harvested several thousand Spotted Seals each year in both the Okhotsk and Bering seas, mostly from large commercial vessels (Heptner 1996). Commercial harvesting of this species no longer occurs in Russia.",Terrestrial|Marine,"In the United States the Spotted Seal is generally protected from all but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also generally prohibits import and export of parts or products from all marine mammals.<br/><br/>Commercial harvesting of Spotted Seals from vessels of the Russian Federation ended in 1994. Small scale commercial and subsistence harvests from small boats and land occurs along the Russian Far East coast, but the size of the harvest is relatively small (V. Burkanov pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Spotted Seals are listed in the Second Category (II) of the State Key Protected Wildlife List in China, listed as Vulnerable in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, and designated a vulnerable species under the Wildlife Conservation Act of China (Wang 1998). However, as of 2004, no “conservation action, public awareness or education programmes have been carried out for the species in this region” (Won and Yoo 2004).<br/><br/>In 2000, Spotted Seals were afforded protected status under the Wildlife Conservation Act of South Korea.

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;Härkönen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231087,41671,Pagophilus groenlandicus,Least Concern,,2015,2015-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, and the increasing trend in two of three major population groups, the Harp Seal should continue to be classified by IUCN as Least Concern. However, climate change poses a serious threat to this ice-associated species and Harp Seals should be reassessed within a decade. Reductions in pup production and declines in body condition have recently been documented in the Northeast Atlantic breeding groups that are thought to be due to environmental change linked to warmer water and less sea ice.","Harp Seals are medium-sized phocids. Adult males and females are similar in size, about 1.8 m long and weighing about 130 kg. Females reach sexual maturity between four and eight years of age (e.g., Frie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), and this has varied considerably over the last century, in part as a consequence of population size that has been largely determined by harvest levels and food availability. Males probably do not participate in breeding until they are somewhat older, though they reach physiological maturity around the same time as females. <br/><br/>Birthing takes place in vast herds from late February to April. There is some variation across the range in the precise timing but herds are highly synchronized (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Pups are born on the open, free-floating, pack ice and nursed for 12 days, during which time they gain weight at about 2.2 kg per day (Kovacs and Lavigne 1985, Kovacs 1987, Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991, Lydersen and Kovacs 1996). To minimize energy expenditure, most pups are sedentary for the first month; some are so immobile that they melt into the ice beneath them, forming ice “cradles” (Kovacs 1987). Pups are referred to as “whitecoats” because they are born with an insulating coat of white lanugo. Lactating females spend up to 85% of their time in the water, depending on the weather (Lydersen and Kovacs 1993). Towards the end of lactation, females come into oestrus and mate (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Weaned pups remain on the ice for up to six weeks, losing up to 50% of their weight before entering the water to feed. During this post-weaning fast they complete moulting of the lanugo. After this coat is shed, the black and silver-gray pelage is exposed and the juveniles are known as “beaters” until they are about a year old. <br/><br/>Gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a three to four month period of delayed implantation (Stewart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989). The maximum life span of a Harp Seal is approximately 30 years; most animals that reach sexual maturity live to over 20 years. Both males and females are sexually active until the ends of their lives, showing no reproductive senescence (Ronald and Healey 1981). <br/><br/>Harp Seals older than pups undergo a moult in the post-breeding months, from early April to early May (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Harp Seals are highly migratory, and after breeding Canadian Seals follow the pack ice up the coast of Labrador, with small numbers going into Hudson Bay and around Baffin Island, and the rest travelling up both sides of Davis Strait. The Jan Mayen and White Sea groups migrate northward and mix in the Barents Sea (Folkow <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). The Canadian Seals also spend the summer months in the Arctic; their round-trip migration is over 5,000 km long (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). They begin the return trip to their breeding grounds (either the Gulf or the Front) in late autumn. <br/><br/>Harp Seals consume a wide range of prey that varies along their migration routes. Their recorded diet includes 67 species of fish and 70 species of invertebrates (Lavigne 2002). Pups and juveniles take a lot of invertebrate prey, especially Euphausiids (<em>Thyanoessa </em>spp.) and pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>spp.; Haug <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Nilssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Adults in Greenland eat pelagic crustaceans, and fish such as Capelin (<em>Mallotus villosus</em>), Sandeel (<em>Ammodytes</em> sp.), Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Arctic Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>). Commercial species such as Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) appear to be of minor importance in the diet (Kapel 2000), largely because Harp Seals of all ages eat relatively small prey and tend to specialize somewhat on polar species such as Polar Cod and Capelin (Lindstrom <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In the Barents Sea, Harp Seals eat Amphipods, Shrimps and small fish including Polar Cod, Sculpin (<em>Cottidae</em>), Snailfish (<em>Liparidae</em>) and Capelin (Nilssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995); but they show a clear preference for large Polar Cod (Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Lindstrom <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The Seals off Newfoundland eat Capelin and Arctic Cod, and off Labrador they eat Arctic Cod and Atlantic Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>). In the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Seals consume Capelin, Herring, Atlantic Cod, Arctic Cod and Redfish (<em>Sebastes </em>sp.; Lawson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Harp Seals feed heavily in winter and summer and less in spring and autumn. They are a highly social species that travels and forages in groups, yet they maintain a stratification of diet according to age class and depth of the feeding dives. <br/><br/>Harp Seals are relatively shallow divers. Animals satellite-tagged at Jan Mayen stayed close to the edge of the pack ice during the spring moult, usually diving to less than 100 m, but by July tagged Seals in the Barents Sea dove to 400 m. Overall, the deepest dives occurred during the day in winter (Folkow <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).<br/><br/>Natural predators of Harp Seals include Polar Bears, Killer Whales and Greenland Sharks (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In Svalbard, 13% of Polar Bear prey is comprised of Harp Seals (Derocher <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002).","As noted earlier, Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years but currently the population is large and the number of animals harvested is declining.<br/><br/>Reduced availability of potential prey, especially Polar Cod, Capelin and Herring, is a threat to Harp Seals. Several Harp Seal “invasions” took place in recent decades along the north coast of Norway. By-catch mortality in nets during those events was estimated to be as high as 100,000 animals in 1987 and 21,474 in 1988 (Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991). The reason for these emigrations out of their normal range within the Barents and Greenland Seas seems to have been a collapse of Herring and Capelin stocks due to a combination of overfishing and shifting oceanographic conditions (low temperatures and salinity, and extensive ice cover; Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991, Woodley and Lavigne 1991). More recently, declining Krill abundance has been correlated with declines in both pup production and body condition of Harp Seals in the Barents Sea region, which are likely related to reductions in sea ice in this area (Øigård <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>A small tourist industry that visits the whelping patches in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is not thought to pose any risk to the Seals; it uses a rotational mode of operation such that individual Seals are not visited repeatedly (Kovacs and Innes 1990). <br/><br/>Oil spills in the Northwest Atlantic off the east coast of Canada remain a threat to Seals. There is a concern about the impacts of tanker traffic, particularly in places like Lancaster Sound in the eastern Canadian Arctic, which is an important Harp Seal summering area (Reijinders <em>et al.</em> 1993). The discharge from a ruptured tank on the shore of New Brunswick, Canada in March–April 1969 led to 10,000 to 15,000 Seals being heavily coated with oil. The high number of dead pups washing ashore after this event was evidence of the lethal effects of the oil (St. Aubin 1990). Oil development in the Barents Sea is ongoing and poses a future threat to Harp Seals in the White Sea and West Ice stocks. <br/><br/>Harp Seals have been found to carry significant loads of contaminants including metals, DDT and PCBs (Ronald <em>et al.</em> 1984ab). Organochlorines are still present in their blood, despite DDT levels in the environment (and PCBs to a lesser extent) declining from the early 1970s to the 1980s (Addison <em>et al.</em> 1984) and further in the 1990s and 2000s (Muir and de Wit 2010). <br/><br/>Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was first found in Harp Seals from the West Ice off Jan Mayen in 1987 and 1989. It is widespread in Harp Seals, but only shows up as antibodies; it is not known if there are significant health effects or mortality from PDV infection in this species (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 1993, Duignan <em>et al.</em> 1997). Harp Seals might have been the carriers responsible for the Harbour Seal PDV epidemic in Europe in 1988 (Markussen and Have 1992). PDV also appeared Harp Seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1991, but not in epidemic proportions (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 1993). <br/><br/>Global climate warming is of notable concern for this species. There have already been major reductions in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Laidre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Pinnipeds such as the Harp Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting and resting are likely to be heavily impacted by future changes in their sea ice habitats (Johnston <em>et al.</em> 2005, Friedlaender <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011,&#160;Kovacs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The high variability in pup production numbers in Canada, as well as the condition declines in the Northeast Atlantic, are thought to be linked to changing oceanographic and sea ice conditions. The degree of plasticity Harp Seals might show with respect to temporal or spatial shifts in breeding times and areas is not known.","The Harp Seal is the most abundant pinniped species in the northern hemisphere. Globally this species numbers close to nine million animals with an annual pup production for all breeding sites combined of approximately 1.2 million (ICES 2013, Hammill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The Northwest Atlantic stock is estimated to number close to 7.5 million (Hammill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is thought to be relatively stable, showing little change between the 2004 and 2012 surveys, although pup production has become highly variable with extremely high pup mortality in some recent years. This is a marked recovery from an estimated low of around 1.8 million in the early 1970s, which was a result of overharvesting (Sergeant 1976). Over the period of recovery, catch levels have been increased such that they likely approached potential biological removal levels by the late 1990s (see Johnston <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000). The current quota of 400,000 is likely not sustainable, but this is not a concern because the combined Greenlandic and Canadian harvest average only about half of this number. <br/><br/>The breeding group in the West Ice near Jan Mayen (often referred to as the Greenland Sea population) was estimated to be 296,000 in 1994; this population increased to approximately 348,000 by 2003 and in 2013 was estimated to be 627,000 (ICES 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The quota is approximately 20,000 animals, but an average take in the hunt in recent years is about 6,000 (ICES 2013). <br/><br/>The White Sea breeding group was estimated to be 1.8 million animals when surveyed in 2000 (Potelov <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). An estimate produced in 2013 using data from several pup counts done between 1998 and 2010 suggested that the population had dropped to 1.4 million, most likely due to reduced pup production (ICES 2013). Hunting in recent years in the White Sea has been extremely limited (annual takes of zero to 200 animals); harvesting of pups less than one year of age was banned in Russia in 2009. Norwegian harvests of this population during summer when they are in the Barents Sea have also been very small in recent years, with no hunt at all in 2013 (ICES 2013).<br/><br/>A new Harp Seal whelping patch was found near South Greenland in 2007 (Rosing-Asvid 2008). The source of these animals and the inter-annual stability of this group are not known. This finding was particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Greenlandic harvest of this species has increased from about 1,500 per year in the 1970s up to approximately 100,000 in the year 2000, and has remained at an average of around 85,000 since then (DFO 2012).",Increasing,"Harp Seals are widespread in the North Atlantic and the adjacent Arctic Ocean and shelf seas. Their range extends from a western extreme in northern Hudson Bay and the Foxe Basin, Baffin Island and the Davis Strait, eastward through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Newfoundland region in the western North Atlantic, along the southwest and south coasts of Greenland, continuing east to Iceland and from there to northern Norway and the White, Barents and Kara Seas. The northern limit in the eastern North Atlantic is at least to Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard; in some years Harp Seals may range northward to between 82° and 85° north, depending on ice conditions (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Rice 1998, Lavigne 2002). <br/><br/>The southern limit of Harp Seal distribution off North America shifts southeast in some years to the Gulf of Maine and Sable Island where large numbers of animals have been recorded at times since the mid-1990s (Lacoste and Stenson 2000, Harris <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Lucas and Daoust 2002). Harp Seals often occur as vagrants outside this range, south to Virginia in the United States (Scheffer 1958, Rice 1998). Similarly in Europe, Harp Seals occasionally reach the United Kingdom (Ronald and Healy 1981), the Faroe Islands, Denmark, Germany, France and even Spain (van Bree 1997, Bloch <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Prehistorically, Harp Seals occurred in the Baltic Sea. Genetic drift, interspecific completion and overhunting by humans are all factors that are likely to have contributed to their extinction in that region (Stora and Ericson 2004).","Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Arctic, including coastal Northern Europeans (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Basques whalers began taking Harp Seals in the 1500s. By the mid-1600s, French settlers developed land-based netting techniques on the St. Lawrence River. French-Canadians exported 500 tons of oil per year by the mid-1700s, obtained from an estimated take of 6,000 Harp Seals per year. In Newfoundland, English settlers hunted Harp Seals on a larger scale that accounted for an estimated average take of 7,000-12,800 Seals per year for most of the 1700s. By the 1800s, schooner-based sealing developed and the number of Seals harvested rose dramatically; from 1803-1816 the average annual take was 117,000. The peak of sealing in the Northwest Atlantic occurred between 1818 and 1862, when 500,000 Seals were harvested in many years, with maximum yearly takes between 640,000 and 740,000. During that time, it is estimated that 18.3 million Harp Seals, mostly whitecoats, were killed for oil. The records show somewhat lower figures for the Northeast Atlantic. At Jan Mayen, the catch began falling in the late 1850s; the drop in catch was likely attributable to over-harvesting. From 1860 to 1900, an estimated 12.8 million Seals were harvested from the West Ice.<br/><br/>During the 20th century Harp Seals became more valued for their pelts than their oil. In 1917, 143,000 Seals were taken. The catch dropped for a time, then escalated in the 1950s, when it averaged 312,000 Seals per year. In 1960, Canada became concerned about the large numbers of adults being killed, so it placed limits on the length of the hunting season. During the 1960s, an average of 284,000 Seals were taken per year from the Northwest Atlantic stock. In the mid 1960s, adult females became protected on the breeding grounds, and Norway was excluded from sealing in Canadian waters. In 1971 a quota management program was established; from 1970 to 1987 quotas varied from 127,000 per year to 245,000 per year, but the actual harvest was often much lower than the quota (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In 1983, the European Economic Community imposed an import ban on all whitecoat products and the average annual harvest in Canadian waters fell to 52,000 Seals from 1983-1995. By 1987, Canada banned the killing of whitecoats and the focus of the hunt switched to beaters (post-weaning to 13 months of age; DFO 2006a). From 1999-2003, the estimated annual mortality of Harp Seals in the Northwest Atlantic was 453,962, broken down into an average of 232,915 taken in the commercial harvest by Canada, 83,000 taken from 1999-2002 in Greenland, and approximately 5,000 taken in the Canadian High Arctic, plus a by-catch of close to 20,000 in the Newfoundland Lumpfish fishery, plus an average annual struck and loss rate of 119,430 from all harvests (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The Canadian harvest increased with the combined three-year quota (“Total Allowable Catch”) introduced for the period 2003-2005 set at 975,000 (DFO 2005). Given the age structure of the current hunt, this quota would not be sustainable (see Johnston <em>et al.</em> 2000). The current quota is 400,000, but the number taken in the hunt is much less (see above). In addition to Canada’s commercial harvest, some Harp Seals are taken in subsistence hunts in Labrador, Newfoundland, northern Quebec and in Nunavut, as well as in Greenland. In Canada, aboriginal peoples and non-aboriginal coastal residents who reside north of latitude 53 degrees can hunt Seals for subsistence purposes without a permit (DFO 2006b).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, Norway established a commercial hunt in 1846, which peaked in the 1870s-1880s when annual catches ranged from 50,000 to 120,000 animals. In the 20th century, annual harvests increased to an average of more than 100,000 per year, with the maximum in the 1920s and 1930s when the catches were 200,000-300,000 per year. In 1989, Norway banned the killing of whitecoats (N-RFC 2005) and harvests in the last few decades have been small compared to historical numbers. Russia also banned the killing of white-coats in 2009 and the White Sea hunt has been almost negligible since that time.<br/><br/>The numbers of Harp Seals struck-and-lost in the both the current commercial hunts (which focus largely on one plus animals) and in subsistence hunting is high, and most harvest estimates do not account for this additional mortality (see Lavigne 1999). The struck and loss rate for Harp Seals in Greenland could be as high as 50% (Sjare and Stenson 2002).",Marine,"<p>Canada has in place sealing regulations pursuant to the 1993 Marine Mammal Regulations that require annual quotas, referred to as “Total Allowable Catches” hunting licenses, and official observers of the commercial Harp Seal hunt (DFO 2005). In the northeast Atlantic, quotas for sealing are based on recommendations made by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Russia is responsible for managing Harp Seals in the southeast part of the Barents Sea, while Norway is responsible for managing stocks in the Greenland Sea near Jan Mayen (N-RFC 2005, NMFCA 2006). However, these harvest control mechanisms are no longer particularly influential given the declining interest in Seal harvesting by commercial operators.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231341,41672,Pusa hispida,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, Ringed Seals are widely distributed in ice-covered waters of the northern hemisphere, and they may presently number about three million animals. Some of the subspecies, however, have restricted distributions and exist in much smaller numbers. With climatic warming, all subspecies will be negatively impacted by continuing decreases of ice habitats critical for their reproduction. Nevertheless, at this time Ringed Seals as a species do not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing, and are listed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>Pusa hispida ladogensis</em>, the Ladoga Seal, is assessed separately as Vulnerable and subspecies <em>P. h. saimensis</em>, the Saimaa Seal, is assessed as Endangered.","Ringed Seals are in many respects the “classic” ice-seal. Throughout most of their range they use sea ice exclusively as their breeding, molting, and resting (haul-out) habitat, rarely if ever moving onto land (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Their ability to create and maintain breathing holes in ice using the well-developed claws on their fore-flippers allows them to thrive in areas where even other ice-associated seals cannot reside. Although Ringed Seals are quite small they deal with the thermal challenges posed by the arctic winter by having a very thick blubber layer, and by building lairs (small caves) in the snow on top of sea ice during the winter. The lairs are particularly important for neonatal survival (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Ringed Seals also use natural cracks along pressure ridges and leads in the sea ice for surfacing and breathing. In Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk, Ringed Seals haul out and pup on ice but rest on shore during the ice-free period (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kelly <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Reported mean age at sexual maturity for female Ringed Seals varies in the literature from 3.5 to 7.1 years (Holst and Stirling 2002, Krafft <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Males likely do not participate in breeding before they are 8-10 years old. Body sizes vary considerably between regions (Frost and Lowry 1981, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Ringed seals are long lived, with ages close to 50 reported (Lydersen and Gjertz 1987). Regional productivity rates are variable; reproductive success depends on many factors including prey availability, the relative stability of the ice, and sufficient snow accumulation prior to the commencement of breeding (Lukin 1980, Smith 1987, Lydersen 1995). <br/><br/>A single pup is born in late February-early March for the Ladoga, Saimaa, and Baltic subspecies (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998) and March-May for the others (Frost and Lowry 1981). Most births occur in subnivean lairs excavated in snow that accumulates near ice ridges or shorelines. Lairs provide thermal protection against cold air temperatures and high wind chill and afford at least some protection from predators (Smith 1976, Smith and Stirling 1975, Gjertz and Lydersen 1986). For Arctic Ringed Seals, lactation lasts an average of 39 days and pups are weaned at approximately 20 kg (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999). Females become receptive for mating towards the end of the lactation period, similar to other phocid seals. <br/><br/>Ringed Seals molt from mid-May to mid-July and during that period they spend quite a bit of time hauled out (Reeves 1998). Feeding intensity is at a minimum during molting (Ryg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). <br/><br/>Although they may dive to more than 500 m (Born <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), in many areas where they feed the water is not that deep and dives are correspondingly shallower (Gjertz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Outside the breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seal distribution is correlated with food availability (e.g., Simpkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Freitas <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Numerous studies of their diet have been conducted, and although there is considerable regional variation several patterns emerge. Most Ringed Seal prey are small, and preferred prey tend to be schooling species that form dense aggregations. Fishes are usually in the 5-10 cm length range and crustacean prey in the 2-6 cm range. Typically, a variety of 10-15 prey species are found, with no more than 2-4 dominant prey species for any given area. Fishes are generally more commonly eaten than invertebrates, but diet is determined to some extent by availability of various types of prey during particular seasons as well as by preference, which in part is influenced by energy content of various available prey (Reeves 1998, Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Commonly eaten prey include Polar Cod, Arctic Cod, Saffron Cod, Redfish, Herring, and Capelin in marine waters (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Labansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and Smelt, Vendance, Perch, Roach, Stickleback, and Burbot in lakes (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Invertebrate prey species seem to become more important in the open-water season and often dominate the diet of young animals (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Large Amphipods, Krill, Mysids, Shrimps, and Cephalopods are all eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally (Agafonova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most important predator of Arctic Ringed Seals in most parts of their range and they are also eaten by Killer Whales and Walruses. Wolves, Wolverines, Foxes, Gulls, and Ravens may also prey on Ringed Seals, especially pups, in other areas (Reeves 1998).","Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers <em>et al</em>. 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).<br/><br/>Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta <em>et al</em>. 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Hezel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.<br/><br/>  Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1991; Moulton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999).","Available data on Ringed Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>&#160;Arctic Ringed Seal--1,450,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Okhotsk Ringed Seal--44,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Baltic Ringed Seal--11,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Ladoga Seal--3,000-4,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Saimaa Seal--135-190, trend increasing<br/></li></ul>The world-wide population size of Ringed Seals is not accurately known. Some recent survey data are available from parts of their range (see subspecies assessments), but for the Arctic and Okhotsk subspecies data are limited in spatial scope. Citing many factors such as the vast geographic area occupied by the species, its highly variable distribution within areas that have been surveyed, the unknown relationship between the numbers of individuals observed versus those not seen, and other factors, Frost and Lowry (1981) stated that it is “unwise to attempt an estimate of the world population of this subspecies”. Despite numerous surveys at specific locales conducted since then, Reeves (1998) believed that “this conclusion remains appropriate.”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the figures presented above indicate the number of mature individuals is more than 1.5 million, and the total population size is likely more than 3 million.",Unknown,"Ringed Seals have a circumpolar distribution throughout the Arctic Basin including records of individuals near the North Pole (Rice 1998). Ringed Seals also range widely into adjacent seas being found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, and Greenland, Barents, White, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas, and they occasionally range into some lake and river systems in Northern Canada (Heide-Jørgensen and Lydersen 1998). Separate subspecies occur in the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga in the Russian Federation, Lake Saimaa in Finland, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Extralimital records for Ringed Seals extend far south on both sides of the Atlantic, to New Jersey USA in the west and Portugal in the east. In the Pacific, vagrants have been recorded south to the Zhejiang in China and southern California&#160;USA (Rice 1998).","Humans have hunted Ringed Seals in the Arctic since the arrival of people to the region millennia ago (e.g., Murdoch 1893, Riewe and Amsden 1979). They are a fundamental subsistence food item for most coastal dwelling northern indigenous peoples. Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1998) reported a combined estimate of 10,000 taken per year from the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas by Russians and Alaska Natives. They also estimated that the annual removal of Ringed Seals in the Canadian Arctic was in the “high tens of thousands”, and that in the 1980s, including animals killed and lost, the harvest was between 60,000 and 80,000, and may have exceeded 100,000 in some years. Another substantial annual harvest occurs in Greenland with nearly 100,000 taken per year in the 1970s and approximately 70,000 taken annually in the early1990s (Teilmann and Kapel 1998).<br/><br/>Commercial harvests of Ringed Seals in the early to mid-20th century were sometimes large and probably had significant local impacts on the respective populations. Harvest statistics reported for western Russia by Belikov and Boltunov (1998) suggest that maximum catches earlier in the 20th century exceeded the total allowable catches (TACs) significantly, with harvests of up to 8,900 in the White Sea (1912), 13,200 in the Russian Barents Sea (1962), and 13,200 in the Kara Sea (1933). Those harvests are thought to have dropped considerably in recent decades, though there are no available data. Reporting of harvest statistics and enforcement of TACs is difficult to manage in outlying areas, and the harvest of Ringed Seals in eastern Russia is largely unknown.<br/><br/>Although Ringed Seals in the Baltic and Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa were hunted in the past, hunting is no longer allowed (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Ringed Seals are protected by a variety of laws and quotas in different parts of their range, but even within Europe the legal provisions are not always being fully implemented in domestic law (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001). The population in Lake Saimaa has been protected since 1955, and additional protection has been afforded via the establishment of two national parks within the lake, and regulation of shoreline development. Similarly, the hunting of Seals in Lake Ladoga was prohibited in 1980 (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). In the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 allows Ringed Seals to be harvested only by Alaskan Native hunters for subsistence purposes, and that Act generally prohibits all other forms of taking except where specifically permitted. In 2012, the Arctic, Okhotsk, and Baltic subspecies were listed as threatened, and the Ladoga subspecies was listed as endangered, under the US Endangered Species Act; the Saimaa subspecies was listed as endangered in 1993. <a name=""_GoBack""></a>State Nature Reserves at Franz Josef Land and in the White and Kara seas protect large areas of Ringed Seal habitat in the western Russian Arctic, and quotas and licensing of hunting have been in place in various parts of the Russian Federation for decades (Belikov and Boltunov 1998). Baltic Ringed Seals were protected from all killing by the Soviet Union in 1980, by Sweden in 1986, and by Finland in 1988 (Härkönen <em>et al</em>. 1998).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231738,41676,Pusa sibirica,Least Concern,,2016,2015-07-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The current population size of the Baikal Seal is thought to be at the level of the Lake Baikal ecosystem’s carrying capacity (80,000–100,000 individuals). If global warming continues the quality of habitat of the species will decline dramatically which may cause the population to decline. However, Baikal Seals have survived periods of quite extreme warming in the past and the population undergoes periodic monitoring such that declines would be detected rapidly should they occur. Thus, at the current time the Baikal Seal is listed as Least Concern.","Baikal Seals are an exclusively freshwater species, and are thought to derive from the marine ancestor of the <em>Pusa </em>genus. It is hypothesized they colonized Lake Baikal from the Arctic via rivers and glacial dam lakes present in northern Siberia 300,000-400,000 years ago (McLaren 1960, Pastukhov 1969a, Koyama <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997, Sasaki <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palo and Väinöla 2006). However, this is at odds with the current DNA sequence based estimate of around 2 million years for the divergence of the <em>Pusa </em>genus. This suggest a complex history of vicariance with the group, but the underlying paleogeography remains to be determined (Palo and Väinöla 2006, Fulton and Strobeck 2010, Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012).<br/><br/>Baikal Seals are among the smallest of the pinnipeds, with adults reaching 1.1-1.4 m and weights of 50-130 kg. Pups are born at 3-3.5 kg and approximately 70 cm (Pastukhov 1971, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982). Adult males at physical maturity are slightly larger than adult females of the same age. Final body size is reached at approximately 15 years of age (Amano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Males reach sexual maturity at 7-10 years of age (Pastukhov 1993). Female Baikal Seals become sexually mature between 3-7 years and some have their first pup by age 4, most by 5-6 years, with some not pupping until they are 9 years old (Pastukhov 1969b, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982). Baikal Seals continue to produce pups until they are 43-45 years old and may have the greatest longevity of any pinniped species. Approximately 10% of the population is older than 20 years of age, with records of adult females reaching 56 years of age and adult males 52 years of age (Pastukhov 1990, 1993).<br/><br/>The annual cycle of the Baikal Seal is driven by ice more than food (Ivanov 1938). In mid-October, the Seals begin to move towards bays, lagoons and river deltas, mostly along the eastern shore where ice forms and expands out into the lake. They spend January to May spread throughout the lake, usually singly, in deep water in the central basins. Adults stay primarily in the north while immature Seals are more often found in the southern part of Lake Baikal. Pups are born from late February to early April, with peak numbers born in mid March (Pastukhov 1990). Pupping takes place on the ice in dens that females actively build and maintain. During the pupping season, females are widely spread out on the ice. Their surface home ranges, including the den and breathing holes, are a minimum of 0.26 km² and do not overlap with other females (Ivanov 1938, Elagin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990, Pastukhov 1993, Martinkova <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Pups do not usually enter the water for their first 2-3 weeks.<br/><br/>Most pups are weaned in 2-2.5 months, although some are believed to be nursed for 3-3.5 months (Pastukhov 1971). Females move pups and construct new dens if the dens become damaged; this may be necessary to protect small pups from predators. Mating is believed to take place in April, approximately one month after the female gives birth (Pastukhov 1993). Although births take place throughout the lake, more pups (51%) are born in the northern third of the lake, as compared to the central third (31%) or the southern third (17%) (Pastukhov 1971, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982, Petrov <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997).<br/><br/>The ice breaks up in May and June, a time when Baikal Seals undergo their annual moult. More than half of the population moves to the remaining ice in the northern and northeastern parts of Lake Baikal, forming aggregations that can be as large as 1,000-3,000 animals. Moulting takes place during an approximately month-long period, during which Baikal Seals feed very little (Pastukhov 1993). Many Baikal Seals congregate in the southeastern part of the lake in the ice-free season to haul-out on rocky islands and shorelines between feeding excursions (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993, Petrov <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The eastern side of the lake is preferred because it has less human disturbance and greater biological productivity (Pastukhov 1993). It is not known whether Baikal Seals have a regular annual movement pattern. Satellite-tagging of four juvenile Seals revealed that they moved throughout the lake in the course of a year, traveling from 400 to 1,600 km between September through May. Although it may not be typical of adult Seals, the pattern of frequent diving and movement demonstrates that juveniles move considerable distances and spend little time hauled-out during the fall and winter months. Two of the four Seals tagged in autumn returned to their tagging sites the following spring after wandering widely throughout the lake (Stewart <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996). Diving patterns are not well documented; tagged juvenile Baikal Seals dived most frequently to between 10 and 50 m, with some dives exceeding 300 m. The mean depth in Lake Baikal is 758 m (Kutyrev <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Dive depths were shallower at night, consistent with the vertical movements of their preferred prey fish, the two species of Golomyankas (<em>Comeophorus </em>spp.) that ascend from depths of 100 m or more during the day to forage at 10-25 m at night. Dive durations were generally 2-4 minutes, with 14-30% of dives lasting 6-10 minutes. The longest recorded dives exceeded 40 minutes and occurred during the winter in areas of heavy ice cover (Stewart <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996). Baikal Seals feed on fish and 29 species have been recorded in their diet. Along with the two species of Golomyankas mentioned above, they also consume two species of Sculpin (<em>Cottocomephorus </em>spp.) as primary prey. Diversity of fish species consumed is highest in the summer with 17 species eaten, declining to 8 species in fall, and only 4 principal species eaten in winter. Juveniles may also consume amphipods during winter (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1967, Gurova and Pastukhov 1974, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982).","Major rivers flowing into Lake Baikal pass through regions of industrial activity and there are concerns over contamination from persistent organic pollutants such as polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs), dioxins, flame retardants and other related chemicals (Mamontov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Exposure to such bioaccumulative chemicals has potential to impair fertility and immunocompetence (De Swart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, Kannan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Numerous studies have assessed contaminant levels in Baikal Seals from the 1990s to present (e.g., Kucklick <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994; Nakata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, 1997; Tarasova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997; Tanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003; Tsydenova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, 2004; Iwata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004; Ishibashi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008; Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). These show complex and varying temporal trends, with levels of DDTs and non-ortho PCBs declining through the 1990s to mid-2000s, while others such as mono-ortho PCBs showed no decline and perflourochemicals increased (Tanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Tsydenova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Ishibashi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). This variation reflects differences in environmental half-life and rates of inflow of chemicals stemming from changes in industrial usage patterns.<br/><br/>Overall contaminant burdens at the population level for Baikal Seals are lower than pinniped species from areas of Europe and North America with high industrial contamination, but greater than Seals from ‘cleaner’ Arctic environments, although some individual animals have been found to have high burdens. The most recent study (Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009) found that 40% of Seals in the tested sample from 2005 had TEQ (Toxic Equivalent – a measure for summarising relative toxicity of complex contaminant mixtures) levels above a threshold associated with immune suppressive effects identified in Harbour Seals (De Swart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Organochlorine accumulation is age related, so older adult males are the most likely component of the population to be above these thresholds (Iwata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). However, demonstrating effects of contaminants in the wild is difficult, and there is currently no direct evidence of contaminant burdens affecting disease susceptibility or influencing population demography in Baikal Seals. Recent studies on liver gene expression profiles in Baikal Seals suggest changes to liver metabolism consistent with toxicity in relation to environmental contaminant exposure, but the overall health significance is not clear (Hirakawa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Industrial development is increasing around the Baikal watershed so it is important that monitoring of contaminant exposure in Baikal Seals is continued in the future (Reijnders <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993, Nakata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Mamontov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Grachev 2002, Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>An outbreak of a canine distemper virus killed approximately 6,500 Baikal Seals in 1987-1988 (Grachev <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989, Pronin and Kabanov 1992, Belykov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997), and is believed to have been transmitted to Seals from a terrestrial source, probably feral or domestic Dogs (Barrett <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Recent surveys show that the virus is still circulating in the population, although without causing further mass mortalities to date (Mamaev <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Butina <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, 2010). However, future epizootics remain possible, and it is recommended that surveillance of CDV strains circulating in the population be continued (Butina <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Natural predation does not appear to be a significant source of mortality for Baikal Seals, with only Brown Bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) reported as predators (Pastukhov 1993).<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species, Baikal Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change since they cannot move to alternative habitats (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Future climate warming has the potential to reduce the extent and duration of ice-habitat Baikal Seals rely on for breeding, and to also affect Baikal food webs (Mackay <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Hampton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Moore <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009), both of which could drive population declines. The potential effects of changes in winter ice on Baikal Seal population demography remain to be assessed in detail, but the species has persisted through previous episodes of climate variation.","Following hunting in the early 20th Century, the Baikal Seal population increased from the 1970s through the early 1990s to over 100,000 individuals (Petrov <em>et al</em>. 1997; Petrov 2002, 2003). Population abundance&#160;subsequently&#160;declined slightly, probably due to commercial harvesting and outbreaks of canine distemper virus.&#160;Reports of current&#160;abundance vary between the different studies carried out since 2002, with estimates ranging&#160;between 82,500 and 115,000 individuals including pups (Petrov 2002, 2003, 2006; Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). The most recently reported figures derive from surveys carried out by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources (2013), and report an increase from 97,400 individuals in 2012 to 108,200 in 2013, with an estimated pup production of 23,600, although the methodological details of this survey are not available. The population estimates may be subject to survey errors of about 30% (Petrov <em>et al</em>. 1997), and incomplete or inadequate coverage of the breeding range throughout the lake makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions about population demography. Therefore, short term abundance trends based on count data may merely reflect survey error variations. Currently Baikal Seals are considered to be at the carrying capacity level of the Baikal Lake ecosystem.",Stable,"Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, Russia, near the Mongolian border. The lake is 636 km long and at its maximum 79.5 km wide (Kutyrev <em>et al</em>. 2006). Baikal Seals are basically confined to Lake Baikal (31,570 km²), though they do travel short distances into rivers that flow into and out of the lake. An exception is one animal that was found 400 km downstream in the Angara River, the only river that flows out of the lake (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993, Rice 1998).","Subsistence hunting of the Baikal Seal extends back at least 9,000 years to the Neolithic period (Khlobystin 1963, Weber <em>et al.</em> 1993, Nomokonova <em>et al.</em> 2015). Commercial hunting began in the second half of the 18th century (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993), becoming a regular industry in the early in the 20th century. Annual harvests fluctuated between 2,000 and 9,000 Seals in the early 20th century, then from under 1,000 to nearly 6,500 in the 1930s (Svatosh 1923, 1925; Ivanov 1938). Harvests from 1977 to 1983 were consistently high. The official harvest quota and catch level was about 6,000, plus an estimated “unofficial hunting” level of up to 3,600 Seals (Pastukhov 1993). In the late 1980s and early 1990s the official statistics were not reliable and did not reflect the actual harvest level. Estimates vary between 4,000 and 8,000 animals (Petrov <em>et al.</em> 1997) killed annually. Harvesting continues today. During 2004-2006 about 2,000 Seals were reported killed in annual official statistics with estimations of an additional “uncounted” harvest of between 1,500 and 4,000 animals annually (Petrov 2007). The “uncounted” harvest includes wounded or drowned animals, incidental catch in fishing gear, and poaching. More recently, total hunting including poaching was estimated at between 2,300-2,800 annually for 2012 and 2013 (Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). A quota of 2,500 was set for the official hunt in 2013-2014, with a Potential Biological Removal level of 5,000 individuals. There are some calls to expand hunting, with skins, meat, and blubber as the products being utilized.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Numerous measures, such as establishing commercial harvest quotas, changing methods and equipment used for harvesting Seals, and changing the timing of the hunt and the age class of Seal that can be taken, have all been used during the history of the commercial harvest to regulate the catch (Svatosh 1923, 1925; Ivanov 1938; Pastukhov 1993; Petrov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). Recent recommendations for the protection and conservation of the Baikal Seal include several measures to reduce the impact of poaching by local residents (including increased penalties for illegal hunting) and mandatory reporting of incidental catch in fishing gear (Pastukhov 1993). There are many protected areas and reserves throughout Lake Baikal.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species is generally widespread. Black-backed Jackals are relatively unspecialized canids and well suited for an opportunistic lifestyle in a wide variety of habitats. The species is persecuted for its role as livestock killers and as rabies vectors. However, population control efforts appear largely ineffective and probably only succeed in producing a temporary reduction in local numbers.","Black-backed Jackals are found in a wide variety of habitats including arid coastal desert (Dreyer and Nel 1990), montane grassland (Rowe-Rowe 1982), open savanna (Wyman 1967, Kingdon 1977, Lamprecht 1978, Moehlman 1983, Fuller <em>et al.</em> 1989, Estes 1991), woodland savanna mosaics (Smithers 1971, Loveridge and Macdonald 2002) and farmland. In general, Black-backed Jackals show a preference for open habitats tending to avoid dense vegetation (Pienaar 1969). In KwaZulu-Natal, they are recorded from sea level to more than 3,000 m asl. in the Drakensberg, and in localities receiving more than 2,000 mm of rainfall (Rowe-Rowe 1982, 1992); they have been recorded from the alpine zone of Mt Kenya at 3,660 m (Young and Evans 1993). Where more than one jackal species occur in sympatry the habitat is partitioned. The trend is for Black-backed Jackals to use preferentially either the open grassland (when sympatric with Side-striped Jackal; Loveridge 1999) or wooded savanna (when sympatric with Golden and Side-striped Jackals; Fuller <em>et al</em>. 1989). In western Zimbabwe, habitat partitioning was mediated by aggressive encounters in which Black-backed Jackals displaced Side-striped Jackals from grassland habitats (Loveridge 1999).","There are no major threats to the species. Black-backed Jackals are persecuted for their role as livestock killers and as rabies vectors (Black-based Jackals are very susceptible to rabies, and are responsible for transmission of the disease to domestic stock). However, population control efforts appear largely ineffective and probably only succeed in producing a temporary reduction in local numbers. In any case, rabies in jackals may be better controlled through oral vaccination techniques, and through immunization of domestic dogs, than by culling (Loveridge and Macdonald 2001).","Black-backed Jackals are generally widespread and, in Namibia and South Africa, they are common in protected areas where suitable habitat occurs.

The disjunct distribution of this species is similar to that of other endemic African species adapted to dry conditions (e.g., Aardwolf <em>Proteles cristatus</em> and Bat-eared Fox <em>Otocyon megalotis</em>). The two Black-backed Jackal ranges are separated by as much as 1,000 km and their discontinuous distribution suggests that regions of dry Acacia bush and savanna, the preferred habitat of this species, once connected south-west Africa and the Horn of Africa.<br/><br/>Fossils of Black-backed Jackals have been found in deposits in South Africa dating to at least two million years ago (Hendey 1974), but fossil remains have never been found north of Ethiopia suggesting that they have always been restricted to sub-Saharan Africa.","There is no significant trade in jackal products, although body parts are used in traditional African medicine and clothing.",Terrestrial,"The species is not included in the CITES Appendices and has no legal protection outside protected areas.

In western North America, it is commonly found in mixed agricultural/woodland/chaparral/riparian landscapes and shrub habitats. The species occupies forested areas and thick brush habitats in Central America and forested montane habitats in South America (Eisenberg 1989).

There are no major threats to the species at present, although poisoning of pikas (a major prey item) in much of the Tibetan plateau poses a concern. Nonetheless, there is no evidence that the species is currently undergoing a decline that would warrant listing in a threatened category.","The species is found in upland plains and hills from about 2,500–5,200 m (Clark&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008);&#160;however, the preponderance of Tibetan Fox habitat is &gt;3,000 m, and the majority of that &gt; 4,000 m. Most of its habitat consists of sparse grasslands devoid of trees and shrubs (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2007; although see also Gong and Hu 2003), particularly where Black-lipped Pikas are abundant. It appears that Tibetan Foxes are closely tied to the presence of pikas, and may in fact be an obligate predator (Harris <em>et al</em>. in press). Tibetan Foxes appear particularly adept at capturing pikas (including, at times, following brown bears <em>Ursus arctos</em> excavating pika burrows in order to capture pikas that escape; Harris <em>et al</em>. 2008), and are rarely encountered where pikas are absent. They also feed on carrion, and other small mammals (Zheng 1985).&#160;Tibetan Foxes spend considerable time resting in small burrows, hollows and rock crevasses (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2003).

Ongoing government-sponsored programmes involving poisoning of pikas, the main prey, takes place across much of the Tibetan plateau and poses the main threat; secondary poisoning of Tibetan Foxes may occur, although does not appear to be common.

However, their general versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. Red Foxes have caused considerable damage where they have been introduced; their impacts on Australian fauna has been particularly well documented; control takes place by setting baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate).","Red Fox density is highly variable. In the United Kingdom, density varies between one fox/40 km² in Scotland and 1.17/km² in Wales, but can be as high as 30 foxes/km² in some urban areas where food is superabundant (Harris 1977, Macdonald and Newdick 1982, Harris and Rayner 1986). Social group density is one family per km² in farmland, but may vary between 0.2-5 families/km² in the suburbs (Macdonald 1981). Fox density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is three foxes/km² (Meia 1994). Murdoch (2009) recorded 0.17 foxes/km²&#160;&#160;in the grassland/semi desert steppe of Mongolia.&#160;In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, they occur at densities of 0.1 foxes/km², and in southern Ontario, Canada at 1 fox/km² (Voigt 1987). The average social group density in the Swiss mountains is 0.37 families/km² (Weber <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The pre-breeding British fox population has been estimated at ~240,000 individuals (Harris <em>et al.</em> 1995). Mean number of foxes killed per unit area by gamekeepers has increased steadily since the early 1960s in Britain, but it is not clear to what extent this reflects an increase in fox abundance. Although an increase in fox numbers following successful rabies control by vaccination was widely reported in Europe (e.g., fox bag in Germany has risen from 250,000 in 1982–1983 to 600,000 in 2000–2001), no direct measures of population density have been taken.",Stable,"The Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million km²) being distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to southern North America, Europe, North Africa, the Asiatic steppes, India, and Japan.

The species was also introduced to Australia in the 1800s, and to Tasmania in the late 1990s (although there is evidence that an eradication campaign for Red Foxes on Tasmania has proved effective; see Caley <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elsewhere introduced to the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and to the Isle of Man (UK), although they never properly established on the Isle of Man (Reynolds and Short 2003) and may subsequently have disappeared.","The number of foxes raised for fur (although much reduced since the 1900s) exceeds that of any other species, except possibly American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>) (Obbard 1987). Types farmed are particularly colour variants (""white"", ""silver"" and ""cross"") that are rare in the wild.&#160;Worldwide trade in ranched Red Fox pelts (mainly ""silver"" pelts from Finland) was 700,000 in 1988–1989 (excluding internal consumption in the USSR). Active fur trade in Britain in 1970s was negligible.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in CITES Appendices at species level. However, the subspecies <em>griffithi</em>, <em>montana</em> and <em>pusilla</em> (=<em>leucopus</em>) are listed on CITES – Appendix III (India).&#160;<br/><br/>Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the European Union, Canada, and the Russian Federation, trapping methods are regulated under an agreement on international trapping standards between these countries, which was signed in 1997. Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the United Kingdom and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained ""use"" may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport – the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint – hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs. This type of fox hunting may also be perceived as a sport by its participants.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Present in most temperate-subarctic conservation areas.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>In addition to fur farms, Red Foxes are widely kept in small wildlife parks and zoos, but there appears to be no systematic data on their breeding success.

48075169,23050,Vulpes cana,Least Concern,,2015,2015-07-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern as available evidence suggests that Blanford's Fox has a relatively wide distribution albeit largely confined to mountainous regions. It is fairly common in some parts of its range, and while the species may possibly be undergoing some localized declines, there is at present no evidence to suggest any range-wide decline that would meet the thresholds for a threatened category or for Near Threatened.","Blanford's Fox generally occurs in mountainous regions. Hassinger (1973) concluded that Blanford's Foxes are usually found below an altitude of 2,000 m asl in dry montane biotopes, (although see Peters and Rödel 1994). All the records collected on the Iranian Plateau are from foothills and mountains in the vicinity of lower plains and basins (Hassinger 1973, Roberts 1977). In that region, the habitat of the Blanford's Fox comprises the slopes of rocky mountains with stony plains and patches of cultivation (Lay 1967, Roberts 1977) and they appear to avoid higher mountain ranges as well as lower, warmer valleys (Roberts 1977). In the Middle East, Blanford's Foxes are confined to mountainous desert ranges and inhabit steep, rocky slopes, canyons and cliffs (Mendelssohn <em>et al.</em> 1987, Harrison and Bates 1991); their distribution is apparently not limited by access to water (Geffen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992a). In Israel, Blanford's Foxes inhabit the driest and hottest regions, being distributed along the western side of the Rift Valley, and, in the central Negev, where specimens were collected in creeks that drain into the Rift Valley (Geffen <em>et al</em>. 1993). The densest population is found in the Judaean Desert at elevations of 100–350 m below sea level, in contrast to Roberts' (1977) remark that the species avoids low, warm valleys in Pakistan. <br/><br/>Geffen <em>et al</em>. (1992b) found that dry creek bed was the most frequently visited habitat in all home ranges in Israel. Dry creek bed provided abundant prey for the foxes and only sparse cover for their terrestrial predators. Creek bed patches were used in proportion to their size. Both the available area of creek bed in each range and the area of creek bed patches that was used by the foxes were independent of home range size. However, variance in home range size was explained by the mean distance between the main denning area and the most frequently used patches of creek bed (Geffen <em>et al</em>. 1992b).","There are currently no obvious major threats resulting in range-wide declines of Blanford's Fox. However, general habitat loss, due mainly to expanding settlement and tourism development, and human persecution and indirect mortality, do pose localized threats (Abu-Baker <em>et al</em>. 2004, Mallon and Budd 2011). In Israel, habitat loss is limited as most of the area where this species occurs is designated as protected. However, political developments may change the status of the northern Judaean Desert, and human development along the Dead Sea coasts may also pose a considerable threat to existing habitat. Similar concerns exist for the populations in the U.A.E. (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2003). Indirect mortality is usually a result of animals being killed incidentally through carcass poisoning of other target species, such as hyaenas and wolves. The current situation in Iran and Pakistan is unknown.","The only available population densities come from Israel and Jordan. In Israel, where the species is fairly common in the south-east, density estimates of 2.0/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Ein Gedi and 0.5/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Eilat have been recorded (Geffen 1994). In Jordan, density using the Bondrup-Nielsen formula identified 8.5 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Eid <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Surveys in other regions indicate that Blanford's Fox is locally abundant. In United Arab Emirates, for example, researchers frequently captured foxes in the northeastern mountains of the country (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2003).",Stable,"The Blanford's Fox has a disjunct distribution.&#160;Originally known only from southwestern Asia (Novikov 1962, Bobrinskii&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1965, Lay 1967, Hassinger 1973, Roberts 1977), in 1981 this species was discovered in Israel (Ilany 1983) and subsequently found to occur more widely in&#160;arid mountainous regions in the Arabian Peninsula.&#160;Peters and Rödel (1994) reviewed available distribution records of this species and, for the easterly part of the range, provided what they considered to be definite records from around the Iranian Plateau in&#160;Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, with more questionable records (usually based on skins obtained from fur bazaars or otherwise indirectly) from Afghanistan and Tajikistan (though there is no obvious reason why they should not occur).<br/><br/>In the Middle East, there are now confirmed records from Jordan, the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt), Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (Mendelssohn <em>et al</em>. 1987, Harrison and Bates 1989,&#160;Harrison and Bates&#160;1991, Al Khalili 1993, Stuart and Stuart 1995, Amr <em>et al</em>. 1996, Amr 2000, Cunningham and Howarth 2002, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003, Abu-Baker <em>et al</em>. 2004, Cunningham and Wronski 2009, Mallon and Budd 2011, Eid <em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Eid&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015). They have long been suspected to occur in Yemen, and were recorded by Al Jumaily <em>et al</em>. (2012) in Hawf Forest in Al Mahra Governorate in extreme eastern Yemen, close to the borders with Oman, at an altitude of about 1,200 m asl. It also seemed likely that they would be shown to occur in western Yemen where contiguous with mountains in southwest Arabia (Mallon and Budd 2011), and a camera-trapping record by Mohammed Al-Qudamy in February 2014 in Wadi Sharis (Wadi Sharas) in Hajjah Governorate, NW of Sana'a, now confirms their occurrence (D. Mallon pers. comm. 2015). There is a single record from Egypt, west of the Suez Canal, in Wadi Qiseib from an animal collected in 1988, and originally thought to be <em>Vulpes rueppellii</em> (Peters and Rödel 1994, Geffen and Peters 2013). There are no confirmed records from Syria, though they might possibly occur (Masseti 2009).","At present, the trade in fur is negligible.

Total numbers are estimated at 140,000, with about 30% occurring in protected areas. Only about 25% of the population is considered stable or increasing and the rest declining. If this downward trend continues, then it is only a matter of time before the species becomes Near Threatened. Peter's Gazelle is of particular cause for concern as it has the lowest population size (&lt;15,000) and is declining, with its range inadequately covered by protected areas.","The habitat of all subpecies encompasses subdesert, lowland thorn bush, savanna woodland, open plains, and montane grassland up to 2,500 m. Grant's Gazelle inhabits open, dry plains and open savannas, including some high, cool uplands. Its habitat is typified by the plains and savannas of Serengeti National Park (Siegismund&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). Capitalizing on its water-independence, Grant's Gazelle makes a living in areas beyond the reach of herbivores that need to drink. Some even migrate to short-grass plains in the dry season and the savanna woodland during rains - opposite to the main migration. But large herds also share wet-season range and mix with the more numerous Thomson's Gazelle (Estes 1991). A large part of the range of Bright's Gazelle is very dry, but it periodically inhabits cool upland savannas and semi-deserts. In more south-eastern parts it tolerates more wooded country than the other species (Siegismund <em>et al.</em> 2013). Peter's Gazelle is essentially a lowland species and in the Tana River delta lives on very flat plains that are periodically flooded (Siegismund&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).","The species as a whole remains widespread within and outside protected areas, despite the loss of parts of its range to the expansion of agriculture and the decline of some populations because of poaching and competition with increasing numbers of livestock. It is nevertheless of concern that its numbers appear to be in decline over large parts of its range (e.g., Tsavo) and that populations which were known to be stable or increasing comprise only about 25% of the species’ total numbers (East 1999).","Recent population estimates are available for most of the species' current range, mainly from aerial surveys. Summation of these estimates gives a total of about 140,000, but this is probably an underestimate of the total numbers because of undercounting in aerial surveys and the lack of population estimates for some areas. Population trend is downward, with some exceptions such as Sibiloi and Marsabit National Parks and some of Kenya’s northern rangeland districts, Laikipia, Masai Mara National Reserve, Amboseli, Serengeti, Tarangire and Mkomazi. The largest population of Grant's Gazelles (<em>sensu stricto</em>) occupies the Serengeti ecosystem with an estimated 35,000-55,000, with 4,300 in the Tarangire area in 2011 (Foley <em>et al</em>. 2014).

In the mid-1990s the Beisa Oryx population in Ethiopia was thought to be around 5,000 individuals (East 1999). A decline in numbers mirroring that of the Kenyan population is likely, with just several hundred animals being counted in key locations such as the Alledeghi plains in recent years (Kebede 2009). Hence, a global population size of less than 12,000 Beisa Oryx individuals including those reported in South Sudan (Republic of South Sudan 2015)&#160;is likely to remain, although this may be an overestimate based on low densities of animals being reported in more recent aerial surveys (Woodfine and Parker 2011, KWS 2012).<br/><br/>A high number of oryx is known to occur in Nakuprat-Gotu conservancy, Kenya, especially the eastern part and Shaba National Reserve.

Most populations are highly migratory or nomadic (Schaller 1998, Schaller <em>et al.</em> 2006), moving up to 300-400 km between summer and winter ranges; others are nonmigratory or migrate&#160;over much shorter distances&#160;(Harris and Miller 1995, Leslie and Schaller 2008). Males and females are usually separate except for the mating period. Females congregate to give birth in traditional birthing grounds, some of which (e.g. Central Kunlun) have only recently been identified. The ecological parameters of these sites are not fully understood. In Chang Tang Nature Reserve, Chiru had a negative association with settlements and preferred areas with gentle slopes, moderate density of grazing livestock, villages only at lower elevations (Qi <em>et al.</em> 2015).","The prevalence and magnitude of commercial scale hunting of Chiru for shahtoosh in the late 1980s and 1990s led to a severe decline in numbers (Wright and Kumar 1997). Since, measures to restrict illegal hunting and smuggling of the product have become increasingly effective, however the demand still exists and maintaining strict controls on poaching, trade, and manufacture of the fabric are essential in ensuring the status of the species. Other important threats include expansion of livestock herding into remote and previously unused areas (Fox and Bårdsen 2005), for instance Chiru in the Chang Tang region now shares rangeland with &gt;8 million livestock (Harris 2008); road building, facilitating the expansion of agriculture and illegal hunting (Yin <em>et al.</em> 2006); and fencing of pastures on the Tibetan plateau (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2009). Construction of the Beijing-Lhasa railway threatened to divide the Chiru's range but engineering measures, such as underpasses, have allowed the Chiru's migration to continue to some extent. Chiru are also vulnerable to severe winter conditions, especially heavy snow, which can confine populations to limited areas and can result in disproportionate death of young, subadults, and females, presumably from malnutrition (Leslie and Schaller 2008). An exceptional snowstorm in Qinghai in 1985 caused high mortality and led to their disappearance from some areas especially in the eastern part of their range (Schaller and Ren 1988).","Numbers may have reached a historic high of perhaps one million but are far less now. The population underwent a severe decline in the 1980s and early 1990s as a result of commercial poaching for the valuable underfur, leading to an estimated 65,000-72,500 by the mid-1990s (Schaller 1998). Rigorous protection has been enforced since then. Leslie and Schaller (2008) suggested there may be 100,000.  Feng (1999) estimated 100,000 to 120,000, while Xi and Wang (2004) estimated 150,000. Liu (2009) said the population had doubled since the mid-1990s (i.e. now <em>ca</em> 150,000). Densities of 0.03-9.21 individuals/km²<sup></sup>, with an average of 1.77/km²<sup></sup> were reported by Leslie and Schaller (2008). The migratory nature and clumped distribution of the Tibetan Antelope complicate extrapolation and calculation of accurate population estimates, but all recent Chinese sources agree that the population has been increasing. The species was recently assessed as Near Threatened in the Chinese Red List of Vertebrates (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2016).",Increasing,"This antelope formerly ranged across the whole Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Almost its entire range lies within China. A small number occur seasonally in north-eastern Ladakh, in the extreme north of India and the species formerly occurred in a small area of northwest Nepal (Schaller 1977). Its range has decreased and it is now absent from most of the eastern plateau and from Nepal. The main stronghold of the species is in the Chang Tang area of north-western Tibet (Schaller 1998).","Chiru have long been hunted for their underfur - shahtoosh (Wright and Kumar 1997), which is renowned for its quality and which has traditionally been transported to Srinagar in Kashmir, where it is woven into an extremely fine fabric used to make shawls; a traditional wedding gift in India and Pakistan. However it takes 3-5 hides to make a single shawl, and the wool cannot be sheared or combed, so to collect the fur the animals have to be killed (Leslie and Schaller 2008). This hunting escalated to a commercial scale in the late 1980s and 1990s, when according to the Chinese government, about 20,000 Chirus were hunted annually, primarily for their shahtoosh. Strict controls were introduced in China in the early 1990s, and the trade was also banned in India. Trade has been severely curtailed, though not completely eliminated, due to high demand and high prices: within India, shawls are worth $1,000-$5,000, internationally the price can reach as high as $20,000. Horns of the males were traditionally used as gun rests, and to a limited extent in traditional Chinese medicine.",Terrestrial,"The Chiru is legally protected in China and India (Wright and Kumar 1997, Schaller 1998), but enforcement of the law over the vast area of its habitat has been problematic, although efforts have intensified since the early 1990s (Zhen 1999). Public awareness of the Chiru within China has increased, and some populations have begun to respond (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 2003). Chiru occur in Qiantang (300,000 km²<sup></sup>), Kekexili (45,000 km²<sup></sup>), Arjin Shan (45,000 km<sup>²</sup>), Sanjiangyuan (150,000 km²<sup></sup>) National Nature Reserves and West Kunlun (30,000 km²<sup></sup>) and Central Kunlun (32,000 km²<sup></sup>) provincial nature reserves. This network of reserves is important to the Chiru due to its migratory behaviour, with about 75% of its migratory routes protected by this network. Since 2002, the International Fund for Animal Welfare has organized and sponsored an annual workshop for nature reserve staff and other officials from the three Chinese provinces where the majority of the population is concentrated (Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang).<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.<br/><br/>Chiru are virtually unknown in zoos, but young have been born and orphans have been reared successfully in a 200 ha fenced enclosure in native habitat (Leslie and Schaller 2008).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The subspecies <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> is abundant on both formally and privately protected land. A minimum population size of 54,426 mature individuals of <em>D. p. phillipsi </em>is estimated (using a 70% mature population structure) across 678 protected areas and wildlife ranches (counts between 2010 and 2016). There are at least an estimated 17,235 animals (counts between 2013 and 2016) on formally protected areas across the country. The population has increased significantly over three generations (1990-2015) in formally protected areas across its range and it is suspected to have also increased on private lands. Apart from hybridisation there are currently no major threats to long-term survival. The number of mature individuals of<em> D. p. pygargrus</em> is estimated at 752–1,618 individuals, but the number of pure Bontebok is unknown and the area of occupancy is limited and available habitat is decreasing.","<em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi </em>occur primarily on grasslands, especially open  plateau grasslands, characteristic of the South African Highveld,  extending to altitudes of up to 2,000 m asl (East 1999). They prefer  short grass and depend largely on the availability of drinking water  (David and Lloyd 2013). <em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> is very closely associated with  the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion. They are almost exclusively  grazers with a preference for short grass and recently burnt veld  (Beukes 1984, 1987; Novellie 1987; Kraaij and Novellie 2010). Water is  an essential requirement and they stay within 1.5 km of surface water  during the dry season.<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are adapted to unique  habitat and climatic conditions: the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion  receives some rain throughout the year but has a distinct peak during  winter with about 65% of rain falling between April and October. This  subspecies has thus adapted over at least 20,000 years to a climate of  wet and cold winters and warm and dry summers, the opposite to the  conditions experienced by <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> with warm and wet  summers and very cold but dry winters.<br/><br/>For further detail see the subspecies accounts.","The translocation of both Blesbok and Bontebok outside their natural range is a significant threat to the continued existence of the two subspecies, as hybridisation takes place and becomes increasingly likely. <br/><br/>The major threats for <em>D. p. pygargus</em> are hybridisation with <em>D. p. phillipsi,</em> the lack of available habitat within the natural range, low genetic diversity (probably the result of two bottlenecks caused by overhunting and disease; van der Walt <em>et al</em>. 2001) and poor gene flow between subpopulations. The overall management concern is the lack of a metapopulation management strategy for this subspecies.<br/><br/>Hybridisation is currently a priority issue in <em>D. p. pygargus</em>, but the extent of hybridisation in the <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> population is currently unknown and further research is required. Breeding of colour variants that may be associated with deleterious mutations may, if released in large numbers, reduce effective population size and can affect wild populations if carriers are released into formally protected areas.","East (1999) estimated there to be at least 235,000-240,000 Blesbok (stable or increasing), of which 97% occur on private farms and 3% in protected areas, and at least 2,300 Bontebok (increasing). <br/><br/>Currently, the total population of <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> is estimated to be at least 77,751 animals (2010–2016 counts) on 678 protected areas and wildlife ranches, equating to 54,426 mature individuals using a 70% mature population structure. On formally protected areas, there were at least 17,235 animals counted between 2013 and 2016 (EWT unpubl. data). <br/><br/>For <em>D. p. pygargus</em> the population in all formally protected areas and private ranches within both the natural and benign introduction range is estimated at 752–1,618 mature individuals. However, this estimate does not account for hybridisation which might reduce the number of eligible private subpopulations dramatically. Outside the natural and benign introduction range, there are an observed 4,857 individuals which are not included in this assessment as they are not considered free-ranging (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).",Increasing,"Blesbok is endemic to southern Africa. Historically, <em>Damaliscus pygargus pygargus</em> ranged across the Highveld grasslands of South Africa in the Free State and Gauteng provinces, extending into northwestern KwaZulu-Natal, and through parts of the Karoo in the Eastern and Northern Cape. <em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi</em> is endemic to the Western Cape, the ranges of the two forms separated by over 300 km (Skinner and Chimimba 2005).<br/><br/>Range and population were reduced by hunting in the 19th century but populations of <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> have recovered remarkably, especially on private land, and have been relocated across South Africa to regions both within and outside its indigenous range (for example, Power 2014). Formerly present in western Lesotho, but hunted to extinction before 1900 (Lynch 1994). Swaziland is outside the historical range, but extralimital introductions have occurred in Malolotja Nature Reserve and Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary (Monadjem 1998). The species has also been introduced to private game farms outside its indigenous range in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia (East 1999).<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are endemic to the Western Cape, South Africa, although introductions have been made in most provinces. Historically, they were confined to the coastal plain east of the Kogelberg in the Western Cape where they are believed to have concentrated on the renosterveld areas (Boshoff and Kerley 2001, Skead 2011). Extra-limital subpopulations have been established on private farms or ranches in at least the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West provinces, and there is pressure to increase the extent of introduction (Power 2014).","Used for commercial trophy hunting on a national and international scale, and by subsistence hunters for meat.

50649567,219,Acinonyx jubatus,Vulnerable,A2acd; C1,2015,2014-05-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The known Cheetah population is roughly 6,700 adult and adolescent animals distributed across 29 subpopulations. These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici<em>&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durant<em> et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003, Mills <em>et al. </em>2004, Cooper <em>et al. </em>2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall<em> et al. </em>2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker <em>et al. </em>2003c, Durant <em>et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir<em> et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis<em> et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe<em> et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al. </em>1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen <em>et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies <em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa,<em> A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel<em> et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for <em>A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase <em>et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This is a rare, small cat occurring in a remote area. Information about this species is relatively sparse and potentially out of date. No substantive advancements in knowledge about the species status and distribution have been made since the previous Red List assessment (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2010). Recent camera trapping, sign surveys and local community interviews within the anticipate Chinese Mountain Cat range (Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang), including the Second National Assessment on Wildlife Resources of China, have failed to reveal evidence of the species (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data). There is therefore an urgent need for surveys of extant wild populations to be carried out.<br/><br/>The taxonomy of the species remains unclear. <em>Felis bieti</em> was recently attributed species status by Kitchener and Rees (2009), based on morphology and potential sympatry with Asian Wildcat (<em>Felis silvestris ornata</em>). Genetic evidence has indicated <em>F. bieti</em> to be a subspecies of <em>Felis silvestris</em> (Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007), however, greater sampling and assessment of genetic materials from individuals living in the wild is urgently required to be able to draw firm conclusions.<br/><br/>As in the previous assessment (Sanderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), threats to&#160;<em>F. bieti</em>&#160;remain the same, principally accidental killing through the control of rodents using poisons and targeted hunting for the illegal trade in furs.&#160;There is an urgent need to assess the efficacy of current measures in place for the protection of the species, including the effectiveness of current protected area management to safeguard China’s only endemic felid.<br/><em><br/>Felis bieti</em> is assesed as Vulnerable on the basis that there are likely to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.

50652196,8542,Felis nigripes,Vulnerable,C2a(i),2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This assessment is based on the national Red List assessment for South Africa (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Black-footed Cats are endemic to the arid regions of southern Africa, occurring widely across the western reaches in a relatively restricted and patchy distribution. The historical paucity of data has led to inconsistencies and perpetuated inaccuracies in current literature, which in turn has affected the accuracy of conservation measures. The naturally rare, cryptic colouring, small size and secretive nocturnal nature of this species has contributed considerably to the lack of information. Black-footed Cats are known to occur at low densities and it is difficult to establish population sizes. The stronghold of the species is suspected to be in the central Karoo region of South Africa where highest densities are reached, whereas other regions are suspected to have medium or low densities. Using density estimates of 0.03 km², 0.02 km² and 0.01 km² for high, medium and low density areas respectively, we converted kernel densities to isopleths to calculate population size. Estimated population size is 13,867 individuals, of which 9,707 are considered to be mature (using a 70% mature population structure), where no subpopulation is suspected to comprise more than 1,000 mature individuals as the species is patchily distributed. However, defining subpopulations for this species needs further work. We also caution that these estimates will be confounded by uneven sampling across the range, thus leading to inaccurate density isopleths. This is a first attempt and should be refined as more data from across the range become available.<br/><br/>There is a general suspected continuing decline from to loss of prey base due to bushmeat poaching (especially Springhare <em>Pedetes capensis</em>), persecution (direct or incidental), road collisions and predation by domestic animals. Continuing decline is also inferred from a long-term study in Benfontein, Northern Cape where estimated density declined from 0.17 cats / km² in 1998–1999 to 0.08 cats / km² in 2005–2015. Additionally, <em>c.</em> 50% of radio-collared individuals are lost annually to a combination of natural mortality and predation from abundant Black-backed Jackals (<em>Canis mesomelas</em>) and Caracals (<em>Caracal caracal</em>). An emerging threat may be increasing interspecific competition, including intraguild predation, by overabundant mesopredators (for example, Black-backed Jackals <em>Canis mesomelas</em>).<br/><br/>Thus, we list this species as Vulnerable C2a(i), as population size is estimated to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, where no subpopulation is suspected to be more than 1,000 mature individuals, and there is an inferred continuing decline. We note that this is a precautionary assessment given the low density estimates used in the analysis, the lack of systematic field surveys across the range and the lack of a robust subpopulation definition. This species should be reassessed once such data are available. Key interventions include the establishing of large conservancy areas and sustaining viable Springhare subpopulations in areas where alternative refuge systems are unavailable.","The Black-footed Cat is one of the world's smallest cats, with females weighing an average of 1.3 kg and males larger at 1.93 kg (Sliwa 2013). The conspecific and more common African Wildcat (<em>Felis silvestris)</em> is considerably larger (females - 3.9 kg, males - 5.1 kg) (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Unlike most cat species, these cats are predominantly ground-dwellers and will not readily take to trees. They lead a solitary existence except when with kittens or during brief mating periods. Black-footed Cats are extremely secretive in nature. They are strictly crepuscular and nocturnal and are active throughout the night, even hunting at temperatures of -8˚ C (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997). During the day, the cats make use of dens. The species prefers hollowed out abandoned termite mounds when available (especially for the kittens), but will use dens dug by other animals such as Springhares, Ground Squirrels (<em>Xerus inauris</em>) and Aardvark (<em>Orycteropus afer</em>). It is a specialist of open, short grass areas with an abundance of small rodents and ground-roosting birds. It inhabits dry, open savannah, grasslands and Karoo semi-desert with sparse shrub and tree cover and a mean annual rainfall of between 100 and 500 mm at altitudes up to 2,000 m above sea level. It is not found in the driest and sandiest parts of the Namib and Kalahari Deserts (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats mate year round but with a distinct season from late winter (August) over the summer months up to March. Up to two litters a year may be produced, with one to four kittens (normally two) born after 63–68 day gestation inside a Springhare burrow or hollow termitarium (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997, Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Births are timed to coincide with rains and food availability. Kittens are independent after 3–4 months, but remain within the range of their mother for extended periods (Sliwa 2013). Whilst they are reported to live up to 16 years in captive situations, life expectancy in the wild is about five years (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data), although two monitored individuals lived at least seven years (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>As with most small cat species, Black-footed Cats are obligate carnivores. During a 6-year field study on the game farm in central South Africa, 1,725 prey items were observed consumed by 17 free-ranging habituated individuals (Sliwa 2006). Average prey size was 24.1 g. Eight males fed on significantly larger prey (27.9 g) than 9 females (20.8 g). Fifty-four prey species were classified by their average mass into eight different size classes, three for mammals, three for birds, one for amphibians/reptiles, and one for invertebrates. Small mammals (5–40 g) constituted the most important prey class (39%) of total prey biomass followed by larger mammals (&gt; 100 g, 17%) and small birds (&lt; 40 g, 16%). Mammals and birds pooled comprised 72% and 26% of total prey biomass, respectively, whereas invertebrates and amphibians/reptiles combined constituted just 2% of total prey mass consumed. Heterotherm prey items were unavailable during winter, when larger birds and mammals (&gt; 100 g) were mainly consumed. Small rodents like the Large-eared Mouse (<em>Malacothrix typica</em>), captured 595 times by both sexes, were particularly important during the reproductive season for females with kittens. Males showed less variation between prey size classes consumed among climatic seasons. This sex-specific difference in prey size consumption may help to reduce intra-specific competition (Sliwa 2006). In terms of interspecific competition, Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2010) found that Black-footed Cats captured smaller prey on average than African wildcats, although both captured approximately the same number (12-13) of prey animals per night.<br/><br/>Of 17 radio-collared Black-footed Cats (7 males, 10 females) studied at game farm at Benfontein Game Farm, Northern Cape Province from 1997 to 1998, the home ranges of adult resident males averaged 16.1–20.7 km² while those of females were 8.6–10 km², where male home range overlapped with females’ by 60–67% (Sliwa 2004). Despite this overlap, all individuals hunt solitarily. Similarly, annual home range sizes of black-footed cats were 7.1 km² for an adult female, and 15.6 and 21.3 km² for two adult males monitored at Benfontein Game Farm, Northern Cape Province from 2006 to 2008 (Kamler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).Since range size is dependent on available prey resources, in more arid regions these home ranges can be considerably larger. Both sexes spray mark, particularly during mating season when they are deployed in proportion to intensity of use and may play a role in social spacing (Molteno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998, Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Adults travel an average of 8.42±2.09 km per night – more distance than the African Wildcat (5.1±3.4 km per night) despite their smaller size (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).","Following 22 years of research effort by the Black-footed Cat Working Group, the threats to the species have become more apparent (Wilson 2016). Additional and previously unknown threats including, but not limited to, intraguild predation, diseases, declining Springhare&#160; populations and unsuitable farming practices have now been realised. All of these suggest that the species is becomingly increasingly threatened. New distribution data clearly indicate that the majority of the distribution occurs outside of formally protected areas (Figure 1 in&#160;Supporting Material). Indeed, the majority of protected areas are suspected to be too small to adequately conserve a viable subpopulation. Essentially, this means the conservation of the species relies on the cooperation of private landowners and managers, particularly in large conservancy areas. However, whilst the geographical distribution of the species may be greater than previously documented, the actual occurrence of the species is highly fragmented and patchy within this area (Wilson 2016), which may have resulted in the creation of island subpopulations resulting in limited dispersal opportunities and restricting genetic exchange between subpopulations. Habitat loss or changes have previously been considered the most severe threat to the species. Habitat degradation that results in the loss of prey base is a serious threat, but changing agricultural practices may, in some instances, actually benefit the species by providing artificially high rodent populations for prey and fewer apex carnivores to compete with.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most serious long-term threat for Black-footed Cats is the loss of key resources, such as den sites and prey, from anthropogenic disturbance or habitat degradation (for example from overgrazing). They are unable to create or maintain their own dens or burrows and rely on those made by other species. Thus, the localised removal of a sympatric species, Springhare or ground squirrels with whom they have a commensal (inquilistic) relationship, may be detrimental to their continued existence in a region (B. Wilson unpubl data., Olbricht and Sliwa 1987, Sliwa 2013). Springhares are often considered as a problem or damage-causing species requiring some control measures by farmers. Although a rodent, Springhares are long-lived with a slow reproductive rate and they do not recover easily from a severe reduction in numbers. In Botswana, the unregulated subsistence hunting of the Springhares for bushmeat has resulted in the eradication of the species in some regions (Butynski 1973, 2013), and with them in all likelihood the Black-footed Cats (Wilson 2016). Bushmeat hunting may be increasing in both scope and scale within southern African savannas (Lindsey <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/><br/>The impact of mesopredators may be increasing across South African rangelands (Avenant and du Plessis 2008). In general, numbers of Black-footed Cats and other larger carnivores are negatively related due to intraguild predation. Annually, the BFCWG loses about 50% of all radio-collared cats to larger predators (BFCWG unpubl. data). The BFCWG believes that the most vulnerable individuals (kittens and subadults – below 1 kg) are the more likely victims of predation but since these individuals are difficult to monitor (too small to fit a radio collar) the actual rate of loss is unknown.&#160; Similarly, during a study over 2006–2008 on Benfontein Farm, Northern Cape Province, two Black-footed Cats were killed by predation, at least one was from Black-Backed Jackals (Kamler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Wilson 2016) and another by a Caracal (Wilson 2016). Thus, although Black-footed Cats can co-exist with Black-Backed Jackals by using burrows during the day (see above for synergistic interaction) and also taking refuge in them at night during danger (A. Sliwa pers. obs.), and by partitioning activity and diets (Kamler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015), increasing Black-backed Jackal abundance caused by anthropogenic disturbance and loss of apex predators is likely to increase Black-footed Cat mortality. The BFCWG also has evidence of cats killed by traditional herding dogs and the popularity of Anatolian shepherd dogs with sheep farmers is potentially a new emerging threat (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats are also lost through indirect persecution, such as accidental poisonings (for example locust spraying, predator control lures/baits) and general predator persecution throughout most of their range in South Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sliwa 2013). Recently, there has been an increased interest for this species in the trophy industry as witnessed by permit applications and requests made to taxidermists (Wilson 2015).<br/><br/>The extent of road mortality on cat subpopulations is not known. The incident rate recorded in the Endangered Wildlife Trust road collision database is limited to a few records (W. Collinson unpubl. data). However, only 3% out of 790 locality records were road collision casualties (Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>Although an inherited trait, and previously thought to be limited only to inbred captive populations, Black-footed Cats show a high prevalence for AA-amyloidosis. (Olbricht and Sliwa 1987 and Terio <em>et al.</em> 2008). This is a disease characterised by fibrillar protein depositions in many organs as a result of chronic inflammatory processes usually culminating in renal failure. About 70% of the documented deaths of captive cats internationally are as a result of this disease. However, the presence of amyloid in free-ranging subpopulations was detected by Terio <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2008) from samples provided by the BFCWG. This provides additional evidence for a species predilection and supports the existence of a possible familial type of amyloidosis in the species. Habitat fragmentation and subpopulation isolation can only exacerbate this disease at subpopulation levels, whilst at the same time, the disease is a major reason why currently global captive breeding programmes are not self-sustainable (A.Sliwa pers. comm.). As wild subpopulations become genetically isolated, reduced genetic variability threatens population viability by increasing susceptibility to disease and reducing reproductive fitness. An additional consequence of habitat fragmentation and population isolation is increased contact with other carnivores and the pathogens they carry. Because Black-footed Cats share their territory, prey base, and infectious disease susceptibility with many small carnivores, and even domestic dogs and cats, this provides numerous opportunities for disease transmission (Lamberski <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats are also vulnerable to natural disasters such as flooding of dens and den collapses (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). The long-term effects of climate change cannot be overlooked and may lead to changes in range, changes in timing of breeding events, increases in severe weather such as flooding and droughts, as well as increased disease patterns or risks of the spread of pathogens from parasites.<br/><br/>Fortunately, unlike the African Wildcat, this species does not hybridize easily with other cat species. The only confirmed hybrid cases (Black-footed Cats and domestic cats) were under captive conditions (Leyhausen 1979). None have been recorded from the wild (A. Sliwa and B. Wilson pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Current habitat trend: Previously believed to be restricted mostly to panveld and short grass areas, Black-footed Cats occupy a wide range of open arid and semi-arid habitats where they favour any vegetation cover that is low and not too dense, where they have even been sporadically recorded on fallow agricultural fields and in extremely overgrazed areas (Wilson 2016). They are therefore not restricted by habitat throughout most of their distribution in southern Africa. However, overgrazing from livestock farms leads to bush encroachment which reduces the habitat suitability for their normal prey items. The species is highly adaptable and reports of individuals utilising open agricultural areas suggests that the cats may respond to seasonal fluctuations of rodent populations associated with sowing and harvesting activities. However, given the unpredictable nature of these events, and associated risks due to the proximity to humans and their domestic carnivores, the benefit to resident cats is uncertain.&#160; Also there is no research as to how these human-dominated landscapes are used by Black-footed cats and whether these specific records are due to the fact that they are exposed and highly frequented by human observers (A. Sliwa pers. obs.).","The Black-footed Cat is naturally rare compared to the other small cats of southern Africa (Sliwa 2013). Camera trapping for this species is particularly difficult due to secretive behaviour and small size. For example, in over 790 records, only one was from a camera trap (B. Wilson unpubl. data). Black-footed Cats move quickly and do not habitually use game tracks or roads like other animals. Since 2006, there has been extensive effort to establish the historical and current distribution of the species (Wilson 2016). Prior to 2000, there are only 251 specimen records including fossil specimens were available for the species. Since then, more than 545 records have been collected with an emphasis on locality data have been recorded. It is now clear that the species has been previously under-sampled. Throughout its entire range there are only <em><em><em><em><em>c.</em></em></em></em></em> 692 verifiable locality records which can be reliably mapped (Wilson 2016). As such, it is difficult to determine density, and thus a population estimate, for this species. High-density estimates come from two study sites at Benfontein and Nuwejaarsfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa with over 17,000 fixes and 1,600 hours of observation of radio-collared individuals (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010): For Benfontein, between 1998 and 1999, density (based on radio-collared individuals) was estimated at 0.17 cats / km² but only 0.08 km² between 2005 and 2014. For Nuwejaarsfontein, density was estimated at 0.06 cats / km² from 2009-2014 (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>, 2014). However, these two sites may represent exceptionally high densities due to favourable climate and human management, and low-quality habitat densities are probably much lower (Sliwa 2013). Thus, we suspect that densities of 0.03 / km² represent more realistic higher densities across larger scales and represent viable subpopulations in the long-term (B. Wilson and A. Sliwa unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Using these density estimates, population size was calculated by converting kernel densities based on verified records (both historical and recent) to high (0.03 cats / km²), medium (0.02 cats / km²) and low density (0.01 cats / km²) isopleths in ArcGIS across the entire range of the species in the assessment region. The population sizes from the density bands were then summed to produce an overall population estimate. The best estimate yielded an estimated 13,867 individuals within the assessment region, of which 9,707 are mature (assuming a 70% mature population structure, Table 1). These estimates were calculated from the range-wide heat map (Figure 1 in Supporting Material). See Supporting Material attachment also for more details on methodology.<br/><br/>Additionally, no subpopulation is suspected to have more than 1,000 mature individuals. However, the definition of a subpopulation for this species needs further work depending on dispersal rates and distances, connectivity and genetic subpopulation structure, although small home range sizes of the species – minimum estimate for females 7.1–8.6 km² (Sliwa 2004, Kamler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) – may suggest small subpopulation sizes. Unpublished data suggest dispersal distance so 20 km (A. Sliwa unpubl. data), and we suspect that clusters within 50 km of each other and distances of 100 km apart would separate subpopulations. This would mean a cluster within an area of 1,963 km² or 2,500 km² would yield subpopulation sizes of 334 and 425 individuals (using 0.17 cats / km²) respectively.<br/><br/>These estimates of course suffer from lack of consistent search effort and thus density zones may be confounded by field surveys that differ in methodology and single records may represent substantially higher density areas, reflecting the lack of field surveys conducted in the region. As such, population estimates are likely to be underestimates. This may especially be the case for the global estimate, as areas outside South Africa may be significantly under-sampled, although it is likely that these areas exhibit lower densities anyway (M. Küsters, pers. comm. for Namibia). Given that the South African core of the range is fairly well-sampled, the population estimate is likely to be more robust and the analysis represents a replicable first-step methodology that can be improved with further field surveys and ecological studies. It should also be noted that estimates of population sizes are sensitive to the relative size of the high-density clusters, thus a more conservative estimate would yield a lower population size, while a less conservative estimate would yield a larger population size. For example increasing the high-density isopleth to cover 70% of the records (up from 50%), yields a global population estimate of 16,853 individuals (11,797 mature). We also note that the density estimates used for the isopleths are precautionary and replicated studies in different regions should be conducted to properly calibrate the density bands.<br/><br/>There is a higher density in the central part of South Africa, along a North-South axis with decreasing frequency of records either West or East of this region and northwards in the range (Figure 1 in&#160;Supporting Material&#160;).<br/><br/>A decline is suspected over the general range, with only some central areas indicating stable subpopulations. However, it is difficult to demonstrate decline in a species that is so hard to census. Preliminary evidence for inferring a continuing decline comes from the long-term study area Benfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, where the density in years 1998–1999 was 0.17 cats / km² (Sliwa 2004), and over the past 10 years (2005–2015) was only 0.08 cats / km², which is documented in field reports (for example, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Local subpopulations may also be low or even absent in areas where Black-backed Jackals and Caracal are abundant due to interspecific competition, including intraguild predation (but see Kamler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015), which may be especially true of juveniles. About 50% of all radio collared cats are lost to larger predators (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data). The Black-footed Cat is naturally rare compared to the other small cats of southern Africa (Sliwa 2013).

About 50% of all radio collared cats are lost to larger predators (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data).",Decreasing,"Black-footed Cats have the most restricted distribution of any of the African felid species (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species is endemic to the arid grasslands, dwarf shrub, and savannah of the Karoo and Kalahari in southern Africa. The majority of the range occurs within the boundaries of South Africa, thinning out northwards into Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe (Table 1). The species is found primarily in Namibia and South Africa, but also Botswana (where there are historical records but only limited recent ones), marginally in Zimbabwe and likely marginally in extreme southern Angola (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>In South Africa, where the majority of research effort has taken place, recent records suggest range expansions in virtually all directions from previous literature (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2016.). It is unlikely that true range extensions have occurred but is rather an artefact of reporting bias as a result of recently increased citizen scientist reports combined with increased research effort (Wilson 2016). On the eastern side of its range, occurrence records are confirmed to just west of the Kruger National Park, into north-western KwaZulu-Natal, and new data suggest that the species occurs further south and south-westwards in the Southern Cape and more westwards in the Northern Cape than previously realised (Wilson 2016). The occurrence of the species in Swaziland (M. Reilly and A. Monadjem pers. comm. 2014) and Lesotho (N. Avenant pers. comm. 2014) is considered highly unlikely and certainly no records exist to date.<br/><br/>Apart from Addo Elephant National Park and Mountain Zebra National Park in the Eastern Cape Province, and SA Lombard Nature Reserve in North West Province, there appears to be no consistent sightings of Black-footed Cats in formally protected areas, despite considerable research effort and game drive reporting (Wilson 2016). This is likely due to unsuitable habitat or the presence of a higher density of mesopredators which increases competition and incidences of intraguild predation. They probably occur in Karoo National Park. However, further field surveys are needed to determine in which protected areas subpopulations of the species are resident.<br/><br/>The current extent of occurrence in South Africa is roughly about 930,000 km² (Wilson 2016). However, we suspect that area of occupancy is considerably lower, due to sensitivity to environmental disturbances and threats (Sliwa 2013).","The Black-footed Cat is accidentally killed in indiscriminate trapping, hunting (rifle and dogs) and poisoning events aimed at other damage-causing carnivores. However, as a protected species these incidents are never reported for fear of persecution (Wilson 2016). At least one specimen record reported to B. Wilson was of a Khoisan man in the Kalahari wearing a skin as part of a loincloth. He indicated that he obtained the skin from a roadkill from the neighbouring Botswana area. Similarly, there are anecdotal reports of skins in households in the central Karoo (M. Drouilly pers. obs. 2014), Also, one flat skin was obtained from a sheep guard close to Biesjiesfontein in the Victoria West area in 2012, likely killed by his hunting dogs (A. Sliwa pers. obs. 2012).<br/><br/>Applications have been made for legal hunting permits in the Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, but have never been granted. However, several South Africa taxidermists have acknowledged having mounted hunted animals (Wilson 2016), indicating that there is some interest in the hunting industry for the species.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, there was a demand for the species by overseas zoos and export permits were granted for cats to be caught and exported from the Eastern Cape Province. During further investigations, it was revealed that many of these cats actually came from the then-Cape Province (now part of the Northern Cape Province) (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997). More recently, it has become an acknowledged fact that this species does not thrive in captivity and the demand for wild-caught individuals has diminished considerably (Sliwa and Schürer 2006). Zoos now maintain and exchange animals between institutions. To increase genetic diversity in these captive populations, in vitro fertilisation attempts have been made using oocytes of a captive females and semen collected from a wild-caught male during annual field research trips conducted by the Black-footed Cat Working Group (Herrick <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010), but without generating a viable embryo. <br/><br/>Whilst even predator-proof fencing is not an effective barrier for black-footed cats, the effects of wildlife ranching are currently unknown and further research is required to conclusively determine if this land-use practice differs from other farming practices. Since larger carnivores are often introduced and managed, the presence of these is likely to have a negative effect on Black-footed Cats due to intraguild predation. This is perhaps the reason why this species does not occur in formally protected wildlife areas like South Africa’s Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Kruger National Park but may be reported in peripheral areas. Effectively, large areas of intensive wildlife ranching could amplify the island habitat effect that already prevents movements between subpopulations, further threatening the species. This hypothesis should be tested.",Terrestrial,"Black-footed Cat presence in formally protected areas remains low to non-existent, particularly in those large enough to maintain subpopulations, for example, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. It is unclear in how many protected areas they occur. However, the major Karoo protected areas – Karoo, Mountain Zebra and Addo Elephant National Parks – may each protect a small but not self-sustaining population. Hunting of this species is banned in South Africa and Botswana and it is protected across most of its range excluding Namibia and Zimbabwe (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Although the Black-footed cat has been recorded at least marginally in all of the South African provinces, the effectiveness of local protection measures remains in question.<br/><br/>Key interventions for the species include:<br/><ol><li>Judicious management of larger predators and mesopredators: this is a holistic approach that includes only controlling true problem animals, ensuring that fields are not overgrazed or overstocked so as to sustain natural small mammal prey, and reintroducing or tolerating apex predators to roam and exert top down influences on mesopredators. The effect should be to reduce unnaturally high mesopredator density. Improved sheep-farming practices (for example, synchronised breeding events, kraaling at night, and shepherd systems, lethal control of only proven problem mesopredators) should also be trialled.</li><li>The establishment of large conservancy areas to create viable Black-footed Cat subpopulations and facilitate ecological separation between Black-footed Cats and larger carnivores (Kamler <em>et al.</em> 2015). The fragmentation of suitable habitats and potential isolation of subpopulations makes the formation or maintenance of dispersal corridors important in the prevention of inbreeding and prevalence of inherited diseases such as AA-amyloidosis. Despite its small size, individuals have very large home ranges, and to conserve subpopulations and create corridors, the emphasis should be on the establishment of large conservancy areas with suitable conditions for the species. This is particularly important in areas where the prospects of a formally protected area are unlikely.</li><li>Similarly, conservancies and private lands with low apex predator density can be targeted as possible sites for Black-footed Cat stewardship.</li><li>Human activities that lead to habitat degradation and the loss of prey species need to be addressed, particularly in the Karoo region which is likely to be the remaining stronghold region for the species.. This should also be achieved by creating awareness to the presence and needs of the species among landowners to reduce accidental persecution, whilst providing information about the special needs of Black-footed Cats that would enable them to be actively involved in the protection of the species.</li><li>This may also include generally raising public awareness of the cryptic species and encouraging citizen scientists to submit distribution records through the promotion of citizen science platforms. This has been done previously with the use of posters created by the BFCWG requesting the public to report sightings of the species, the bulk of the data having been used to establish a more accurate geographical distribution of the species (Wilson 2016).</li><li>Other interventions can involve applying stiffer legal penalties to people involved in deliberate persecution of the species or illegally keeping or trading with the species. </li></ol>In the long-term, the creation of a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species as an interim or pre-emptive conservation measure should be investigated which could be linked to the already existing international and national <em>ex situ</em> management plans. Currently there is no consistent and self-sustaining breeding and survival of cats in South African facilities and some only maintain their stocks by receiving rescued/confiscated individuals from the wild. We suggested the establishment of a national breeding studbook for Black-footed Cats, which would then allow a better overview on the stocks, which could then also feed to the international studbook, maintained by Wuppertal Zoo in Germany since 1991.<br/><br/><strong>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:</strong><br/><br/>Currently, there are no conservation plans for Black-footed Cats and the urgency to create such plans is undermined by the paucity of data at a national level. It is anticipated the numbers will decrease over the next 20 year period, but during this period, available data should give a clear picture as to the areas of range that are most affected, and the best possible interventions needed.<br/><ul><li>Currently, at an international level, due to its already low numbers, it is one of the species listed in the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Plan program developed in 1981. However, the as-yet undetermined subspecies status (<em>Felis n. nigripes</em> and <em>F. n. thomasi</em>) may undermine and place in jeopardy the international holdings and <em>ex situ</em> management strategies for the species as a whole. A number of zoo have captive individuals and an international stud book is maintained for the species. Success in captive conditions is fraught by failure of individuals to thrive due to their highly specialised needs and the effects of inbreeding and/or AA-amyloidosis. Thus, <em>ex situ</em> conservation efforts are not recommended.</li><li>Translocation of individuals without the monitoring of the released cats to determine survival rates is not advocated or advised as displaced individuals may suffer a high mortality rate. Systematic monitoring in areas identified as under-sampled should be established to improve population estimates and scan for stewardship sites.</li><li>The presence/absence of the species in formally protected areas must be ascertained.<br/></li></ul><strong>Research priorities:<br/></strong><br/>The Black-footed Cat has been extensively studied for more than 20 years near the Kimberley area, along the Free State-Northern Cape border. The Black-footed Cat Working Group focuses on the ecology, reproductive biology, geographical range, habitat preferences, health and conservation of the species. This provided information about the diet (Sliwa 2006, Sliwa <em>et al.</em> 2010), home range size and social organization (Sliwa 2004), ecological relationships between the species and other sympatric carnivores (Kamler <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160; More recently, the BFCWG extended this study to include farms south of De Aar, Northern Cape Province in a different habitat type with different farming practices in place. However, there is little information for elsewhere within its range and the following are considered research priorities:<br/><br/>Fine-scale distributional studies across the distributional range. This will hopefully lead to more accurate subpopulation estimates. Long-term monitoring of subpopulation trends are also needed throughout the species’ geographic range, particularly in ecologically distinct areas and under varying farming practices. Kitten mortality and survival rates also need to be quantified.<br/><br/><ul><li>Similarly, studies on changes in density across a spectrum of habitat quality are needed to refine conservation plans and subpopulation estimates. Fine-scale determination on what habitat characteristics and prey populations are required for female Black-footed Cats to successfully raise their kittens is also needed. </li></ul>The impacts and extent of persecution (both direct and indirect) and the efficacy of education and awareness programmes targeted at landowners.<br/><br/>Genetic investigation into the subspecies status is needed as the results may have conservation implications.<br/><ul><li>Investigation into causes and extent of AA-amyloidosis in wild populations.</li><li>The effects of Black-backed Jackals and Caracals, and possibly other apex carnivores, need to be quantified.</li><li>The degree of inquilism and dependence on Springhares burrow systems for refuge, and thus long-term survival of cats following of the removal of Springhare subpopulations, needs to be determined.</li><li>Studies into the dispersal abilities and survival of subadult Black-footed Cats in different habitats. Effects of electric fences on local movements and dispersal patterns must be understood to assess the effects of long-term geographical isolation on subpopulation structure. This will enable us to define and delineate subpopulations more accurately.</li><li>Monitoring of the success of re-introduced individuals into new areas with/without other individuals present.</li><li>The range and impact of transmittable diseases from sympatric carnivores on Black-footed Cats.</li><li>The numbers of Black-footed Cats being removed for the trophy industry.<br/></li></ul>Other research projects include:<br/><ul><li>WAZA Conservation Project 06016 - Cologne Zoo(Germany), McGregor Museum (Kimberley, South Africa), San Diego Zoo Safari Park (USA), Wuppertal Zoo (Germany) - <a href=""http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/overview/blackfooted-cat-research"">http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/overview/blackfooted-cat-research</a></li><li>Distribution and Conservation Status of the Black-Footed Cat Felis nigripes in Namibia <a href=""http://www.rufford.org/projects/martina_kusters"">http://www.rufford.org/projects/martina_kusters</a>.

50652361,60354712,Felis silvestris,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>               The Wild Cat is the most common and widely distributed wild felid, and thus listed as Least Concern. However, introgressive hybridization with domestic cats is considered extensive, and taking place across almost the entire range, potentially resulting in cryptic extirpations of some populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2011). Although detailed information concerning introgression is not available for most parts of its distribution, based on less biased samplings, local introgression rate is estimated &#160;20% in Swiss Jura (Nussberger <em>et al.</em> 2014), 36% in France (Say <em>et al.</em> 2012), and 43% in west Germany (Hertwig <em>et al.</em> 2009), and 46% of wild-living cats in France may belong to a non-Wild Cat group (Say <em>et al.</em> 2012), whilst the figure may be as high as 88% in Scotland (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005). However, introgression may be evaluated differently in each of these studies, making comparisons problematic. Even less information is available to assess temporal changes in introgression rates. Future research on hybridization levels and fitness consequences of introgression may warrant a reassessment of the Wild Cat as a threatened species, owing to population declines of the Wild Cat.</p>","Wildcats are found in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts and scrub grassland to dry and mixed forest; absent only from rainforest and coniferous forest. European wildcats are primarily associated with forest and are found in highest numbers in broad-leaved or mixed forests with low population densities of humans. They are also found in Mediterranean maquis scrubland, riparian forest, marsh boundaries and along sea coasts. Areas of intensive cultivation and urbanisation are avoided. Wildcats in Africa are found everywhere outside tropical rainforest, although thinly distributed in true desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Asian Wildcats range up to 2,000 - 3,000 m in mountainous areas with sufficient vegetation, but are most typically associated with scrub desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/> <br/> Rodents and lagomorphs are the staple of the Wildcat's diet across its range, with birds of secondary importance, although a variety of small prey is taken, and wildcats also scavenge (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/> <br/> Phelan and Sliwa (2006) found large home ranges (52.7 km² for a radio-collared female) in desert in the United Arab Emirates, larger than home ranges reported elsewhere in more optimal haibtat – 6 - 10 km² for females in South Africa's Kalahari Gemsbok National Park (Herbst and Mills 2005 in Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2013) and 1 - 2 km² for females in Scotland and France (Stahl <em>et al.</em> 1988, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004).","Wild Cats are most threatened by domestic cats. Although the lack of information, especially outside Europe, prevents us from drawing a general conclusion, hybridization is considered widespread; there may be very few Wild Cat populations remaining where there is little history of hybridization with the domestic cat (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004, Phelan and Sliwa 2006, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007). Feral domestic cats also compete with Wild Cats for prey and space, and there is a high potential for disease transmission between domestic cats and Wild Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 1996, Daniels <em>et al.</em> 1999, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/> <br/> Other threats include significant human-caused mortality, in Europe, especially road kills (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lüps <em>et al.</em> 2002, Schulenberg 2005). The species is still considered a pest in Scotland and is illegally persecuted (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004). Predator control measures in a number of European countries may result in this species being killed as bycatch, e.g. snaring and lamping in Scotland. Wild Cats are also killed as pests in southern Africa, although this does not seem to have resulted in population declines (Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the past Asian Wild Cats were trapped in large numbers for their fur, although at present there is little international trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/> <br/> Historically, habitat loss led to dramatic declines in Europe and Russia in the 18<sup>th</sup> to mid-20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004). However, Wild Cats can do well in cultivated landscapes, which increase rodent population densities (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although these are the areas where hybridization with domestic cats occurs and spreads.","<p>The world's population of domestic cats, <em>Felis catus</em>, was estimated as c. 600 million (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2010), making the domesticated descendant of <em>Felis silvestris</em> one of the world's most numerous animals. However, domestic cats hybridise readily with Wildcats, and genetic analysis of “wildcat” samples found that most populations showed evidence of hybridisation (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are probably very few, if any, “wildcat” populations which have little history of hybridisation with domestic cats. This introgression with domestic cats makes an estimation of Wildcat population size very difficult even in comparison to other similarly elusive wild felids. Morphological criteria and genetic markers have been developed that should help to resolve these problems (Schauenberg 1969, 1977, Randi and Ragni 1986, 1991, French <em>et al.</em> 1988, Beaumont <em>et al.</em> 2001, Reig <em>et al. </em>2001, <span lang=""EN-US"">Pierpaoli&#160; <em>et al. </em>2003<em>, </em>Yamaguchi <em>et al</em>. 2004a,b, Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2011, Platz <em>et al.</em> 2011, Nussberger <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2014, Devillard <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> In the Near East region, Wildcats occur at low population densities, and are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation as well as hybridisation with domestic cats (Phelan and Sliwa 2006).<br/> <br/> Most detailed population information is available about the European subspecies, <em>F.s. silvestris</em>, although there is still a lack of information regarding its current status and population trends. There have been no recent large-scale surveys or European regional reviews of the status of the species (Macdonald <em>et al. </em>2004). During the European Mammal Assessment process (IUCN 2007), information (ranging from detailed national surveys to expert opinion) was collated for a number of European range states and is presented below, but this is by no means a comprehensive review. A review of the status of the Wildcat in Europe in the 1980s and early-mid 1990s can be found in Stahl and Artois (1991) and Nowell and Jackson (1996).<br/> <br/> <strong>Scotland (UK)</strong>: Recent estimates have varied between 1,000 and 4,000 (compared to 1.2 million feral cats in Britain), but as few as 400 cats which meet morphological and genetic criteria for being the furthest from the domestic group may survive (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004, Battersby 2005, Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005, Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2010). If so, this population would be Critically Endangered (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005). A survey of mostly sightings from 2006-2008 confirmed that the overall distribution had changed little from the late 1980s, with most frequent sightings in eastern and central Scotland and a small area of the West (Davis and Gray, 2010).</p>  <p><strong>Portugal</strong>: The population is suspected to be decreasing (M. Fernandes pers. comm. 2006). Considered Vulnerable at the national level, on the basis of suspected declines reaching 30% over three generations in the past or future (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/> <strong>Spain</strong>: In some places it is increasing and others decreasing (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Considered Vulnerable at the national level, on the basis of suspected declines of over 30% over the last three generations (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).<br/> <strong>Belgium</strong>: Evidence from Wildcats found dead on roads indicated that the species is gradually expanding its range to the north and west. There are no data on population size (Libois 2006).<br/> <strong>Germany</strong>: The population was recently estimated at 1,700-5,000 individuals (Knapp <em>et al.</em> 2000). The population may be increasing and occupying new areas (M. Stubbe pers. comm. 2006, Hartmann <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p><strong>France</strong>: The presence of Wildcats was confirmed in an area of c. 155,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the north-eastern quarter of France and around the Pyrenees, but these two areas are separated by a wide zone with no wildcats (Say <em>et al.</em> 2012). Wildcats may have extended their range in France by c. 30% in the last 30 years, although a cautious interpretation is necessary (Say <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p><strong>Switzerland</strong>: Based on a systematic survey, about 220-1300 km<sup>2</sup> of the Swiss Jura region are occupied by about 160-930 wildcats (95% CI, Swiss Wildcat Monitoring 2008-10, Federal Office of Environment). Since 1970, wildcats have extended their range to the South-West and East of the Jura (ref. within Nussberger <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p><strong>Italy</strong>: The population densities on Sicily based on camera trapping are 0.28 – 0.93 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>, whilst an estimate based on individual identification using DNA extracted from scats estimated 1.36 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> (Anile <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012, 2014).&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/> <strong>Slovenia</strong>: The population is estimated (on the basis of population density and habitat suitability) at no more than 2,000; it is stable. Recently expanded highways possibly pose some threat in the South-East part of its high population density range. (B. Krytufek pers. comm. 2006)<br/> <strong>Poland</strong>: Estimated number of wildcats in Poland is between 100 and 150 individuals and estimated population density is 1-1.3 per 1000 ha (Okarma <em>et al.</em> 2002). The current distribution of wildcat in the Polish Carpathians, mainly along the borders with Slovakia and Ukraine, shows that the Polish population forms a continuum with Slovakian and Ukrainian populations. Together they constitute the northernmost part of the larger Carpathian population of this species. The species is decreasing and is considered endangered (EN) in the Red Data Book of Poland (Wolsa<em>n and Okarma</em> 2001).<br/> <strong>Slovakia</strong>: The estimate of the Slovakian population in 2000 was about 1,500 individuals (unpublished data of the Slovak Environmental Agency: A. Olszanska pers. comm. 2006). <br/> <strong>Serbia</strong>: There are large populations along the southern Danube (IUCN 2007).<br/> <strong>Macedonia</strong>: The species is widespread (IUCN 2007).<br/> <strong>Greece</strong>: The Wildcat is widespread in continental Greece with sightings in all forested areas and many wetlands. There are apparently more sightings in North and North-East Greece, where the population density seems to be higher. The population trend has not been quantified, but is believed to be stable. </p>  <p><strong>Romania</strong>: The population is estimated to number c.10,000 individuals, but this is not based on quantitative data (Red Data Book of Romania). <br/> <strong>Bulgaria</strong>: There are no quantitative data, but the species is considered relatively abundant (Spassov <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/> <strong>European Russia</strong>: the population size and trend have not been quantified, but there are thought to be large, relatively stable populations (IUCN 2007).<br/> <br/> In Scotland, 88% of wild-living cats may be hybrids or feral domestic cats (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005), and in Italy and Hungary the proportion of hybrids is estimated at 8% and 25-31% respectively (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003, Lecis <em>et al.</em> 2006). On the basis of museum specimens, the proportion of hybrids in Bulgaria was estimated at 8-10% (Spassov <em>et al.</em> 1997), but the extent of hybridisation may have increased since this study. The hybridisation rate was observed to be 14 % in Portugal (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008), 4 % in eastern and 43 % in western Germany (Hertwig <em>et al. </em>2009) and 36 % in France where 46% of wild-living cats may belong to a non-wildcat group (Say <em>et al. </em>2012). In Switzerland, the introgression rate was estimated to be 20%, with a migration rate of 0-0.043 domestic migrants into the wildcat population per generation and 0-0.017 from wildcats into domestic cats (95% CI, Nussberger <em>et al.</em> 2014). Wildcats of mixed origin have also been found in Belgium (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003). In general the genetic distance to the domestic cat is larger in the north of the range than in the south (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003) and introgression between Wildcat and domestic cat is less in Eastern European populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Outside Europe detailed studies on the extent of hybridisation are rare. Evidence of hybridisation has been found in southern Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2004b, Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2013) and North Africa (Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2013) although introgressive hybridisation between Wildcats and domestic cats may not be widespread in South Africa (Le Roux <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"The Wild Cat has a very broad distribution, found throughout most of Africa, Europe, and southwest and central Asia into India, China, and Mongolia. Four major intraspecific phylogenetic groups, or subspecies (following Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2007, Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2010) are distributed as follows:<br/><br/>Steppe Wild Cat Lineage<br/>The African Wild Cat <em>F. s. lybica</em> occurs across northern Africa and extends around the periphery of the Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea (Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2007), where it meets, and/or hybridizes with, the Asian Wild Cat (Harrison and Bates 1991, Heptner and Sludskii 1992). This extremely wide distributional range is accompanied by a very broad habitat tolerance, being apparently only absent from closed tropical forest. Although thinly distributed in true deserts, such as the Sahara, it occurs especially in association with hill and mountain country, such as the Hoggar. In North Africa it occurs discontinuously from Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and into Egypt. It has an extensive distribution across the savannas of West Africa from Mauritania on the Atlantic seaboard, eastwards to the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Ethiopia; southwards it is present in all East and southern African countries (Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2013), where it is replaced by the Southern African Wild Cat <em>F.s. cafra</em> (Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2007). At present the boundary between the two cannot be determined by available genetic samples, but morphological and biogeographical evidence suggests the break to occur in the southeast, in the area of Tanzania and Mozambique (Kitchener and Rees 2009). The Asian Wild Cat <em>F. s. ornata</em> occurs from the eastern Caspian into western India, and north to Kazakhstan, and into western China and southern Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Forest Wild Cat Lineage<br/>The European Wild Cat <em>F. s. silvestris</em> was formerly very widely distributed in Europe and is absent only from Fennoscandia. Severe declines and local extirpations occurred in Europe between the late 1700s and mid-1900s, resulting in a fragmented relict distribution (Stahl and Artois 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Piechocki 2001). It became extinct in the Netherlands, but may be recently expanding its range from neighbouring countries to recolonize the country (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Canters <em>et al.</em> 2005). It was considered regionally extinct in Austria (Spitzenberger 2005), but vagrants still occur and the Italian population is spreading northwards into Austria (Lapini and Molinari 2006). It is possibly extinct in the Czech Republic (IUCN 2007). It occurs from sea level to 2,250 m in the Pyrenees (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In some parts of the Wild Cat's distribution (e.g. Scotland, Stromberg in Germany) it is possible that, as a result of hybridization with the domestic cat, very few Wild Cats remain (Macdonald et al. 2004, Battersby 2005, Herrmann and Vogel 2005). Sicily&#160; is the only Mediterranean island populated by European Wild Cats; populations on other islands (including Sardinia and Corsica) are probably feral domestics stemming from Neolithic times (Gippoliti and Amori 2006, Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2010, T. Viago in litt. 2009, Mattucci <em>et al</em>. 2013).","In the past Asian Wild Cats were trapped in large numbers for their fur, although at present there is little international trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II (<a href=""http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php"">http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php</a>). The Wild Cat is fully protected across most of its range in Europe and Asia, but only some of its African range (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although effective implementation of protection on the ground may be a different issue. The European Wild Cat is listed on the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) as a “European protected species of animal”. It is also listed in Appendix II of the Bern Convention. It is classed as threatened at the national level in many European range states (IUCN 2007).&#160; The Asian Wild Cat is legally protected in Afghanistan, having been placed on the country’s first Protected Species List in 2009, which bans all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan. With so little information or data known on this species in Afghanistan, it is also proposed as a priority species for future study. <br/> <br/> The main conservation need includes 1) identifying “wildcat” populations where there is little history of introgressive hybridization with domestic cat, 2) investigating the effects of hybridisation on the fitness of hybrid individuals, and 3) preventing hybridization by neutering and removing feral domestic cats if necessary. Such efforts have been complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing Wild Cats from domestic cats, especially when introgressive hybridization with domestic cats is extensive (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2004). However, morphological and genetic methods have been developed, tested, and improved to resolve these problems (Schauenberg 1969, 1977, Randi and Ragni 1986, 1991, French <em>et al.</em> 1988, Beaumont <em>et al.</em> 2001, Reig <em>et al. </em>2001, Pierpaoli&#160; <em>et al. </em>2003<em>, </em>Yamaguchi <em>et al</em>. 2004a,b, Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2005, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2011, Platz <em>et al.</em> 2011, Nussberger <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2014, Devillard <em>et al.</em> 2014), and to save the Wild Cat from cryptic extinction before it is too late",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50653881,54012637,Leopardus tigrinus,Vulnerable,A2c,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> has recently been split into two species:<em> L. tigrinus </em>and <em>L. guttulus</em> (Trigo <em>et al. </em>2013a). The present concept applies only to the former, distributed from North Eastern Brazil through the majority of northern South America to what seem as disjunct populations in Panama and the Central Cordillera of Costa Rica (Hunter and Barrett 2011, Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013a). <em>L. tigrinus</em> and <em>L. guttulus </em>show no evidence of ongoing gene flow, whereas <em>L. tigrinus</em> and Pampas cat (<em>L. colocolo</em>) have not developed complete intrinsic reproductive barriers, which has allowed them to hybridize (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as <em>L. t. oncilla</em> also represents a different species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999, Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2008). <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> is widespread and rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and mist forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannas and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno<em> et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, densities are also very low, typically around 0.01–0.05/km<sup>2</sup> (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, 2013). In the Amazon, the species' occurrence might be marginal and restricted to some small isolated enclaves. The Northern Tiger Cat was absent from all of the extensive camera-trap studies that totalled 56,837 trap-days throughout all of the Amazon Basin and was considered the rarest carnivore there (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. unp. data). Abundance estimates of this small felid are lower than that reported for the much larger jaguar, puma and ocelot, and there is evidence suggestive of population fluctuations or declines of unknown reasons, in some areas, estimated at 10–40% (Oliveira 2011, unp. data). It has been suggested that high Ocelot population numbers negatively affect the Northern Tiger Cat population (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Probably most of the population of <em>L. tigrinus</em> occurs outside protected areas, and outside the Amazon basin lowland rainforest (Oliveira 2011), in habitats which are undergoing variable rates of loss due to habitat conversion to agriculture. Extreme examples include the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga (with losses of 50% or more depending on the source; Klink and Machado 2005, IBAMA/MMA 2011a, CI 2012) and the Brazilian Amazon (with deforestation of more than 20%/10,000km<sup>2</sup>/yr in recent years; Morton<em> et al. </em>2006) and an overall loss of 90% of cloud forest in the northern Andes (Bubb <em>et al.</em> 2004, Garavito <em>et al. </em>2012). Loss of habitats from conversion to agricultural lands is certainly its main threat to survival also in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the deforestation frontier of the Amazon basin. Other threats include retaliatory hunting from depredation on poultry and the skin and pet trade, competition and disease spread by domestic dogs, and road kills (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2013, Marinho 2015). There is also hybridization with Pampas Cat in central/northeastern Brazil, which may be a natural or anthropogenic process whose extent as a threat is unknown (Trigo <em>et al</em>. 2013a). If further taxonomic species splits are indeed confirmed, the sub-populations are to be even smaller.&#160;High rates of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation in Brazil (Klink and Machado 2005, Morton <em>et al. </em>2006) depict habitat suppression, not degraded habitat, which should reflect equivalent species population declines, for example. The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> and <em>L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup> of the total current available habitat (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many Areas; IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). A Population in semi-arid Caatinga scrub/dry forest mosaic area in Bahia State, Brazil, showed an observed abundance reduction of 25.9% from 2012 to 2015 (L. P. de Castro Meira, T. G. de Oliveira, pers. comm.). The decline of the Northern Tiger Cat over three generations was modelled with a maximum entropy algorithm for 52 <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em><span id=""yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466593628142_10605""> records in Colombia and 19 bioclimatic variables and found a 12.7% population loss over three generations for the species (i.e. 15 years). The decline for Brazil, which holds the majority of the species range, was estimated at 36.8% in three generations (Oliveira et al. 2013, MMA/IBAMA 2014). Including a stable population for Central America the&#160;overall reduction&#160;is estimated to&#160;be 31.7%. The species is therefore classified as Vulnerable VU A2c. The overall range-wide population size is estimated to be less than 10-11,000 individuals, the species will continue to decline, and there is a lack of conservation actions destined to the species.</p>","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, from the lowland semi-arid Caatinga to cloud forests in the Andes. In Costa Rica the species is almost entirely confined to montane forests along the flanks of volcanoes and other high mountains from 1,000 m up to the treeline (paramo) and occupy cloud forest and high elevation elfin forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). Their distribution pattern in Costa Rica and Panama closely resembles that of the oak (<em>Quercus</em> sp.) dominated forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). While in Central America and parts of northern South America it may be most common in montane cloud forest, it is mostly found in lowland areas in Brazil, being reported from rainforests to dry deciduous forest, savannahs, semi-arid thorny scrub, in both pristine and disturbed areas. However, the species appears absent in the llanos but present from a few records from Rupununi savannahs in Guyana (Payán pers. obs.). In disturbed habitats, it can occur even close to human settlements, as long as there is natural cover and prey base (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2008). However, Marinho (2015) has shown that the species' occurrence is favoured by denser woody cover and distance from rural settlements in the dry Caatinga of northeast Brazil. Although it can be found in a few and localized areas of the Amazon Basin (Oliveira 2004), the use of lowland Amazonian forests is practically unknown and requires research attention. After an enormous effort of 56,837 camera trap-days, at 12 different study sites throughout the Basin, no record of the species was obtained (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> unp. data).<br/><br/>The Northern Tiger Cat is a poorly known small-sized (2.4 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.12 kittens (1–4) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is mostly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. However, it could also be highly diurnal in some areas of Brazil. <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> diet is still very poorly studied, but is known to be based on small mammals (&lt; 100 g; Trigo et al. 2013b), birds and reptiles (especially lizards). Limited data on home range shows that they are much larger than would be expected by its small body size. It ranges from 1 to 17 km² (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2010). Northern Tiger Cats are typically rare to uncommon, occurring at low population densities throughout most of its range, especially on what would be expected by a felid of its size. Densities are typically 1-5/100 km², but can reach 15-25/100 km² in a few and localized areas where ocelots are either rare or absent (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010). Its numbers/densities are strongly negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intraguild predator/competitor (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2008, 2010; Oliveira 2011).","The Tiger Cats were heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline of the Ocelot trade (Payan and Trujillo 2006). Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, disease, road-kill, illegal trade (pets and pelts), retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2008, 2013; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; Diaz-Pulido <em>et al.</em> 2013; Marinho 2015). By and large, the greatest threat is the rampant rate of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation. In the Andes cloud forests deforestation is mostly due to conversion to agriculture but also includes oil, hydroelectric dams, urban sprawl and road building (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, CI 2012). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, suppression to agriculture is by far the main threat. In these domains the rate is actually higher in the area called MATOPIBA (the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia), where it is twice as high as in the other parts of the country and which also comprises the main and most important area for the species (IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Oliveira 2011). Thus, populations in the core range area of <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>range are getting ever increasingly reduced and fragmented. Change in native species dynamics (predator/competitor) could represent another previously undetected potential threat (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2013). Hybridization with Pampas cat in all of northeast and central Brazil (the main range area for <em>L. t. tigrinus</em>) was detected in 100% of all specimens evaluated. This may be a natural or anthropogenic process and the extent of this as a threat is unknown (Trigo<em> et al.</em> 2013a), but would probably already compromise about 70-80% of the entire species population, or even more. This high level of hybridization is unheard of for any extant cat species.","Relative abundance and estimated population densities vary greatly, and the northern<em> Leopardus tigrinus </em>is less abundant than the southern <em>Leopardus guttulus </em>and also the rarest of the tropical species of Neotropical cat (Oliveira 2011). <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>is rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and cloud forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannahs and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Amazon, density is very low, expected at approximately 0.01/100 km². Camera-trap surveys in other portions of its range indicate that the species generally occurs in densities between 1-5/100 km² or lower (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2010, 2013). In Central America the species rarely shows up in camera traps even where they are known to occur, suggesting that they either avoid traps or are naturally rare and elusive in that area (Schipper pers. comm.). A similar trend is also found in several areas in Brazil, where authors found it in most areas in intrinsically low numbers, and apparently those numbers are not owed to camera-trap shyness (Oliveira pers. comm.). The species was absent from all extensive camera-trap studies in the llanos of Colombia and all of the Amazon, depicting its extreme rarity there (Oliveira, Payán pers. comm.). The Northern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit possibly due to the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). It seems that where Ocelots are rare or absent the average population density of tiger cats ranges from 5-20 ind./100 km² but expected to be much lower than 5/100 km² where Ocelots are present (high density estimates, ca. 20/100 km², are obtained only in very few and isolated areas) (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> is classified as Vulnerable in Colombia (MAVDT 2005, Rodriguez-Mahecha<em> et al. </em>2006) and as Endangered in Brazil (IBAMA/MMA 2014). The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> and<em> L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km²&#160;of the total current available habitat (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>submitted, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many areas) (IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). Extrapolated population estimation based on the above distribution estimates and also estimated densities (0.01/km²), results in an expected total population size ranging from 8,932 to 10,208 adult individuals. Decline based on deforestation rates of the species’ habitat is certainly above 10% over the next decades (Morton <em>et al.</em> 2006, Mulligan 2010, Garavito<em> et al.</em> 2012). It seems that the savannahs of Mirador State Park and the complex of protected areas around Nascentes do Rio Parnaíba National Park in the Brazilian mid-north and the Andean protected areas in Colombia are the most important areas for the species conservation (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2014; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011).",Decreasing,"The distribution range of the Northern Tiger Cat expands from Costa Rica and Panama in Central America into South America up to Central Brazil. Its southern limits are not yet well known, as well as the extent of a possible overlap with the populations of the Southern Tiger Cat (<em>L. guttulus</em>) (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as <em>L. t. oncilla </em>also represents a different species (Johnson <em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Trigo<em> et al. </em>2008). Additionally, it is also possible that the northern South American population, described as <em>L. t. pardinoides,</em> will also comprise a separate species (Nascimento 2010), or be together with <em>L. t. oncilla</em>. from northwestern South America a clearly distinctive species from <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). There are records from the Amazon basin, but the distribution could be discontinuous and patchy, and the species extremely rare (Oliveira 2004). <em>L. tigrinus</em> has been described as one of the rarest species in Amazonia, being absent in all of the 12 extensive camera-trap studies assessed along all of the basin. Its occurrence there might be marginal and restricted to some enclaves (Oliveira unp. data). The species is absent from the Llanos (Payan<em> et al.</em> 2007) and from the Darien Peninsula connecting Central and South America. From Ecuador and Peru only few museum specimens exist and only in 2000 the species was formally confirmed in Bolivia through live-trapping. Although the Northern Tiger Cat has been collected as high as 4,800 m (Cuervo <em>et al. </em>1986), this is probably an outlier, as there are very few records at or slightly above 3,000 m (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). However, in Costa Rica, in the Chirripó National Park, the species was recorded at 3,625 m (González-Maya and Schipper 2008).&#160;In Colombia it seems to be restricted to elevation above 1,500 m, however in Brazil most of the records were below 500 m (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008). It seems that the bulk of the species' distribution would be the cloud forests of Costa Rica for <em>L. t. oncilla</em>, at 1,500-3,000 m in the northern Andes for <em>L. t. pardinoides</em>, and the dry-lands of the Cerrado and Caatinga domains and adjacent deciduous forest in north-central Brazil for<em> L. t. tigrinus</em>. All other areas seem to be marginal for the species (Oliveira unp. data/in prep.). Although the extent of occurrence is rather broad, the actual area of occupancy (AOO) is considerably restricted, especially because large portions of the high Andes, or of the Brazilian Cerrado (ca. 50%) and Caatinga (ca. 46%) have already been suppressed and converted to agriculture-pasture, where the species is known to be absent (Klink and Machado 2005; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008; IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; CI 2012). Thus, based on and using the remaining available cover estimates as the expected AOO (and compensating for inclusion of unsuitable areas and the tiny fragments), should be somewhere around 893,200–1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup>, and is continually declining (Morton <em>et al. </em>2006, Mulligan 2010). Additionally, if the Northern Tiger Cat tends to avoid the more open formations and proximity to rural settlements as Marinho (2015) reported for the Caatinga and Oliveira <em>et al</em>. (2014) noticed for the Cerrado, then the ""de facto"" AOO should be even smaller.",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. Hunting of the species is prohibited in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Suriname and Venezuela (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the Amazon, field records suggest that, where found, populations are extremely low - therefore these areas should not be perceived to be safeguards for the species as it is for other felids (Oliveira 2004). It is likely that the species presents only a marginal distribution there (Oliveira unp. data). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of higher Ocelot <em>(L. pardalis</em>) densities, so that conservation of Northern Tiger Cat populations should rely mostly on private lands (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). It has been estimated that possibly only one complex of protected areas could maintain in isolation a minimum viable population of this species (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2008, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). Further studies are required on the species' ecology, demographics, natural history, and threats. This species needs to be evaluated at the subspecies level due to genetic diversity within the species. A reassessment on the taxonomy of this species is an urgent research priority as the northern portion of the population might be a distinct species (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50654216,11511,Leopardus wiedii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Margay populations are declining through much of its range due to human induced conversion of native forest habitats to agriculture, pasture and infrastructure development, and is predicted to continue at a rate approaching (but less than) 30% over the next 18 years (three generations), which qualifies it as Near Threatened. However, several populations are considered threatened. Although the species shows a large extent of occurrence, its area of occupancy is much smaller. In Amazonia, which is often considered a stronghold for the species, estimates suggest that Margay is not as abundant as previously perceived, but rather uncommon (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Additionally, Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelots (through ‘the ocelot effect’), which are fairly abundant and the dominant felid species in most areas of tropical America, including protected areas (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, Margay conservation would concentrate outside protected areas and likely only in Amazonia could long-term viable populations be sustained. In most areas <em>L. wiedii</em> is typically rare to uncommon, reaching densities around 0.01–0.05/km² (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Bianchi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). Over the next 10 years it is predicted that degradation of the Amazon by roads, hydroelectric dams, fire and deforestation will fragment and isolate remaining populations of its main stronghold. Habitat loss and fragmentation in other biomes of occurrence is also impacting the remaining populations, where the species is much rarer than in Amazonia. Protected areas outside of the Amazon are not expected to retain viable populations over the next few years (and likely do not at present) (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). This species will likely qualify for VU A3cde in the near future and should be periodically reviewed.","The Margay is strongly associated with forest habitat/tree cover, from continuous forest to small forest fragments in savanna ecosystems, both evergreen and deciduous, although it has been occasionally reported outside forested areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Oliveira 1998, 2011). It seems to be absent from the semi-arid scrub of the Caatinga domain in Brazil, with the exception of some evergreen forest enclaves (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). This species is thought to be more arboreal and better adapted to live in trees than other cat species. It is perceived as being a little less tolerant of human settlement and altered habitat than its close relatives, the ocelot and tiger cat. Nevertheless, Margay will use highly disturbed forest, abandoned plantations and other agroforestry systems which provide sufficient tree cover (J. Schipper pers. comm., Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Margay is a small-sized (3.3 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.09 (1–2) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Activity pattern is predominately nocturno-crepuscular, with very few records of daytime activity. Prey base consists mostly of terrestrial and scansorial small mammals, but lizards and especially birds can comprise important items at some sites. Larger medium-sized mammals, like squirrels, rabbits, agoutis, and small monkeys are also taken, but to a lesser extent. The average prey size is around 250 g. Although Margay has high arboreal abilities, it hunts mostly on the ground and most prey recorded are terrestrial (Oliveira 1998, Wang 2002, Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Bianchi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).&#160; Given its arboreal capabilities there has been a recurring myth that this cat is either scansorial or arboreal. It indeed possesses several unique arboreal skills, but that does not necessarily make it arboreal per se. In fact, evidence is highly suggestive of terrestrial locomotion and hunting, but nevertheless with resting time notably up in trees (Oliveira 1998, Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The limited information on home range size varies from 1 to 20 km² (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Home range reported for Mexico was 4.1 km² for four males and 1 km² for a female (Carvajal-Villarreal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). The Margay occurs at low population densities throughout most of its range, and its numbers/densities are negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intra-guild predator/competitor (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).","The Margay has been one of the most heavily exploited Latin American cats decades ago. Margays began to appear in international trade at a time of concern over the level of exploitation of the Ocelot, and species of spotted cats in trade were rarely verified. Illegal hunting for domestic markets or for the underground skin trade has been reported to be a continuing a problem in some areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, roads, illegal trade (pets and pelts - animals sometimes enter the pet trade), and retaliatory killing (animals are often shot due to depredation on poultry). Populations, especially outside the Amazon basin, are severely fragmented and are being reduced by habitat conversion to plantations and pasture. The species is susceptible to disease outbreaks (in Tamaulipas, Mexico there is an ongoing threat from disease). In Brazil, populations of the Atlantic forest are more threatened than those of the Amazon (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).","This species is predominantly uncommon to rare throughout its range (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). In general, Margays occur at densities of 1-5 ind./100 km², but have been estimated as high as 15-25 ind./100 km² in a very few and highly localized areas (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Where Ocelots co-occur in densities &gt;10 ind./100 km², Margay densities are expected to be much lower than 5 per 100 km² (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). The Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit outside the Amazon basin possibly due to the “ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, viable populations are expected to occur mostly outside protected areas or where Ocelot numbers are low. With the exception of the Amazon mega-reserves, it is not expected to be adequately protected anywhere else. Margays are undergoing a continuing decline due primarily to habitat loss to deforestation (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007). Considered Vulnerable in Brazil (Tortato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) and Argentina (Diaz and Ojeda 2000), Near Threatened in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), Threatened in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2002), and in Costa Rica (MINAE).",Decreasing,"The Margay ranges from the tropical lowlands of Mexico south through Central America and the Amazon basin to southern Brazil and Paraguay (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its southernmost limits reaches northeastern Argentina, north-central Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil and northern Uruguay along riverine forest (Dotta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Tortato <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Its occurrence in the northeastern part of Brazil is restricted to the Atlantic Forest domain (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Tortato <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). It generally occurs from 0-1,500 m, however, it has rarely been recorded up to 3,000 m in the Andes (Oliveira 1994).

Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, likely because of the impact of the higher ocelot densities, thus conservation efforts should concentrate outside protected areas (Oliveira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Oliveira 2011).

50655874,12521,Lynx rufus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bobcat is listed as Least Concern because it is abundant and wide-ranging and is not suspected to be declining at a rate that would qualify it for Near Threatened. Bobcats are widely-distributed and their current range consists of most of the United States, southern Canada, and Mexico where the state of Oaxaca remains the southern-most limit for the species. However, local threats may present challenges for long term persistence in some regions including market hunting for the fur trade, direct habitat loss caused by increased urbanization, and indirect effects of urbanization such as genetic isolation and lethal/sublethal exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (southern California). Florida is the only US state to report Bobcat declines with Bobcat observations decreasing dramatically as invasive pythons have increased in the southern part of the state. Additionally, some concern exists about sustainability of current bag limits with the increasing value of Bobcat pelts (West Virginia). Other local threats include possible disease transmission (canine distemper in Bobcats in eastern Canada), direct conflict with domestic/feral animals including feral dogs (northern Mexico), and poisoning and medicinal uses of Bobcats (central and southern Mexico). Bobcat densities are low in central and southern, compared to northern, Mexico. The recent discovery of hybridization between the Bobcat and the sympatric Canadian Lynx may result in conservation actions for the endangered lynx recovery.","In the US, the Bobcat ranges through a wide variety of habitats, including boreal coniferous and mixed forests in the north, bottomland hardwood forest and coastal swamp in the southeast, and desert and scrubland in the southwest. Only large, intensively cultivated areas appear to be unsuitable habitat. Areas with dense understory vegetation and high prey density are most intensively selected by Bobcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The requisite features of Bobcat habitat typically include areas with abundant rabbit and rodent populations, dense cover, and shelters that function as escape cover or den sites (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Mexico, Bobcats are found in dry scrub and grassland, as well as tropical dry forest including pine, oak and fir (Monroy-Vilchis and Velazquez 2003, Arzate <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, C. Lopez-Gonzalez pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/>Like its close relative <em>Lynx canadensis</em> the Bobcat preys primarily on lagomorphs (rabbits), but is much less of a specialist. Rodents are commonly taken, and Bobcats are capable of taking larger prey, including young ungulates (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A study in Virginia found Bobcats preyed on a wide variety of species (15 total) including squirrels, chipmunks, white-tailed deer, voles, and rabbits, appearing to switch prey seasonally as certain prey items became more available (Montague 2014, Morin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in review).<br/><br/>Bobcats in New Hampshire appear to favour areas with few roads, limited human development, high stream densities, and steep topography (Broman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Similarly, Bobcats in Vermont have positive responses to shrub, wetland, deciduous, and coniferous cover types, and negative responses to road and mixed cover types, and Bobcats prefer to move through forested land and scrub/rock cover rather than move through developed land cover types (Donovan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). The recently re-established Bobcats in Iowa showed a strong preference for forest over any other habitat type (Reding <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Tucker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In Virginia, Bobcats were also shown to occur more often father away from roads (Kelly and Holub 2008). So while Bobcats can adjust to some levels of human encroachment, studies support the preference of Bobcats for vegetative cover and water in areas away from roads. Bobcat populations have been shown to decline in areas where forests have matured and no longer support abundant prey, namely cottontails (Litvaitis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Additionally, in Texas, when in the presence of Ocelots, Bobcats selected areas with &lt;75% canopy cover, likely facilitating coexistence between the two predators and demonstrating the Bobcat’s flexibility in habitat selection (Horne <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Alternatively, another study has shown the Bobcat will expand its use of different environmental features and use of marginal habitat in the presence of Canada Lynx (Peers <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2009) gathered home range information from 29 Bobcat populations across the US and found that on average, males maintained home ranges 1.65 times the size of females. Female home ranges were 0.989–42.7 km² with a mean of 15.83 km² compared to male home ranges of 2.86– 167.9 km² with a mean of 39.70 km². Females demonstrated a strong positive association between home-range size and productivity (i.e. food availability), whereas males were influenced more by changes in size of female home ranges than by resource availability (Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009, Sandell 1989).","World demand for Bobcat fur rose gradually in the late 1960s and early 1970s and jumped in the mid-1970s after CITES entered into force, when the pelts of cats listed on Appendix I became legally unobtainable for the commercial fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013,&#160; $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. <br/><br/>The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana <em>et al.</em> 2010, Tracey <em>et al.</em> 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160; Riley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2009, Serieys <em>et al.</em> 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Croteau <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007). &#160;<br/><br/>There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi <em>et al.</em> 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton <em>et al.</em> (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani <em>et al.</em> 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne <em>et al.</em> 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers <em>et al.</em> 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (<em>Lynx canadensis</em>) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack <em>et al.</em> 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas.&#160; Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011). &#160;<br/><br/>In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010).","In 2010, Roberts and Crimmins surveyed state wildlife management agencies in each of the 48 contiguous states regarding the current population status of Bobcats. Populations were reported to be stable or increasing in 40 states, with six states unable to report population trends and only one state (Florida) reporting decreases in Bobcat populations. The total Bobcat population for the US is estimated to be between 2,352,276 to 3,571,681 individuals, indicating that Bobcat populations have increased throughout the majority of their range in North America since the late 1990s. In particular, Bobcat populations have rebounded in the Midwestern states in recent decades. Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Five Canadian provinces reported stable Bobcat populations, one reported a stable or increasing population, and one reported a fluctuating population. Bobcat population sizes and status in Mexico are not well known.<br/><br/>Despite being widespread, there are only a few estimates for the densities that bobcats can attain. Density estimates include: 57-62 / 100km² in California (Alonso <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), 48/100 km² in Texas (Heilbrun <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), 25/100 km² in Arizona (Lawhead 1984), &lt;9/100 km² in Idaho (Knick 1990), and 11/100 km² in Virginia (minimum estimate, M. Kelly and D. Morin pers. comm. 2015). Bobcat densities in the northern parts of their range are generally lower than in the south (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A density estimate for Bobcats in Mexico was low, at five individuals per 100 km² (Arzate <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Bobcat densities can vary dramatically depending on site and Thornton and Perkins (2015) found that densities in Texas were lowest in the most heavily modified landscape, and that Bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover.",Stable,"Bobcats occur in southern Canada and throughout the United States and Mexico. In Canada, Bobcats appear to be extending their range northward as forest clearing occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Recent confirmation of Bobcats via remote camera, suggests Bobcat range extends further into the Canadian Rocky Mountains than previously thought (Lobo and Millar 2010). In the United States, bobcats were thought to be extirpated by the early 1900s from several Midwestern states including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri, due to habitat loss and exploitation (Lariviére and Walton 1997), but they have recently recolonized these areas (Roberts and Crimmins 2010). Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Bobcats are found throughout Mexico, particularly in western Mexico and southward from the Sonoran desert. Competitive interactions with ecologically similar felids could be a factor in limiting their southern distribution, but similar competitors are present in other areas of Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Thus, the absence of<em> Lynx rufus</em> below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be due to the absence of prey species. However, confirmative data of Bobcat presence throughout Mexico is somewhat scanty. While Bobcat range is thought to stop at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Gonzalez-Salazar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), this is based on habitat modeling rather than verified confirmations. While generally favoring low and mid-elevations, in the western US, Bobcat have been trapped at elevations up to 2,575 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Mexico, radio-collared Bobcats were located at 3,500 m on the Colima Volcano in western Mexico (Burton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).","For information on use and trade , see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II. The Mexican subspecies <em>Lynx rufus escuinapae</em> was listed on CITES Appendix I until 1992, when it was downlisted to Appendix II on the grounds that it is not a valid taxon (Govt of US 2007). Bobcats are legally harvested for the fur trade in 38 US states, and in seven Canadian provinces. In Mexico, the Bobcat is legally hunted in small numbers as a trophy animal (Govt of US 2007). There appears to be little illegal international trade (Govt of US 2007), although within the US, Millions and Swanson (2006) used molecular forensics techniques to determine that skins reported as originating from an area with a higher bag limit were probably illegally taken from an area with a lower limit.<br/><br/>Bobcat status in the mid-western United States has improved since their extirpation in the early 1900s. In Iowa, Bobcats were downgraded to threatened in 2001 and are now harvested in many counties. In Illinois, Bobcats were removed from the states’ list of&#160; threatened in 1999 and they are now found in nearly all counties. Indiana has sightings in much of the state and Bobcats were downgraded to special concern in 2005. In Ohio, the Bobcat is still classified as an endangered species and provided full protection.<br/><br/>Reintroduction of Bobcats to Cumberland Island, Georgia was highly successful (Diefebach <em>et al.</em> 2013) suggesting Bobcats can do well when protected. In addition, Kapfer and Potts (2012) found Bobcat harvest in Minnesota could be predicted by season length and suggest population densities can be manipulated by change in length of hunting season.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
50657011,15310,Leopardus geoffroyi,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Geoffroy´s Cat is listed as Least Concern because it is widespread and abundant over most of its range. This felid typically ranks first in felid abundance in several habitat types such as the dry forests of the Bolivian Chaco (Cuéllar <em>et al.</em> 2006) and of the Argentine Espinal (Caruso <em>et al.</em> 2012), scrublands of the Monte (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2011), relicts of the natural Pampas grasslands (Manfredi <em>et al.</em> 2006), lowland cropland areas of the Andean subtropical forests (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2011), and grasslands of southern Brazil (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Its distribution range is considered to be continuous, but it does not occur in the high elevation areas (above 3,750  m) of the Andes. In the northern and central part of its range, this felid appears to have been favoured by the conversion of sub-tropical forests into croplands, while it seem to be tolerant to some degree of habitat alteration produced by livestock management. A recent expansion of its distribution has been documented in northeastern Argentina (Rinas <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, it is considered rare in Chile, mostly because of its limited distribution in this country (Iriarte <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Vulnerable in Rio Grande do Sul,  Brazil (Almeida <em>et al.</em> 2013). Anthropogenic mortality (e.g. road-kills, persecution due to poultry predation) is intense in several areas (e.g., Pampas grasslands) and potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia <em>et al. </em>2008, Pereira and Novaro&#160;2014). A hybrid zone between <em>L. geoffroyi</em> and <em>L. guttulus</em> was identified in southern Brazil where the two species meet (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2013b). These studies are currently indicating a possible natural origin for this event. In this case, this hybrid zone will be considered as an eligible process for conservation, by representing an important part of the evolutionary history of these species. However, specific studies are still needed to confirm this and evaluate whether anthropogenic influences such as human-induced changes in habitat or population densities in these areas could be influencing these hybridization events, and thus constituting a threat to these species by compromising their genetic integrity.","Described as occurring in a wide variety of habitat types of the subtropical and temperate Neotropics, including scrubby woodland, dry forests and savannas of the Chaco, Patagonian scrub, Monte desert/semi-desert, the Pampas grasslands, marshlands, etc. in both pristine and disturbed areas (Oliveira 1994, Pereira and Aprile 2012). It uses both open and closed habitats, but seems to be more associated with areas of denser cover in the predominately open areas of most of its range. Geoffroy's Cat is distributed throughout the pampas grasslands and arid Chaco shrub and woodlands, and up to 3,800 m in the Bolivian Andes (M. Da Silva pers. comm. 2014).  Most of its range is arid or semi-arid (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2006), but it also occurs in wetlands (e.g. Paraná River delta; Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2005).  It is not found in either the tropical or temperate rainforests.  It is sympatric throughout most of its range with the Pampas Cat (<em>L. colocolo</em>).<br/><br/>In a radiotelemetry study in wet pampas grassland of Argentina, Manfredi <em>et al.</em> (2006) found mean home range size from 2.5-3.4 km², with male ranges 25%  larger than females.  In Chile's Torres del Paine National Park, in beech forest, home ranges were larger, at 2.3-6.5 km² for two females, and 3.9-12.4 km² for five males (Johnson and Franklin 1991).  In Argentina's Lihue Calel National Park, Pereira <em>et al.</em> (2012) found male home ranges of 2-3 km²; whereas females occupied areas of 0.2-0.6 km². Home ranges in adjacent cattle ranches scaled up to 4.4 km² for males and up to 3.7-4.9 km² for females. During a severe drought  period in this same area, six radio-collared cats died of starvation when hare abundance fell from 5.6  to &lt;0.8 per 10 km (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Manfredi <em>et al.</em> (2004) found diet to vary by location in Argentina, consisting primarily of small rodent, but including other locally abundant species such as birds.  In Chile, rodents and hares were primarily taken (Johnson and Franklin 1991).  Plains Vizcachas are also prey (Branch 1995).  In southern South America, where Vizcachas have become extinct, introduced European Hares (<em>Lepus europaeus</em>) are the major prey, although densities of both hares and Geoffroy's Cats were observed to decline markedly during a drought period (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2006).  Fish and frog remains were found in the stomachs of Geoffroy's Cats from Uruguay and Brazil (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Bisceglia <em>et al.</em> (2008) found that small mammals were the most frequent prey of Geoffroy´s Cats in Lihue Calel, representing at least the 63% of the food items throughout the year. <br/><br/>Geoffroy's Cat is a small solitary felid (4.3 kg), with an average litter size of 1.5 kittens, and predominantly nocturnal activity pattern. It seems to be the most abundant felid of the temperate Neotropics (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Lucherini <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pereira and Novaro 2014).","Large numbers of pelts were exported from South America for the international fur trade from the 1960s to 1980s, but little trade took place after 1988 and the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix I in 1992 (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Cats are still killed as pests or poultry predators, and these pelts may be seen in local illegal trade. Currently, habitat loss and fragmentation, and retaliatory killing remains as the main threats. Potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia <em>et al</em>. 2008, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014)<br/><br/>During a health evaluation of Geoffroy´s Cats (Uhart <em>et al.</em> 2012) at two different protected areas in Argentina (Campos del Tuyu Wildlife Reserve and Lihué Calel National Park), antibodies to infectious peritonitis, feline panleukopenia, canine distemper virus, feline callicivirus, toxoplasmosis and dirofilariasis were found in tested animals. Adult parasites recovered from necropsied animals and eggs in fresh faeces revealed the presence of various nematode families, including Ascarididae, Trichuridae, Capillariideae, Rictulariidae, Spiruridae and Ancylostomatidae; cestodes from families Taenidae and Anaplocephaliidae and oocists of Eimeriidae (Beldomenico <em>et al.</em> 2005). These results suggest exposure (recent or past) to common domestic carnivore diseases, and indicate a potential risk to these Geoffroy´s Cats.<br/><br/>Human-related mortality accounted for most of Geoffroy’s Cat deaths recorded on cattle ranches near Lihué Calel National Park, with poaching, predation by dogs, and vehicle collision being the main causes of mortality (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2010).","It is relatively common throughout most of its range, although heavy commercial hunting pressure from the 1960s to the late 1980s is believed to have reduced populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species was recently downgraded from Potentially Vulnerable to Least Concern in Argentina (Ojeda <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is considered Rare in Chile (CONAMA 2009), occurring only in small areas in the south and east.  In Brazil, where the species inhabits only the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, it is considered Vulnerable (Almeida <em>et al</em>. 2013), although relatively common and abundant in the pampas (T. Trigo pers. obs. 2014). In Bolivia it is considered the second most abundant felid after the Ocelot (Cuellar <em>et al.</em> 2006).  <br/><br/>Density estimates include:<br/>Bolivian Chaco (Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park ): 9-40/100 km² (Cuellar <em>et al.</em> 2006)<br/>Argentine Monte (Lihué Calel National Park): up to 190-220/100 km² (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2011), including several transient individuals<br/>Argentine Espinal (altered dry shrublands): 45/100 km² (Caruso <em>et al</em>. 2012)<br/>Chile (Torres del Paine National Park) 7-12/100 km² (W.

50661611,18146,Prionailurus bengalensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread and relatively common species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although the island subspecies <em>P. b. iriomotensis </em>is assessed separately in the Red List because the population is small and isolated.&#160; Across its range, threats vary enormously by region, in the Western Ghats in India, for example, it is threatened by urbanisation (Seto <em>et al.</em> 2012), while in Viet Nam (Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2014ab) direct and indirect hunting are potentially causing large population declines. Across the majority of its range, however, this species appears to be stable and to readily use degraded forest (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2013) and even heavily modified habitats such as oil palm (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Yue <em>et al.</em> in press) and sugar cane plantations (Lorica and Heaney 2013). Consequently the Leopard Cat does not currently meet the criteria for any of the threatened categories. It is listed as Least Concern.","Leopard Cats can range up to 3,240 m asl (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010) and occur in a wide variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to temperate broadleaf and, marginally, coniferous forest, as well as shrub forest and successional grasslands. The northern boundary of its range is limited by snow cover, as the Leopard Cat does not occur in deep snow (but see Kerley and Bosienko 2013). It is not found in the cold steppe grasslands, and generally does not occur in arid, treeless areas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Leopard Cats occur commonly in dense secondary growth, including logged forest (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and have been found in Acacia (Giman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), oil palm (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Yue <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and sugarcane (Lorica and Heaney 2013) plantations. A camera trap study in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo found that both number of individuals and overall detections of Leopard Cats were higher in a small oil palm plantation with shorter distances to the nearest forest compared to a large plantation, suggesting that although Leopard Cats do use oil palm areas, forest habitat remains important (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It is still unknown how dependent Leopard Cats in oil palm plantations are on surrounding forest, or the maximum distances they will move into plantations, or even if plantations support stable populations. Leopard Cats can also live close to rural settlements. They are excellent swimmers, and have successfully colonized offshore islands throughout their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>From 20 radio-collared Leopard Cats in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) report mean home ranges of 12.7 km<sup>2</sup>, larger than that reported for other radio-collared Leopard Cats in Thailand (4.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) or on Borneo (roughly 3.0&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Rajaratnam 2007, Hearn and Ross, unpublished data) or Iriomote Island (Schmidt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) found no significant difference between the range sizes of males and females. They also found that habitat use was in proportion to occurrence. Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) report that Leopard Cats used oil palm plantations for hunting but forest fragments were important for resting and breeding. This was also seen in Sumatra, where Leopard Cats have been frequently recorded in remnant forest fragments in and amongst coffee plantations (McCarthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Murids have been shown to dominate the diet (Rabinowitz 1990, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Shehzad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Other small mammals, eels and fish have also been reported, as well as occasional scavenging of carrion (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Leopard Cat is predominantly nocturnal (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Lynam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), with crepuscular peaks in some areas (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) but some diurnal activity has been recorded (e.g. Saxena and Rajanshi 2014, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data).","In China, commercial exploitation has been heavy: hundreds of thousands of Leopard Cat skins per year were exported in the 1980s. Although commercial trade is now much reduced (Yu 2010) this species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution. In villages around Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, chicken depredation was frequently attributed to Leopard Cats, and commonly resulted in retribution killing of the species (McCarthy 2013). Island populations are small and seriously threatened in the Philippines and Japan. Leopard Cats can hybridize with domestic cats, as is shown by the popular domestic breed, the Bengal Cat although most of these exotic cats are now bred from Bengal Cat stock rather than wild crosses (TICA, The International Cat Association 2012). Hybridization in the wild has been reported, but is not considered a significant threat. Although this species is less dependent on forest cover than others, habitat loss and fragmentation is still a threat across most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) report population densities of 9.6, 12.4 and 16.5 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, from three selectively logged forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. They also found that population density increased with forest disturbance. A similar relationship with forest disturbance was found in the Western Ghats, India, but densities here were generally lower at 10.45 and 4.48 individuals/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;from Badhra and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserves, respectively (Srivathsa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Across most of its range the Leopard Cat is recorded more frequently than sympatric cats (e.g. Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Yasuda <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Gumal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014), especially in disturbed areas such as logging concessions (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), however, in some surveys leopard cats are recorded less frequently than other species (e.g. Pusparini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Loken <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), particularly in areas of primary forest (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Leopard Cats have also been detected in oil palm plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Rajaratnam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Yue <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press), however, fewer individual Leopard Cats were detected, and the detection rate was lower, in a survey of a large oil palm plantation, located at a greater distance from natural or semi-natural vegetation, compared to a smaller plantation, located close to natural vegetation, (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), suggesting that proximity to surrounding forest remains an important factor.<br/><br/>With a wide distribution and tolerance to human modified landscapes the Leopard Cat’s population is abundant. However, it is not invulnerable to habitat loss and degradation and this, coupled with hunting, is likely causing population declines in some regions (e.g. Seto <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Wilcox <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014a, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). In the late 1980s on average 200,000 Leopard Cat skins were exported from China (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although the actual harvest was likely much higher, possibly up to 400,000 (Yu 2010). Although the Leopard Cat is more tolerant to habitat disturbance than sympatric felids it likely experiences higher mortality rates in these areas (e.g. Rajaratnam 2000). Haines <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2004) report survival rates of 92% in a protected area compared with only 53-82% in areas with higher human activity. <br/><br/>Island populations are particularly at risk of extinction, with the Iriomote Cat <em>P.b. iriomotensis</em> listed as Critically Endangered, and the Visayan Leopard Cat <em>P.b. rabori</em> of the Philippine islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu and possibly Masbate listed as Vulnerable. The small population (approximately 100) on Japan's 710 km<sup>2</sup> Tsushima Island, considered the same subspecies as that which occurs in northeast mainland Asia, has decreased over the last 30-40 years (Izawa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). The population of the Western Ghats, India is geographically isolated due to a climate barrier and should be managed as a discrete conservation unit (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).",Stable,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread species. It is found through parts of India, west into Pakistan and Afghanistan (Habibi 2003), through the Himalayan foothills, throughout most of China, and north to the Korean peninsula and into the Russian Far East (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its range extends south throughout Southeast Asia, and includes the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Taiwan. The Leopard Cat is found on numerous small offshore islands of mainland Asia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It is the only wild felid in Japan, where it occurs on the small islands of Tsushima and Iriomote, and the Philippines, where it occurs on the islands of Palawan, Panay, Negros and Cebu, there are unconfirmed reports from Masbate but it is presumed to be extinct on Guimaras.<br/><br/>There are many recent records from protected and non-protected areas throughout its range examples include Borneo: Danum Valley Conservation Area and surrounding production forest, Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Crocker Range National Park, Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kabili-Sepilok and Gomantong Forest Reserves, and Tawau Hills National Park (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), Maliau Basin Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2011), Deramakot Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2009), Sabangau National Park (Cheyne and Macdonald 2011), Wehea Forest (Loken <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data), Upper Baram region of Sarawak (Mathai <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010), Sumatra: Gunung Leuser National Park (Pusparini <em><em><em><em>et al.&#160;</em></em></em></em>2014), Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), Singapore: Pulau Tekong (Chua 2013), Peninsular Malaysia: Endau Rompin National Park (Gumal <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Cambodia: Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Myanmar: Taninthary Nature Reserve and Hlawga Park (Than <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Thailand: Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Simcharoen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014) Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Lao PDR: Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014a), Nepal: Chitwan National Park (Lamichhane <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Makalu-Barun National Park (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010), India: Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary (Punjabi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014), Rajaji National Park (Saxena and Rajvanshi 2014), Bhutan: Royal Manas National Park (Tempa <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), China: Wanglang National Nature Reserve (Yu 2010), Russia: Zov Tigra National Park (Kerley and Borisenko 2013).<br/><br/>The range map of the current assessment is based on known localities, coupled with habitat (Hansen 2013), molecular and climatic data (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).","Leopard Cat skins are commercially traded internationally for the fur trade, primarily coats. Skins are also used as decorations in some parts of its range. Leopard Cats are occasionally kept as pets, sometimes taken from the wild and sometimes from captive breeding and they have been interbred with domestic cats, particularly in the West, to make the popular Bengal breed. Their bones are used in some traditional Asian medicines (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Leopard Cat populations in Bangladesh, India and Thailand are listed on CITES Appendix I, and all other populations are listed on Appendix II.",Terrestrial,"The Leopard Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II, and populations in Bangladesh, India and Thailand are included on Appendix I (as <em>Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis</em>). This species is protected at the national level over part of its range, with hunting prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Thailand and Taiwan, and hunting and trade regulations in place in South Korea, Lao PDR and Singapore (Nowell and Jackson 1996). This species is on Afghanistan’s 2009 Protected Species List, banning all hunting and trading of this species within the country. It is found in numerous protected areas. A clearer understanding of the Leopard Cat’s use of agricultural plantations and the effect of habitat disturbance is needed to better plan for its conservation.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50662615,18150,Prionailurus viverrinus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Recent surveys suggest that Fishing Cat populations are still in decline within all range countries at an alarming rate, particularly in Southeast Asia. A severe paucity of recent records in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Java, and, if the species occurs there at all, Lao PDR, indicate that these populations are very small, and have been since at least 2000. There are no recent records from Sumatra (Indonesia), where the species has never been confirmed to occur, although in the light of only limited appropriate survey effort in these areas, the species’s current status should be considered unknown. In South Asia, although relatively widespread, it occurs largely in human-dominated landscapes (often hugely so), which are under locally severe threat from urbanization (Sri Lanka and India) and industrialization (India). Estimates of population size and trend, and of extents of habitat, are very speculative, given that research on this species has been initiated only in 2009 (Cutter 2015). Yet, research reveals a declining population facing an array of severe threats from habitat destruction to active persecution due to perceived conflict (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cutter 2015, Adhya 2016). Poaching and retribution killing were the major causes for a high Fishing Cat mortality of 84% in Thailand, where 16 individuals have been monitored over a three-year radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015). <br/><br/>The current known global Fishing Cat strongholds are Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Bengal in India and the Terai-Duar belt of the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal. Habitat loss along with the killing of Fishing Cats because of conflict with local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside these strongholds, declines may be considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal are likely in the next 15 years (Ashan Thudugala, Anya Ratnayaka, Tiasa Adhya, Shomita Mukherjee, Murthy Kantimahanti, Giridhar Malla, Rama Mishra, Sagar Dahal pers. comm. 2015). These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a decrease of a further 30% in the global Fishing Cat population. Thus, the species is categorized as Vulnerable under A2cd+3cd+4cd. <br/><br/>The change in Red List category is a non-genuine change reflecting the very recent increase in information quality; it does not indicate an improved conservation status for the species since the last assessment.","In India the Fishing Cat is strongly associated with water bodies, marshlands constituting tall bed-forming graminoid species like the reed <em>Phragmites vallatoria</em>, the reedmace <em>Typha elephantina</em> and locally cultivated grass species like <em>Saccharum narenga</em> and swamps (Adhya 2015). Most known records are from the lowlands, but in Sri Lanka Fishing Cat occurs also in wetlands in hilly areas (Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is largely nocturnal (Mukherjee 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). It is a dietary generalist consuming a variety of prey such as murid rodents, birds and fish (Mukherjee 1989, Haque and Vijayan 1993, Adhya 2015). Two species of rodents that figured prominently in the diet of the Fishing Cat from the Howrah district of West Bengal, a rapidly developing urbanised zone, were <em>Rattus rattus</em> (sensu lato) and <em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>. A conservative estimate of rodent consumption by the Fishing Cat suggests that each individual eats between 365 and 730 rodents per year (Adhya 2015).<br/><br/>A radio-telemetry study on four Fishing Cats in Chitwan National Park in Nepal showed that they mostly used dense tall and short grasslands; the home ranges of three females was estimated at 4-6 km² while that of a single male was estimated at 16-22 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A more recent radio-telemetry study in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, demonstrated that protection of resources such as food and daytime resting sites and reduction of poaching can ensure the persistence of the Fishing Cat in human-modified agricultural areas (Cutter and Cutter 2009). A 84% mortality of radio-collared cats, due to poaching and unknown causes, was reported during the three-year study (Cutter 2015).<br/><br/>Generation Length (GL) was estimated at 5 years, using the Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) formula, GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], [where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3]; Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR), assuming 12 years as the average life span of the Fishing Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year.","The Fishing Cat faces a high risk of extinction throughout its range and is thought to be amongst the most vulnerable of the small and medium-sized cats in Southeast Asia, reflecting the very low overlap of occupied habitat with protected areas and other conservation interventions, rather than any particular inherent higher susceptibility than shown by the other small cats (e.g. Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The major threat across its South Asian range appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation by developmental activities such as urbanization, industrialization, agriculture and aquaculture (prawn and shrimp farms), whereas in Southeast Asia persecution is the major threat (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Willcox <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, Cutter (2015) reported 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats during the study period. Of 16 Fishing Cats that were radio-collared, three could not be located and could have either dispersed or died. Of the remaining 13, only two survived the almost three-year study period while five were poached and six died of unknown causes. Five dead cats were located. In one case the poacher who shot an animal reported the cause of death when he returned its ear tag. &#160;<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat comprises freshwater marshlands which are categorised as ‘wastelands’ under land use policies and are thus subject to conversion and degradation (Adhya 2015). Linked to this is conflict with humans, which is believed to be aggravated by habitat fragmentation and sharing of resources such as space (wetlands) and food (fish, goats, poultry) (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Kolipaka 2006, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Poisoning, trapping and clubbing seem to be common methods to kill Fishing Cats across the species’ range. A survey in West Bengal recorded 27 deaths of Fishing Cats between April 2010 and May 2011 in that year in the Howrah district (1,600 km²) (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Bangladesh, a compilation of reports from newspaper articles and web-based searches on the Fishing Cat (deaths, captures, rescues and releases) revealed 82 records and 30 confirmed deaths over a three-year period from January 2010 to March 2013 (Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In both areas, almost all deaths could be traced to local people killing the cats (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). It should be taken as the minimum number killed because not all instances are recorded. In the Sundarbans of India, local people from Sagar Island admitted to having exterminated the cat from their island (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2015) noted that in Bangladesh and India more than 70% of the deaths occurred during the dry season, perhaps when Fishing Cat and human resources overlap maximally. A recent study (Adhya 2015) in the Howrah district of West Bengal reveals that Fishing Cat diet is largely composed of small mammals, fish and birds with a negligible portion (less than 5%) comprising of livestock and surmises that the killings are based on a perception of conflict because of the presence of the cat.<br/><br/>In Cambodia the Fishing Cat is killed by locals for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Such killings probably occur throughout its Southeast Asian range.","Fishing Cat populations and habitat in Southeast Asia are severely stressed and the species’ current stronghold is in eastern and southern parts of South Asia. According to Melisch <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1996), in West Java, Fishing Cat populations were fragmented and restricted to coastal areas. However, this was in the 1990s and the evidence was based solely on visual identification of tracks and scats, which may not be reliable; the last photographic evidence of the species in the wild on Java dates to 2000 (A. Compost <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). The Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016). It is unclear the extent, if any, to which these surveys covered microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat. In sum, it is impossible to speculate on current population size in Java, if the species even survives there at all. In Viet Nam the species is perhaps extinct in most or even all of its former range but it was confirmed to persist in the Mekong Delta until at least 2000 (Willcox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). It is not known if it ever occurred in the Red River Delta; given general levels of hunting and persecution in the country it seems unlikely that any large population remains anywhere in Viet Nam (Daniel Willcox <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>In Thailand too, the species seems to be highly localised and recent surveys and incidental records suggest that it is restricted to coastal parts of Central and Southern Thailand (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Buatip <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Tantipisanuh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). There is at least one historical Thai specimen identified as this species from well inland (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010), but the extent to which the species ever occurred widely across inland Thailand, if at all, remains unclear. Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, coastal Thailand, (Cutter 2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats due to poaching and unknown causes over her three-year study period.<br/><br/>Its presence in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar was recently confirmed (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2016), but there is no indication of the population size there, although given the extent of the habitat it could be large. <br/><br/>Extensive camera-trapping in the general area of the only historical locality record from Myanmar, the Hukaung Valley, did not find the species, but camera-traps were not set to target this species, so it is unclear whether it persists there (Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South Asia, the Fishing Cat is currently widespread in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Pakistan population of Fishing Cat was feared to be close to extinction (Roberts 1977), but there are camera-trap records of Fishing Cat from the Chotiari Reservoir in the Sindh Province of Pakistan (Islam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) and recent reports of individuals being sold in local markets in Karachi (Faraz Zubairi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). In Sri Lanka and in India there are small populations of Fishing Cat in densely human-populated urban areas (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Ratnayaka 2016). In Nepal it occurs along a narrow stretch bounding India, in the Terai region (Sagar Dahal <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). It seems to be relatively safe in some protected areas in India, especially those under the Project Tiger scheme, such as Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, at the Indo-Nepal border and the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve bordering Bangladesh. In Bangladesh the Fishing Cat seems to be relatively safe in mangrove forests of the Sundarbans and in the north-eastern swamps (Rahman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). However, on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border, very few surveys have been undertaken to assess the status and distribution of the Fishing Cat across the salinity gradient of the mangrove region.<br/><br/>A molecular analysis of population connectivity in India suggested that in the past Fishing Cat populations within India were connected from the Terai region of the Himalayan foothills to the Coringa mangroves in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). However, this analysis was restricted to the mitochondrial genome and is not comprehensive. Several small pockets of populations survive across the eastern coast and eastern states of India, and many are perhaps yet to be discovered (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Murthy Kantimahanti and Giridhar Malla <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). Similarly, in the western semi-arid part of India a recent record in Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (Sadhu and Reddy 2013) and protected wetlands in the areas neighbouring Rajasthan such as Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary near Agra (Baiju Raj <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) suggest that populations either exist in pockets or are long-distance dispersers tracking suitable habitats. Extensive surveys are required to clarify this. Fishing Cat was thought to be extinct in Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Rajasthan, by 2007 (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but a later survey recorded an individual, and though numbers may be drastically reduced, some individuals may still persist there (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrar Khan pers. comm. 2011). North-eastern India is another region where the species is recorded from pockets e.g. Manas (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) and Kaziranga Tiger Reserves (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) in Assam and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2003, Aparajita Dutta <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). Though there have been several camera-trap surveys in this region targeting Tiger, these may not have adequately covered the habitat of Fishing Cat. Focussed surveys along the several river courses in the region are required to gauge population connectivity and status of Fishing Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and destruction along with the killing of Fishing Cats by local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more, in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside the strongholds, declines may have been considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue currently, and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal and 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta are likely in the next 15 years. These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a drop of a further 30% in the global population.",Decreasing,"The natural distribution of the Fishing Cat is unclear throughout its global range, with many unauthenticated, ambiguous and erroneous records clouding understanding (Pocock 1939, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016, Duckworth 2016, Willcox 2016). In addition the species is not well recorded by typical modern general faunal surveys, meaning that absence of records from areas without specific Fishing Cat surveys should not be taken to imply absence of the species (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016). Other factors also hinder determination of current range: putative introductions, sporadic records from regions not included in past distribution assessments, persistence in small pockets but with drastically reduced numbers and potentially amid areas of widespread extirpation, and possible recent extinctions through much of its range (Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011, Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014, Adhya 2016, Duckworth 2016, Kantimahanti 2016, Mukherjee 2016, Willcox 2016). &#160;<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan in the west to Cambodia in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to Sri Lanka and peninsular Thailand in the south. Its distribution was probably always patchy because of its strong association with wetlands. Current known occurrence is extremely localized across the range except for West Bengal in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.&#160; Results of a molecular analysis of Fishing Cat faeces from five protected areas in India indicated that in the past Fishing Cat populations were connected from the Terai in northern India to the Coringa mangroves on India's east coast; it is unknown whether contemporary populations are still connected physically (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mukherjee 2016). Also unknown is whether population units in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion at the base of the Himalayas are connected outside protected areas or along river courses.<br/><br/>More recently, the species has been recorded in areas where it was never observed before, such as in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, and in the far south of coastal Thailand. It had presumably been overlooked in these areas previously; they are unlikely to indicate recent range extension. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia its occurrence is likely to be extremely patchy in Viet Nam, Lao PDR (if it occurs there at all), Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Detailed country-wise distributions are provided below:<br/><br/>Pakistan: this population was thought to be close to extinction in the early 1970s (Roberts 1977), but Islam <em>et al.</em> (2015) camera-trapped individuals in the Chotiari Reservoir area in the Sanghar District of Sindh Province. There are also reports of individuals being sold and seized in a wildlife market in Karachi (Bhatti 2015, Faraz Ubairi <em>in litt.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Nepal: intensive camera trapping surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> monitoring since 2008 corroborated the Fishing Cat's presence in Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the far western Terai, but failed to record it in Bardia National Park (Babu Ram Lamichhane and Shailendra Yadav pers. comm. 2016). It is present in and around Jagadishpur Reservoir, a Ramsar site in south-western Nepal (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in Chitwan National Park in the central Terai (Dahal and Dahal 2011, Mishra 2016). In south-eastern Nepal, it has been recorded in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (Pandey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sagar Dahal and Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Whether these populations are connected outside protected areas remains unknown.<br/><br/>India: protected areas hosting Fishing Cat populations include Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Baiju Raj <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Corbett Tiger Reserve, Uttarakhand (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012), Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal (Yadavendradev Jhala <em>in litt.</em> 2015), Keoladeo Ghana National Park (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012) and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan (Sadhu and Reddy 2013), Kaziranga Karbi Anglong Landscape (Jimmy Borah <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Malla and Sivakumar 2014) and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Aparajita Datta <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Outside protected areas, records exist from Pilibhit Forest Division in Uttar Pradesh (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2011), in small wetland patches in West Bengal near Kolkata and its suburbs like the Howrah and Hooghly districts (Anonymous 1989, Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011), in Medinipur and Nadia districts and in the human-dominated north-eastern part of Chilika Lake and Tangi district in Odisha (Tiasa Adhya <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The Fishing Cat has also been recorded recently in areas lacking historical records viz. the Krishna River mangroves in Andhra Pradesh (Kantimahanti 2016). There are also historical statements of occurrence in the Western Ghats and the western coast of India (Pocock 1939), which have not been confirmed by recent targeted searches and may have been in error (Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In the Duars of north-eastern India, superficially suitable habitat may extend into Bhutan, but a number of general surveys there have not recorded the species (e.g. Tempa <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banerjee and Bandopadhyay 2016).<br/><br/>Sri Lanka: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas along the coast and in the island's interior (Andrew Kittle <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Individuals have also been recorded in densely human-populated urban areas of Colombo and outside protected areas in Kandy, Mathle and Nuwaraeliya districts (Ratnayaka 2016, Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas of the Sundarbans (Rahman 2016, Adam Barlow pers. comm. 2016), in unprotected wetlands in the Brahmaputra river basin (Rahman and McCarthy 2014, Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in the Chittagong hill tracts (Chakma 2015, Karim and Ahsan 2016). However, Chakma (2015) obtained only three potential records of which two were pugmarks and one was a video from a camera-trap which was not authenticated as Fishing Cat and could have been a Leopard Cat P. bengalensis.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, there are only two certain field records: one from the early 20th century in the Hukaung Valley in the north, and one from Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary in the Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) delta in or around 2015 (Than Zaw <em>in litt.</em> 2016). This corroborates reports that a few captive individuals in the country are said to be descendants of animals captured in or around the 1990s in the Ayeyarwady delta (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Thailand: during targeted surveys Fishing Cat was recorded inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area along the coast, but not in protected areas farther inland that were previously thought to harbour Fishing Cat (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em>et al.</em> 2014). An incidental record came from the coast in southern Thailand (Buatip <em>et al.</em> 2013; confirmed by photograph examined by J.W. Duckworth and W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2016), which constitutes the southernmost valid record with a precise locality to date in mainland Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Cambodia: camera-trap records are scarce and limited to Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in the country's north-east (Rainey and Kong 2010), and mangrove habitats in Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary and Ream National Park on the coast (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Despite extensive camera-trapping in eastern and northern Cambodia including Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in recent years, Fishing Cat was not recorded. (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2012, Simon Mahood pers. comm. 2016). A kitten found orphaned in Botum-Sakor National Park was identified as Fishing Cat, but may have been a Leopard Cat (Royan 2009). Of many other claims in the last 15 years, most are certainly in error, but a critical evaluation of all has not been performed.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR most claims are either in certain error or non-assessable; only one sounds credible but this is a sight-record that cannot be validated (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Viet Nam: Fishing Cat may persist in the Mekong Delta, where it was last camera-trapped in 2000 (Willcox 2016). There is a very small possibility that it occurs in the Red River Delta (where it has never been confirmed), though there have been no targeted surveys to be confident of genuine absence or local extinction (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Indonesia: it is known to have occurred only along the west and north coast of Java within 15 km of the coast (Sody 1936, Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996), but there are no records of wild-living individuals since 2000. The inferences of Melisch <em>et al.</em> (1996) are based on a single track and some scats, neither of which can be treated as conclusive evidence. Alain Compost photographed Fishing Cats in Java in the 1990s and suggested that some may still survive in the Banten Bay region and in Ujung Kulon National Park (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Until 2000, he photographed Fishing Cats in Pulau Dua Bird Sanctuary, a protected mangrove forest on the northern coast, but learned of all Fishing Cats been poisoned there by 2006 (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em>in litt.</em> 2016); the overlap, if any, of camera-trap stations with microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat is not known.<br/><br/>There is no certain record from Sumatra, but historical testimony from a hunter who was familiar with the species from Java, and a captive individual in the 2000s in a local zoo indicate that the species might inhabit the island (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, contra Sanderson 2009).<br/><br/>Occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia is also open to doubt (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but the Thai locality record in Buatip <em>et al.</em> (2013) is very close to the Malaysian border. Past claims for Borneo, Taiwan and China lack any credible basis (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Jutzeler <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>The species is known from sea level in parts of its range, and in the northern parts it is likely to occur only in the lowlands. Recent reliable elevation records in the Terai of India and Nepal are all from below 150 m, such as Pilibhit Forest Division and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Jagadishpur Reservoir area, Chitwan National Park (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015, Dahal and Dahal 2012) and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve area (Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016), except one at 330 m on the southern edge of Corbett Tiger Reserve (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012). However, Pocock (1939) accepted a Fishing Cat skin from Barkot near Dehra Dun on the banks of the upper Yamuna river as evidence of at least occasional high-altitude occurrence at about 5,000 ft (ca. 1,500 m), but did not explain whether this individual was killed there, or whether there was any possibility that, while a skin had been procured at that altitude, the animal had originated elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, Fishing Cat has been recorded at elevations up to 1,800 m (Ashan Thudugala <em>in litt.</em> 2016). However, the Sri Lankan altitudinal range seems to be an exception as all other authentic locality records are much lower than that.","The Fishing Cat is killed for consumption and a very recent report from Howrah district, India, reveals the rampant killing of the species outside protected areas in human-dominated landscapes for consumption as part of a cultural practice. Such cases most often go unnoticed or are ignored unless some interested people and non-governmental organisations pursue the case until the perpetrators are convicted (Adhya 2015). In Cambodia, the Fishing Cat is killed by local people for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). In Thailand a radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015) demonstrated that poaching is a major threat when five of 16 radio-collared individuals were killed by poachers (for consumption and retaliation) within the three-year study period. Cutter (2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared individuals attributed to poaching and unknown causes. Opportunistic trading of skins and potentially other parts is likely to occur in mainland Southeast Asia, where such trading is at very high levels and involves a wide diversity of species (e.g. Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014), but there is no evidence of its being particularly sought after there. Similarly, in Java individuals are sometimes seen in the island’s intensive live animal (‘pet’) trade (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but again there is no indication that it is (yet) a specific target.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing Cat is included in CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.

This completely prohibits any exploitation or commercial trade. There is no protection afforded outside protected areas in Nepal (Karan B.

Data on the extent of African Golden Cat AOO loss is unavailable due to a lack of population monitoring. We can infer, however, an approximate AOO loss using data on deforestation and bushmeat hunting, as well as evidence of the effects of these on African Golden Cats.<br/><br/>We infer that the cumulative loss of AOO from deforestation and bushmeat hunting along expanding road networks amounts to &gt;30% in the past 15 years (three Golden Cat generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and qualifies the African Golden Cat for Vulnerable status under criterion A2c. Additionally, the exacerbation of these threats due to population growth, projected mining activities and forest clearance for oil palm plantations will likely cause further reduction in AOO for the Golden Cat and we therefore predict that the AOO will be reduced by at least a further 30% in the next 15 years, lending additional support to the species’ listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.<br/><p></p>","While the Neotropical and Indomalayan regions have several sympatric forest-dependent felid species, this is Africa's only one.  The African Golden Cat occurs mainly in primary moist equatorial forest, although on the periphery of its range it penetrates savanna regions along riverine forest.  It also occurs in montane forest and alpine moorland in the east of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray and Butynski 2013). &#160;<br/><br/>Two studies of scats - from the Ituri forest of the Congo (Hart <em>et al.</em> 1996) and the Dzanga-Sangha forest of the Central African republic (Ray and Sunquist 2001) - found similar results.  Rodents and squirrels were the main prey item (70 % and 62% respectively), followed by small and medium-size duikers (antelopes) (25% and 33% respectively.  Primates made up 5% of the prey items in both studies, and there have been several observations by primate researchers of African Golden Cats hunting arboreal primates (Ray and Butynski 2013, Bahaa-el-din <em>et al. </em>in review).  The same general diet items were reported by Kingdon (1977) from Uganda's Bwindi National Park.  Birds are also taken, and pangolin remains were frequently found in scats from the Ivory Coast's Tai National Park (D. Jenny pers. comm. in Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>African Golden Cats have turned up in the diet of leopards, the only other felid to occur in African moist forest.  African Golden Cat remains were found in five of 196 Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> scats from Gabon's Lopé National Park (Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2005); a single carcass killed by a Leopard was found in the Ituri (Hart <em>et al.</em> 1996).","At least 6.5% of forest (projected from FAO 2011) in Golden Cat range countries has been lost in the past three Golden Cat generations (15 years, Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). This translates into, at minimum, an equivalent loss of range for the Golden Cat as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Prior to the year 2000, West and East Africa had already suffered an 88-92% reduction in rainforest, while Central Africa’s rainforest extent was reduced by 40% (Laurance <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Intensive hunting for bushmeat (&gt;1 million tonnes per year harvested in the Congo Basin, the species’ main stronghold; Wilkie and Carpenter 1999), leading to ‘empty forest syndrome’ (Sayer 1992), likely accounts for greater reduction in area of occupancy (AOO) for the Golden Cat than deforestation, but is more difficult to quantify. Within 10–15 km of roads and settlements, large and medium bodied mammals experience sharp declines in population (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blake <em>et al.</em> 2007, Henschel 2008). In excess of 64% of forest habitat in the Congo Basin lies within 10 km of a road and is also predicted to be affected by higher hunting pressure (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2007). Development of roads increased rapidly in the past 15 years (e.g. 35% increase in the Democratic Republic of Congo and &gt;300% increase in northern Republic of Congo since the year 2000; Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007). Golden Cat populations within these highly impacted areas are likely to be severely reduced or extirpated through direct mortality and loss of prey.<br/><br/>Golden cats are often not a primary target species, but are frequently killed by wire-snares (four individuals in two months in 20 km<sup>2</sup> in Gabon; Bahaa-el-din pers. obs.; and 13 individuals in three months in Lobéké, Cameroon; Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005), probably owing to similarities in body size and trail use to target species such as duikers. In an area of moderate bushmeat hunting, Golden Cats were recorded at less than a quarter of the population densities that they are found at in pristine areas (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al</em>. in prep). Where more intense hunting occurs, such as in village hunting areas (e.g. Dibouka village in central Gabon; Henschel 2008) and national parks (e.g. Korup NP in southwest Cameroon; TEAM, http://www.teamnetwork.org), camera trap and bushmeat studies did not record the species despite the presence of suitable habitat contiguous with the main forest of the Congo Basin.<br/><br/>Recent landscape-scale Golden Cat surveys in mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) emphasize that prior range estimates based on forest cover may have significantly overestimated remaining golden cat range. An estimated 78% of Rio Muni consists of tropical dense forest and therefore putatively suitable habitat, but Golden Cats were found to occupy just 16% of the area (Martinez Marti 2011). Its presence in the area was correlated with rugged, inaccessible terrain away from human disturbance (Martinez Marti 2011). Golden Cats were reported by locals to be easy to hunt and locally extirpated long before other medium-to-large mammal species (Martinez Marti 2011).<br/><br/>These threats will intensify, as the human population within the species’ range shows the fastest growth rates in the world (+2.6-2.8% per annum for West, Central and East Africa; FAO 2011). The population in main Golden Cat range countries, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion for 2013, is projected to almost quadruple by 2100 (UN 2012, <a href=""http:////esa.un.org/wpp/"">http://esa.un.org/wpp/</a>).<br/><br/>The current “stampede of foreign investment” in mining activities and associated infrastructure development in Africa is of immediate concern (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Central Africa, 42% of ecologically important areas would be directly impacted if there were complete development of mineral resources in the region (assuming that ecological impacts extend within 10 km of mines; Edwards et al. 2014). China’s mineral investment alone has quadrupled in 10 years (Zhang 2011). In addition, it is predicted that the conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, which has caused extensive loss of forest habitat and biodiversity in Southeast Asia, will have similar impacts in Africa (particularly in West and Central Africa) as it expands over the coming years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014). The realisation of these investments includes habitat destruction and degradation, relocation of human populations into previously remote areas and massive-scale infrastructural development including road and rail which in turn lead to the aforementioned surge in bushmeat hunting in these areas (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>The African Golden Cat is infrequently observed in the wild, and generally considered rare.

50664030,22732,Panthera uncia,Vulnerable,C1,2017,2016-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Snow Leopard is assessed as Vulnerable because the global population is estimated to number more than 2,500 but fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, and there is an estimated and projected decline of at least 10% over 22.62 years (3 generations). There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book <em>Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson<em> et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the <em>Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex <em></em>(<em>Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (<em>Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (<em>Capra</em> <em>falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (<em>Marmota </em>spp.), pika (<em>Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (<em>Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (<em>Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of <em>ca</em> 25 years (Lovari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali <em>Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi <em>et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The rate of decline is estimated to have exceeded 50% over three generations (24 years), based on figures from surveys in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Réserve de Faune à Okapis; RFO) suggesting a 43% decline over the period 1995-2007, which some reports suggest continued in the period thereafter. The RFO remains the best protected site and it is inferred that the rate of decline here is at least equalled in other parts of the Okapi range. Although monitoring is only available to support estimates of declines in RFO since 1995, reports of declines or extirpations in other parts of the range and loss and degradation of habitat have been ongoing since 1980. The species is confirmed to be Endangered under criterion A2abcd+4abcd.","Okapi are limited to closed, high canopy forests between about 450 m asl and 1,500 m asl and they occur in a wide range of primary and older secondary forest types. They do not extend into gallery forests or the forest-savannah ecotone and do not persist in disturbed habitats surrounding larger settlements. Okapi will use seasonally inundated areas when the substrate is still wet, but they do not occur in truly inundated sites or extensive swamp forest. Tree fall gaps are selected as foraging sites for Okapi during the early stages of regeneration (Hart 2013). Okapi are unique in being the only species of forest ungulate to depend on understorey foliage and they are known to feed on over 100 species. They are mainly diurnal but have also been recorded feeding at night (Nixon and Lusenge 2008). Okapi have defined but non-exclusive home ranges, averaging 3-5 km<sup>2</sup> for adult females and up to 13 km<sup>2</sup> for adult males. Okapi are mainly solitary (Hart 2013). Generation length is broadly estimated at around eight years, based on calculations made for the global captive population (S. Hofman and K. Leus pers. comm. 2013).","Okapi can coexist with small-scale, low-level human occupation of the forest, but disappear in areas of active settlement or disturbance, and the major threat to this species is habitat loss due to logging and human settlement including illegal occupation of protected areas (Hart 2013, Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;According to Hart (2013) approximately one-third of the Okapi’s known distribution is likely to be at risk by major incursions during the first quarter of this century. Areas at high risk include the southeastern Ituri Forest, the Kisangani area, Rubi-Tele, and the western and eastern limits of the species' range in the Ebola River basin and Virunga-Hoyo region respectively.<br/><br/>Hunting for meat and skins is also a threat and Okapi decline rapidly in areas where there is persistent use of snares. In some areas, Okapi are targeted for bushmeat whereas in others they are taken only incidentally (Hart 2013, Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The most prominent current threat to Okapi is the presence of illegal armed groups in and around key protected areas. These groups prevent effective conservation action, even surveys and monitoring in most sites, and engage in and facilitate elephant poaching, bushmeat hunting, illegal mining (gold, coltan and diamonds), illegal logging, charcoal production and agricultural encroachment. In a notorious incident in June 2012, armed rebels attacked the RFO HQ and killed seven people and all 14 captive Okapi.","East (1999) estimated that the total population may be over 10,000 and Hart (2013) estimated 35,000-50,000, though both sets of figures are perhaps better regarded as ‘guesstimates’ as they rely on extrapolation of a limited number of patchily distributed, dung-based surveys. Individual Okapi are rarely encountered and in much of their range they are uncommon or dispersed in localized areas, with dung found at low densities, commonly resulting in inadequate sample sizes for statistical analysis. Current numbers are believed to be lower and declining, but there is no reliable estimate of current population size. <br/><br/>It is widely considered that there was a decline in the Okapi population, along with other species, following the decade-long civil war which ended in the early 2000s. Population estimates were made in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Réserve de Faune à Okapis; RFO) in 1993-1995 and repeated in 2005-2007 using the same ‘monitoring’ transects and distance sampling methodology, though individual transects were not necessarily carried out at the same time of year due to insecurity limiting access to parts of the Reserve (Hart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). These surveys showed a decline in dung density of 43% between the two survey periods. A second set of transects in 2005-2007 used an improved spatial design (systematic placement of transects covering the entire reserve), but were also conducted across seasons for the reasons above. Further analysis is required to determine whether comparison of these ‘systematic’ transects with the 1995-1997 and 2005-2007 monitoring transects, and a further set of transects conducted in 2000-2002 over part of the reserve under the MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) program, supports the observed decline in dung density, and to specifically investigate seasonality as a variable. The same type of systematic design was used again in 2010-2011, but implemented over the three month dry season to reduce the effects of seasonality. While an overall comparison between the two systematic surveys (2005-2007 and 2010-2011) appeared to show an increase in Okapi dung density (Vosper <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), a comparison between transects undertaken at the same time of year (the dry season only), in the same area of the reserve, showed no significant difference in Okapi dung density (F. Maisels pers. comm. 2014). Seasonal differences in dung decay rates therefore complicate comparisons between these various sets of surveys.<br/><br/>Supporting evidence for RFO is available from Law Enforcement Monitoring (LEM) patrols from 2008 to 2013. These patrols covered distances of 10,125–25,467 km annually and showed an apparent decline in Okapi dung encounter rates between 2008 and 2013 (ICCN RFO unpubl. data). However, because the patrols were focused on anti-poaching and wildlife recording was secondary, patrol routes were not randomly located, and patrol timings and locations varied among years because of security and logistical issues, the data must be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Since the rebel attack on the RFO headquarters in June 2012 (see ‘Threats’ below), the presence of armed groups and an influx of illegal miners and poachers has reduced the ability of the reserve authorities to protect the reserve and this is likely to have ongoing implications for resident wildlife populations. RFO is still the most effectively protected Okapi site with resident rangers and an active conservation programme and the overall rate of decline here is inferred to have been equalled or exceeded elsewhere.<br/><br/>In the Twabinga-Mundo region, anecdotal evidence suggests that Okapi are targeted for their skins and meat, and have undergone a drastic decline in numbers over the past two decades with local people reporting that Okapi is the most prized bushmeat available (Nixon&#160;2010). Okapi had been present south of the town of Aketi and near the town of Buta but no signs were found on recent field surveys and locals said they had recently been hunted out by Bangalema nomadic hunters (Hicks 2010).",Decreasing,"Okapi distribution extends across parts of central, northern and eastern DR Congo. North and east of the Congo River, Okapi range from Maiko Forest north to the Ituri Forest, then west through the Rubi, Tele and Ebola river basins, extending north towards the Ubangi River. Okapi have a much smaller range to the west and south of the Congo River, extending from the west bank of the Lomami River west to the upper Lomela and Tshuapa basins (Hart 2013). In the fairly recent past, Okapi occurred occasionally in the adjoining Semliki forest of western Uganda (Kingdon 1979).<br/><br/>Recorded presence is concentrated in and around protected areas, mainly reflecting survey effort. The remoteness and inaccessibility of much Okapi habitat make field work logistically difficult, and insecurity in DRC over the past two decades has further restricted survey activity. As a consequence, extensive parts of potential Okapi range are poorly studied. Furthermore, Okapi are secretive and their occurrence can easily go undetected, especially at low densities.<br/><br/>The known strongholds of the Okapi are the Ituri and Maiko landscapes, the forests of the upper Lindi, Maiko and Tshopo basins and the Rubi-Tele region in Bas Uele (Hart 2013). There are confirmed recent (2013) records of Okapi in the Abumonbanzi Reserve in Gbadolite district of North Ubangi at the northwest end of the distribution (Ngbolua <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Since 1980, expansion of human settlement, deforestation and forest degradation have eliminated important portions of the Okapi range, in particular in the southern and eastern Ituri Forest where the species was at one time abundant (Hart 2013).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 383,190 km<sup>2</sup>, but this includes unsuitable habitat such as degraded forest, swamp forest and urban areas. Excluding all these gives in an area of 244,405 km<sup>2</sup> for the suitable or hypothesised range (Kümpel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). The area of occupancy (AOO) is 14,112 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a grid of 5.6 x 5.6 km, the size used by most reported surveys and 450 (3.5%) of 12,764 grid squares with confirmed presence Kümpel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015). The AOO figure is however considered likely to be a substantial underestimate, surveys have been conducted in only 1,994 (15.6%) out of 12,764 grid squares so far.",Okapi are hunted for meat and skins.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is not included in the CITES Appendices. The Okapi is a fully protected species under Congolese law and the species is a national symbol, appearing on the insignia of the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) and on Congolese banknotes. <br/> <br/> The RFO (14,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and Maiko National Park (10,800 km<sup>2</sup>) support significant populations, but numbers in both sites have declined owing to the threats listed above. Strengthening protection of these two protected areas is the single most important means to ensure long-term survival of Okapi (East 1999, Hart 2013). A small population of Okapi still occurs in the Watalinga Forest (1,100 km<sup>2</sup>) in the northern sector of Virunga National Park, but currently receives no protection due to the presence of armed groups, though a new forest corridor project connecting Watalinga to the Mt Hoyo Reserve (200 km<sup>2</sup>), where Okapi have also been recorded, is due to start in 2015. Okapi occur in Rubi-Tele Hunting Reserve (c. 9,000 km<sup>2</sup>), though its precise legal status is unclear, in Abumonbanzi Reserve in the far west of the range, and on the west bank of the Congo River, where the proposed Lomami National Park within the Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba landscape (9,500 km<sup>2</sup>) is undergoing the process of official gazettement (Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015). A number of community reserves are located around Maiko National Park. </p>  <p>Many captive Okapi are held in international collections. In November 2011, representatives of the North American and European captive populations, including the Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), met to discuss the role of the captive population in Okapi conservation and agreed to maintain a sustainable, cooperatively managed global <em>ex situ</em> Okapi population that contributes to a viable <em>in situ</em> population (Petric 2012). The zoo community is a major supporter of Okapi conservation work, in 2010 donating USD 225,000 to the Okapi Conservation Project, 33% of its budget (Gilman International Conservation, 2010). </p>    <p>ICCN is the government agency responsible for protected area management but is under-staffed and under-funded. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 and works within the RFO to protect Okapi and their habitat, as well as the culture of the indigenous Mbuti pygmies. Project activities include capacity building, agroforestry and community support (Gilman International Conservation 2010). The Wildlife Conservation Society started field surveys and research on Okapi in RFO and elsewhere in DRC in the 1980s. Several other international NGOs have also conducted Okapi-related work in DRC, including Fauna &amp; Flora International, Frankfurt Zoological Society, the Lukuru Foundation, and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The first-ever species-wide Okapi conservation strategy was developed at a workshop held in DRC in May 2013 that was organised by ZSL in partnership with ICCN (Kümpel<em> et al.</em> 2015). In March 2013 a new IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group was established, co-hosted by ZSL, with the aim of coordinating research and conservation on both giraffid species and supporting implementation of the Okapi conservation strategy.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
57549321,899,Vulpes lagopus,Least Concern,,2014,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats, with a global population in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers, but in most areas population status is believed to be good and there is no reason to believe that the species currently qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the criteria.","Inhabits Arctic and alpine tundra on the continents of Eurasia, North America and the Canadian archipelago, Siberian islands, Greenland, inland Iceland and Svalbard, and Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands and coastal Iceland. <br/><br/>The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger but in most inland areas, the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. The species' main prey items include lemmings, both <em>Lemmus</em> spp. and <em>Dicrostonyx</em> spp. (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Fennoscandia, <em>Lemmus lemmus</em> was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds (Passeriformes, Galliformes and Caridriiformes, 34%) and reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (21%; Elmhagen <em>et al</em>. 2000). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse (<em>Lagopus</em> spp.) are common prey in addition to rodents and reindeer (Kaikusalo and Angerbjörn 1995). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013) with up to 20 cubs produced by a single female (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1998).<br/><br/>Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (<em>Uria aalge</em>, <em>U. lomvia</em>), seal carcasses and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of Arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally (Samelius and Lee 1998).&#160;Some populations switch between lemmings, migratory birds and marine resources depending on intra- and interannual variations in prey availability. The Arctic Fox depends also on remains of carrion left by larger predators, e.g. Polar Bear, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, and Wolverine <em>Gulo gulo</em>. It is itself a victim of predation, mainly from Red Fox, Wolverine, Golden Eagle, and humans.","Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox. With the decline of the fur hunting industry, the threat of over-exploitation is lowered for most Arctic Fox populations. They may also be subject to direct persecution (as on St. Paul Island). Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy. In areas connected to marine ecosystems, Arctic Foxes may also be affected by indirect threats, such as diseases and the effects of persistent organic pollutants (Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2008); indeed, an emerging threat in Fennoscandia is the impact of sarcoptic mange on populations (Mörner 1992).&#160;In some areas, gene swamping by farm-bred blue foxes (see Conservation) may threaten native populations (Norén&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).","The world population of Arctic Foxes is in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers. In most areas, however, population status is believed to be good. The species is common in the tundra areas of Russia, Canada, coastal Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Exceptions are Fennoscandia, islands in the Bering Sea (Mednyi Island, Russia; Pribilof Islands, Alaska, e.g., St Paul), where populations are at critically low levels and appear to be declining further. On some Aleutian Islands, Alaska, non-native Arctic Foxes are being eradicated in the course of bird conservation efforts (Walton <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Vagrant Arctic Foxes are common over the northern sea-ice where can move several thousands of kilometres following Polar Bears <em>Ursus maritimus&#160;</em>as scavengers (Tarroux <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Stable,"The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats. It breeds north of and above the tree line on the Arctic tundra in North America and Eurasia and on the alpine tundra in Fennoscandia, ranging from northern Greenland at 88°N to the southern tip of Hudson Bay, Canada, 53°N. The southern edge of the species' distribution range may have moved somewhat north during the 20th century resulting in a smaller total range (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1992). The species inhabits most Arctic islands and many islands in the Bering Sea. The Arctic Fox was also introduced to previously isolated islands in the Aleutian chain at the end of the 19th century by the fur industry (Bailey 1992), where they are now often being eliminated by bird conservation efforts (Walton <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Arctic Fox has also been observed on the sea ice up to the North Pole. They may occur up to 3,000 m asl in elevation.&#160;<br/><br/>During the last glaciation, the Arctic Fox had a distribution along the ice edge, and Arctic Fox remains have been found in a number of Pleistocene deposits over most of Europe and large parts of Siberia (Dalén <em>et al</em>. 2007).","The Arctic Fox remains the single most important terrestrial game species in the Arctic. Indigenous peoples have always utilized its exceptional fur, and with the advent of the fur industry, the Arctic Fox quickly became an important source of income. Today, leg-hold traps and shooting are the main hunting methods. Because of their large reproductive capacity, Arctic Foxes can maintain population levels under high hunting pressure. In some areas, up to 50% of the total population has been harvested on a sustainable basis (Nasimovic and Isakov 1985). However, this does not allow for hunting during population lows, as shown by the situation in Fennoscandia. The Arctic Fox has nevertheless survived high fur prices better than most other Arctic mammals. Hunting has declined considerably in the last decades, as a result of low fur prices and alternative sources of income. In the Yukon, for example, the total value of all fur production decreased from $1.3 million in 1988 to less than $300,000 after 2000.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The species is not included in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In most of its range, the Arctic Fox is not protected. However, the species and its dens have had total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in mainland Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the Arctic Fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE). It is therefore to be given full protection. On St. Paul Island the declining Arctic Fox population currently has no legal protection (Walton<em> et al</em>. 2013). In Norway (Svalbard), Greenland, Canada, Russia, and Alaska, trapping is limited to licensed trappers operating in a defined trapping season. The enforcement of these laws appears to be uniformly good. In Iceland, bounty hunting takes place over most of the country outside nature reserves.<br/><br/>For occurrence in protected areas, good information is available only for Sweden and Finland. For Iceland, Arctic Foxes could potentially appear in most protected areas. <br/><br/>An action plan has been developed for Arctic Foxes in Sweden (Elmhagen 2008) and status reports have been published for Norway (Ulvund <em>et al</em>. 2013) and Finland (Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Sweden, Norway and Finland, a conservation project led to significant increases in the population (Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>The Arctic Fox occurs widely in captivity on fur farms and has been bred for fur production for over 70 years. The present captive population originates from a number of wild populations and has been bred for characteristics different from those found in the wild, including large size. Escaped ""blue"" foxes may already be a problem in Fennoscandia (and to a lesser extent in Iceland) due to gene swamping (Norén <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;In Norway, foxes bred in captivity have successfully been released into the wild (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The following gaps still exist in knowledge of the Arctic Fox:<br/><br/>1) Little is known concerning the impact of diseases on fox populations, e.g. sarcoptic mange and <em>Echinococcus multilocularis</em>. Allied to this is our lack of knowledge of the epidemiology of Arctic rabies.<br/><br/>2) Considering the northward spread of the Red Fox in certain areas, studies are necessary to determine the effects of competition between Red Foxes and Arctic Foxes on various population parameters and Arctic Fox life-history patterns.<br/><br/>3) The non-recovery of the Fennoscandian population is a cause for concern, and requires specific attention, especially in terms of disease and genetics.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In the western part of the range, Corsacs occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall grass steppes. In Kaspyi Sea region the steppes and tarragon-cereal semi-deserts are favoured. It also occurs in fixed-sand habitats (Nogaiskaya Steppe). In the Volgo-Ural watershed the Corsac inhabits most usual habitats, but prefers semi-deserts. To the east of the Ural Mountains, the species inhabits steppes and in favourable years occurs even in forested steppes. In Mongolia and Kazakhstan typical habitats are low grass steppes and semi-deserts, often inhabiting low hills, but avoiding low mountains. In Middle-Asia it inhabits semi-deserts and ephemeral-deserts, avoiding drifting sands. One limiting factor is snow height in winter, and this species has been reported to avoid areas where the depth of snow exceeds 150 mm, preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed. <br/><br/>Corsacs occupy home ranges that vary depending on landscape conditions.&#160;In Mongolia, home ranges averaged 6.5 km<sup>2</sup> and ranged from 2.2 to 9.7 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;seasonally among a radio-collared population.&#160;Home ranges elsewhere have been reported to vary from as small as 1 km<sup>2</sup> to as large as 35-40 km<sup>2</sup> (based on anecdotal reports and observations).&#160;Home ranges typically include a mix of steppe, semi-desert, and desert habitats.<br/><br/>Corsacs are mainly nocturnal, but have been observed to be active during twilight and daytime hours.&#160;They typically spend daytime hours in a subterranean burrow or den, which presumably provides shelter from weather conditions (e.g, heat, aridity).&#160;Home ranges may have several actively used burrows, which may also provide temporary refuges from predators or competitors.&#160;About 64% of burrows used in Mongolia were those of Siberian marmots (<em>Marmota sibirica</em>).&#160;Marmots live in colonies that may include &gt;90 burrows spread over several hectares.&#160;Marmots have declined substantially due to overharvesting.&#160;The decline of marmots may be linked to population declines of Corsacs in some areas.","<p>The primary threat to Corsac Foxes is over-harvesting.&#160;Throughout most of their range, Corsacs are hunted intensively for their pelts.&#160;Hunting has been a traditional (and commercial) activity in most range countries and harvest numbers have historically been large.&#160;For example, up to 50,000 foxes were harvested in Russia in some years during the 20th century (one record even indicated 135,700 skins were tanned in 1923/24) (Heptner and Naumov 1998).&#160;Similarly, in Mongolia, an estimated 1.1 million furs were sold to the Soviet Union from 1932 to 1972 with a peak trade of 62,926 in 1947 (Wingard and Zahler 2006).&#160;Over-harvesting resulted in hunting bans in both countries at times to allow populations to recover following periods of intensive hunting.&#160;Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, societal change has resulted in few regulations on hunting in several range countries, which has been exacerbated by growing commercial markets for fur.&#160;As a result, over-harvesting and illegal trade in international markets has been a growing concern for the species.</p>  Other threats include overgrazing by livestock and landscape development (e.g., roads, houses, mining), which may reduce habitat quality for the species.&#160;The decline of marmots may also impact the species in some areas, as Corsacs often use marmot burrows as daytime resting locations.&#160;Further studies on the impacts of land use/development and interactions with other species are needed.","The Corsac Fox is generally a widespread and common species.&#160; However, there are no range-wide estimates of population size and few details are known about the characteristics of regional populations.&#160;Most information on population trends is based on harvest numbers and observations.&#160;Some accounts suggest that Corsac populations fluctuate greatly over short periods of time, often in response to climatic events (e.g., cold winters with high snowfall). One report indicated that numbers can drop tenfold within the space of a single year. By comparison, in favourable years, numbers can increase by the same margin, but more within a three- to four-year period. Population changes have also driven by intensive harvesting for furs.&#160;Harvest levels have varied by country and probably reflect population trends.",Unknown,"Corsac distribution extends across much of Eurasia. One part covers the Middle Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, as well as steppe and forest-steppe areas of Russia, including the southern region of Western Siberia. In Europe its range reaches the Samara Region, Tatarstan to the North and northern Caucasia to the South. The second, much smaller area lies in southern Transbaikalia representing the northern periphery of the Mongolian and Manchurian section of the species' distribution. Outside Russia the species' range includes the steppe part of north-eastern China, including Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and the region between Argun and Big Khingan, most of Mongolia except for its forested and mountain regions, Dgungaria, Kashgaria, Afghanistan (probably only northern) and north-eastern Iran. The southern limit of distribution is unknown, but it probably reaches to the mountain ridges separating the Tibetan Highlands from the north. Thus, the two ranges (western and eastern) are connected by a relatively narrow neck in the Dgungar Gate and Zaisan Basin region. In recent years, a westward area expansion has been recorded, particularly into the Voronezh region following active recovery of Baibak (<em>Marmota bobak</em>) populations. Occasionally, the species is recorded from the Ukrainian steppe (as far as Pavlodar to the West), eastern Transcaucasia (Azerbaijan) and, probably, western Kyrgyzstan.<br/><br/>In Russia the Corsac is rare in most regions, but common in western Siberia and Transbaikalia. It sometimes occurs in northern parts of western Siberia's forested steppes, but in low numbers. The species is common everywhere between the Volga and Ural rivers.

Generally, the species is common to rare, with population densities fluctuating with annual environmental conditions. Estimation of a population size or even population trends for this species is not possible with currently available information. Population monitoring for this species is largely limited to only a few specific sites. However, natural habitats occupied by the Kit Fox are being transformed (e.g., agriculture, solar energy). Thus, in numerous locations throughout the range, it is safe to assume that, overall, populations and area of occupancy are declining. Nonetheless, the species currently does not meet any of the thresholds for the threatened categories, and is presently assessed as Least Concern.

Areas with sparse ground cover are preferred (McGrew 1977, Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is found in elevations ranging from 400–1,900 m a.s.l., although Kit Foxes generally avoid rugged terrain with slopes &gt;5% (Warrick and Cypher 1998). Loose textured soils may be preferred for denning. Kit Foxes will use agricultural lands, particularly orchards, on a limited basis, and also can inhabit urban environments (Morrell 1972, Cypher 2010). Home range size varies from 251 ha to 1160 ha and generally does not differ between sexes (Cypher 2003). Size can vary with habitat conditions, particularly food availability (Spiegel 1996, Zoellick <em>et al</em>. 2002). Kit foxes are primarily nocturnal and nightly movements exceeding 14 km have been reported (Zoellick <em>et al</em>. 1989, 2002). Kit Foxes use dens year-round and uses include daytime resting, escaping predators, avoiding temperature extremes, conserving moisture, and bearing and rearing young (Egoscue 1962, Morrell 1972, Koopman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Kit Foxes can excavate their own dens, but also will modify and use the burrows of badgers, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and kangaroo rats (Morrell 1972, List 1997, Koopman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Dens are distributed throughout home ranges, and an individual fox typically uses over 11 dens during a given year (Koopman <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Kit Foxes primarily consume animal prey and common items include rodents, rabbits, invertebrates, birds, lizards, and snakes. Among rodents, kangaroo rats, pocket mice, prairie dogs, and ground squirrels generally are preferred, and common invertebrate prey include beetles, crickets, and grasshoppers (Cypher 2003, List <em>et al</em>. 2003). Fluctuations in food availability related to variable annual precipitation levels are a primary factor driving Kit Fox population dynamics (White and Garrott 1997, Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000). Kit Foxes do not require free water but will drink it if available (Egoscue 1956, Golightly and Ohmart 1984).<br/><br/>Kit Foxes experience intense interference and exploitative competition from other species, particularly coyotes (White <em>et al</em>. 1995, Cypher and Spencer 1998, Kozlowski<em> et al</em>. 2008). Other competitors include bobcats, badgers, golden eagles, and red foxes. Predators generally are the primary source of mortality, but other causes include vehicles, harvest, and rodenticides (Ralls and White 1995; Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2014). Disease does not appear to be a significant factor in most Kit Fox populations. At one site, annual survival probabilities for adults ranged from 0.20 to 0.81 over 16 years with a mean of 0.44 (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000).&#160;<br/><br/>Kit Foxes pair during October and November (if not already paired), and breed in December and January (Egoscue 1956). Gestation is 49-55 days, and parturition occurs during January-March (Egoscue 1956, Egoscue 1962, Zoellick <em>et al</em>. 1987). Typical litter size averages about 4 and ranges from 1-9 (Cypher 2003). Annual reproductive success is strongly influenced by food availability (Egoscue 1975, White and Garrott 1997) and at one location ranged from 20-100% over a 16-year period (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000). Kit Foxes mate for life and are primarily monogamous with occasional instances of polygyny (Egoscue 1962; Ralls <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2007). Young from previous years, typically females, may delay dispersal and assist with raising the current year’s litter (Koopman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ralls <em>et al</em>. 2001).","The main threat to the long-term survival of the Kit Fox is habitat conversion, mainly to agriculture but also to urban and industrial development. In both western and eastern Mexico, prairie dog towns, which support important populations of Kit Foxes are being converted to agricultural fields (e.g., Ávila-Flores <em>et al.</em> 2012), and in eastern Mexico the road network is expanding, producing a concomitant increase in the risk of vehicle mortality. In the San Joaquin Valley of California, habitat conversion for agriculture is slowing, but habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation associated with industrial and urban development are still occurring at a rapid pace.&#160;More recently, expansive industrial-scale solar energy generating facilities are being constructed throughout the western USA, but particularly in California, Arizona, and Nevada.","The species is common to rare. Density fluctuates with annual environmental conditions, which are dependent upon precipitation (Cypher <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Utah, density ranged from 0.1–0.8/km² (Egoscue 1956, 1975). In California, density varied from 0.15–0.24/km² over a period of three years on one study site (White <em>et al.</em> 1996) and from 0.2–1.7/km² over 15 years on another study site (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000). Kit Fox densities in prairie dog town complexes in Mexico were 0.32–0.8/km² in Chihuahua (List 1997) and 0.1/km² in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon (Côtera 1996).<br/><br/>In Mexico, data on which to base a population estimate for Kit Foxes are only available from two localities with very specific characteristics (presence of prairie dog towns). Therefore, the estimation of a population size for the country or even population trends is not possible with current information. However, because natural habitats occupied by the Kit Fox are being transformed, it is safe to assume that, overall, populations of the Kit Fox in Mexico are declining. In the past 10 years, about 40% of prairie dog towns in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon were converted to agriculture (L. Scott and E. Estrada unpubl.), and of the area occupied in Chihuahua by prairie dogs in 1988, 76% remained in 2005 (Ávila <em>et al</em>. 2012) and by 2013 only 3% remained &#160;(R. Sierra and E. Ponce pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the United States, Kit Fox abundance is unknown. Populations are relatively large and trends are assumed to be relatively stable in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and possibly the Mjoave Desert of California, based on extensive remaining suitable habitat. Populations in Colorado, Idaho, and Oregon are relatively small and trends are unknown (Cypher 2003). Populations of the Endangered (USFWS) San Joaquin Kit Fox in the San Joaquin Valley of California are likely still declining due to continuing habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation (USFWS 1998).",Decreasing,"The Kit Fox inhabits the deserts and arid lands of western North America. In the United States, it occurs from southern California to western Colorado and western Texas, north into southern Oregon and Idaho. In Mexico, it occurs across the Baja California Peninsula and across northern Sonora and Chihuahua to western Nuevo León, and south into northern Zacatecas (McGrew 1979, Hall 1981).","In Mexico, Kit Foxes are occasionally sold illegally on the pet market. Kit Foxes are harvested for fur in some states in the USA (e.g., Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah), but otherwise are not used commercially.",Terrestrial,"Not listed on the CITES Appendices. The Kit Fox is considered Vulnerable in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2010). In the United States, the San Joaquin Kit Fox (<em>V. m. mutica</em>) is federally classified as Endangered, and as Threatened by the state of California (USFWS 1998). In Oregon, Kit Foxes are classified as Threatened. In Colorado, Kit Foxes are classified as Endangered. In Idaho, Kit Foxes are considered a protected non-game species.&#160;Harvests are not permitted in Idaho, Oregon, or California, and the Kit Fox is a protected furbearer species (i.e., regulated harvests) in Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. In Mexico, the vulnerable status of the Kit Fox grants conservation measures for the species, but these are not enforced. In the United States, state and federal protections for Kit Foxes are being enforced.&#160;<br/>In Mexico, Kit Foxes are found in the Biosphere Reserves of El Vizcaino, Mapimi, El Pinacate and Janos, in the Area of Special Protection of Cuatro Ciénegas, and are probably found in another eight protected areas throughout their range. In the United States, they occur in numerous protected areas throughout their range. The Endangered subspecies <em>V. m. mutica</em> occurs in the Carrizo Plain National Monument and various other federal, state, and private conservation lands.<br/><br/>Efforts are underway to protect the prairie dog towns of both eastern (Pronatura Noreste) and western Mexico (Institute of Ecology from the National University of Mexico), which are known to be strongholds for the Kit Fox, but no specific actions focused on the Kit Fox are being undertaken in Mexico. In the United States, a recovery plan has been completed (USFWS 1998) and is being implemented for the San Joaquin Kit Fox. Recovery actions include protection of essential habitat, and demographic and ecological research in both natural and anthropogenically modified landscapes. <br/><br/>No captive breeding efforts are currently being conducted for Kit Foxes. Facilities such as the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson, Arizona, California Living Museum in Bakersfield, California, and several zoos keep live Kit Foxes for display and educational purposes.<br/><br/>Gaps in knowledge<br/>In general, demographic and ecological data are needed throughout the range of the species so that population trends and demographic patterns can be assessed. In Mexico,&#160;available&#160;information on the Kit Fox is scarce. The most important gaps in our knowledge of the species are the present distribution of the species and population estimates throughout its range. General biological information is needed from more localities in the Mexican range of the Kit Fox. In the United States, information is needed on the effects of solar energy plants, investigating dispersal patterns and corridors, determining metapopulation dynamics and conducting viability analyses, developing conservation strategies in anthropogenically altered landscapes, assessing threats from non-native Red Foxes, and range-wide population monitoring.<br/><br/>Research in progress in Mexico includes investigations of abundance and diet in the Janos Biosphere Reserve as well as relationships between Kit Foxes and sylvatic plague.

The prime habitat for the species is xerophytic thorn forest characterized by emergent trees, such as <em>Schinopsis lorentzii</em> and <em>Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco</em>; a dense shrub layer including <em>Ruprechtia triflora</em>, <em>Caparis</em> spp. and <em>Acacia</em> spp.; and a ground cover of bromeliads and cactii, such as <em>Opuntia</em> sp., <em>Cleistocactus baumannii</em> and <em>Eriocereus guelichii</em> (Mayer and Brandt 1982). Chacoan Peccaries are also found at lower density in open woodland, characterized by trees such as <em>Tabebuia caraiba</em> and <em>Schinopsis balansae</em> (Taber <em>et al</em>. 1993). Cacti, including <em>Cleistocactus</em>, <em>Eriocereus</em>, <em>Quiabentia</em> and at least two species of <em>Opuntia</em>, constitute the principal food of Chacoan Peccaries. They also forage on the roots of bromeliads, fruit from various species of <em>Acacia </em>and <em>Prosopis</em>, and occasionally browse on forbs (Mayer and Brandt 1982, Taber <em>et al</em>. 1993). Chacoan Peccaries lick and eat mineral rich soil from naturally occurring salt licks and leaf-cutter ant mounds. They also consume carrion on occasion and may even prey on small mammals.<br/><br/>Like the Collared Peccary, they are territorial and their home range sizes, based on convex polygons, measure about 1,100 ha and contain a core area of about 600 ha in the Paraguayan Chaco (Taber <em>et al</em>. 1993). Density estimates vary from less than 1 individual/km<sup>2</sup> to as high as 9.2 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Mayer and Brandt 1982). A study in the Paraguayan Chaco produced a density estimate of 0.43 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup> (1.1 individuals/square mile) (Taber 1991). In the Argentine Chaco the density varied between 0.17 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup> in hunted sites to 0.44 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup> in non-hunted sites (Altrichter 2005). <br/><br/>Chacoan Peccaries are diurnal and become active about sunrise, are active throughout the day and become inactive at dusk (Taber 1991). Reports of herd sizes in the Paraguayan Chaco vary between one and nine (Mayer and Brandt 1982, Sowls 1997), with an average of 4.5 (Taber <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, in hunted areas, average group sizes are smaller ranging from one to four (Taber <em>et al</em>. 1993, Mayer and Brandt 1982, Altrichter and Boaglio 2004). <br/><br/>A slightly biased sex ratio in favour of males has been reported by Mayer and Brandt (1982) and Sowls (1984). Captive females in Paraguay (Proyecto Taguá, San Diego Zoo) gave birth between 1.2 and 8.3 years of age; younger females (under three years old) usually had smaller litters than older females. They have one litter a year. Litter sizes in Paraguay have been reported to vary between one and four with averages of 2.72 (Mayer and Brandt 1982, Brooks 1992, Yahnke <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). Taber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (1993) estimated litter size of 1.7 for a wild population and presumed that this small litter size resulted from low reproductive rate or high neonate mortality. The farrowing season extends from September through January. Maximum longevity is unknown, but Sowls (1984) estimated the age of some individuals, based on tooth cementum layers, as at least nine years. In captivity, animals have reached 18 years (Proyecto Taguá, Fortín Toledo, Paraguay). Gestation time in captivity has been found to be 151 days (Proyecto Tagua, San Diego Zoo).","The decline in the range and numbers of Chacoan Peccaries is probably due to a combination of factors. These factors include hunting by humans, habitat destruction, and diseases. Predation by large felids is also a contributor (Taber 1989, 1991, 1993; Altrichter and Boaglio 2004; Altrichter 2005). Of these, hunting pressure undoubtedly had the most negative impact until recently. All peccary species in the Chaco in all three countries are heavily hunted wherever they occur, even in national parks and reserve areas. Sowls (1984, 1997) has stated that the Chacoan Peccary constituted one of the most important sources of bush meat in the areas where they were previously abundant. Chacoan Peccary hides are thinner and much less valuable than those of the other peccary species. Fur buyers in Paraguay in 1988, for example, purchased <em>Catagonus</em> skins from settlers for about US$ 0.5 each compared to about US$ 8.0 for those of <em>Pecari tajacu</em> and US$ 5.0 for <em>Tayassu pecari </em>(Taber 1991).&#160;However, they still have been hunted and traded commercially. More recently, habitat destruction has become a major threat to this species. Although large tracts of intact bush survive, the rate of clearance for agriculture and cattle pasture in the Paraguayan and Argentinean Chaco is extremely high (Pearce 2011, Guyra Paraguay 2013). A study in the Argentine Chaco found that Chacoan Peccaries disappear when forest cover is reduced to less than 87% of the original cover (Altrichter and Boaglio 2004).<br/><br/>Estimated rates of decline are given below:<br/><br/>Argentina: From 1972 to 2001, 588,900 ha (<em>c</em>. 20% of the forests) was deforested at a rate of 2.2% a year. Assuming this rate has continued, and will continue, this implies a 33% habitat loss over a given 15 year period (three <em>Catagonus</em> generations). However, these total deforestation rates hide the impact of habitat degradation, which impacts virtually the whole area. Also, there are good reasons to believe that deforestation has greatly accelerated in the Argentine Chaco. The ongoing soy/commodity boom is having major impacts: e.g., over the last 10 years in the Chaco and Santiago del Estero provinces, soy cropland has grown from 284,000 ha to 1,513,000 ha. Some of this replaced smaller scale cotton cultivation, but most of this is new agro industrial expansions (Paolasso&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Goldfarb and Zoomers 2013). This is putting tremendous pressure on remaining forest habitat.<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">Paraguay: A recent publication reports an estimated loss of about 8,600 km<sup>2</sup> corresponding to 6.4% of the Dry Chaco forest from 1990 to 2000 (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2009). At present, most of previously isolated forest areas of the Chaco are undergoing land modification with estimates of 5 km<sup>2</sup> being cleared daily (Huang <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;The pressures of the habitat are definitively increasing, particularly in the prime <em>Catagonus </em>habitat in Central Chaco (A. Taber pers. comm., Guyra Paraguay 2013). The species probably only hangs on in the fringes of this area, as the far west is too dry for the species, and the east too wet. Proposals for major irrigation schemes from the Paraguay River which would further expand deforestation in the Central Chaco, and allow limited expansion to areas further west, are being discussed. Also, dryland-adapted transgenic crops (especially soy bean) are allowing more land to be put under extensive agriculture, further encroaching on the species in its prime habitat (Pearce 2011).<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">Bolivia: This situation is less critical in this country. The Kaa-Iya National Park in the north of the range provides the largest stronghold for the species and it is suspected that the dry Chaco in Chuquisaca and Tarija is in relatively good conservation status with low expansion of large-scale agriculture and ranching. However, the Chaco forest around Kaa Iya is being lost to new developments and subsistence hunting pressure is high. The species is considered as Endangered in the country by the Red Book (Tarifa and Aguirre 2009).<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/>Based on the above observations, an estimated present and future 50% loss of Chacoan Peccary habitat over a three-generation time period (15 years) is expected.

The species has disappeared from large areas of the Argentine Chaco where its original range has been reduced by approximately 40% (Altrichter and Boaglio 2004, Altrichter 2006). Its range has also been reduced in Bolivia (L. Maffei pers. comm.) and in the eastern Paraguayan Chaco (Neris <em>et al. </em>2002). The total population size is unknown, but a population of 5,000 individuals was estimated to survive in Paraguay in the early 1990s (Taber 1993). Using estimates of density and remaining habitat for <em>Catagonus i</em>n Argentina, M. Altrichter (pers. obs.) estimated a population of 3,200 individuals in 2002. This was before the massive deforestation of the region for soy bean and cattle ranching started in 2003.  In another study conducted in the Argentine Chaco, Altrichter and Boaglio (2004) found Chacoan Peccary to be the rarest of the three species of peccaries living in the area as well as being probably the most vulnerable to human disturbance.",Decreasing,"<span lang=""EN-US"">The Chacoan Peccary is endemic to the dry Chaco of western Paraguay, southeastern Bolivia and northern Argentina (Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Sowls 1984, Taber 1993).

In Argentina, Chacoan Peccary occurs in Chaco, Formosa, Salta and Santiago del Estero  Provinces. In Bolivia, it persists in the dry Chaco in the departments of Chuquisaca, Santa Cruz, and Tarija (Maffei <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).","This species is hunted mainly for food. There is some trade in its skin, but its hide is not valuable compared with the other peccary species.",Terrestrial,"This species is included on Appendix I of CITES. Hunting of all wildlife in Paraguay is officially prohibited. The species is also officially protected in Argentina, where its exportation, interprovincial traffic and commercial exploitation is illegal. Even so, the Chacoan Peccary is heavily hunted for its meat everywhere it occurs and existing regulations prohibiting its hunting are ignored and unenforced (Taber 1993, Altrichter 2005). There are only two national parks within this species' range in Paraguay, the Defensores del Chaco (7,800 km<sup>2</sup>) and Teniente Enciso (400 km<sup>2</sup>). In Bolivia this species occurs in and around the huge Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (34,400 km<sup>2</sup>)&#160;and it may be present in the west part of Otuquis National Park. In Argentina, the only protected areas containing Chacoan Peccaries are Copo National Park (1,140 km<sup>2</sup>), in Santiago del Estero province, and other small provincial reserves. <br/><br/>The species has proved difficult to establish in captivity. In 1985, the Chacoan Peccary was adopted for a Species Survival Plan (SSP) under the aegis of the Conservation Management Committee of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. The following year, a captive breeding station was established at Estancia Toledo, near Filadelfia, in the central Paraguayan Chaco, with funding from the Foundation for Endangered Animals, the Zoological Society of San Diego, and the Lincoln Park Zoo. Of the total of 44 wild caught adult and juvenile animals obtained for 'Proyecto Tagua' 31 died in captivity (Byrd <em>et al</em>. 1988, Benirschke <em>et al</em>. 1990, Unger 1992, Brooks pers. comm.). However, by 1992 the herd had grown to 44 animals the majority of which were born in captivity. In 1996 a mixed group of 10 animals were imported into the United States from the Paraguayan colony.<br/><br/>Priority conservation actions recommended for this species are: upgrade and expand the existing protected areas system within the dry Chaco of Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia; expand the private reserve system in the Chaco; establish an effective hunting ban on the species; develop an environmental education program; strengthen wildlife services in all three Chaco countries; improve and extend captive breeding initiatives; assess the feasibility of translocating wild caught peccaries into the national parks or other reserves from areas where the natural habitat is being destroyed; and conduct further research on various aspects of the Chacoan Peccary's reproductive biology, behaviour, ecology, range wide status, and future management needs both in the wild and in captivity (Taber 1993).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Predation by feral and domestic dogs may be important in some areas (Novaro 1997b).","Due to conflicts with humans (i.e., preying upon poultry and livestock, Crespo and De Carlo 1963, Bellati and von Thüngen 1990, Lucherini and Merino 2008) and because of its value as a furbearer, the Culpeo has been persecuted throughout its range for many decades (Jiménez 1993, Novaro 1995). Thus, current population numbers may be the result of past and present hunting pressure and food availability. The introduction of exotic prey species such as European Hares (<em>Lepus europaeus</em>) and rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>), as well as small-sized livestock into Chile and Argentina ca. 100 years ago, probably led to increases in the distribution and abundance of Culpeos, and facilitated their expansion towards the lowlands in eastern Argentina (Crespo and De Carlo 1963, Crespo 1975, Jiménez 1993, Jaksic 1998, Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2000a). The recent observation that the comeback of Pumas in Patagonia may be affecting negatively its abundance suggests that a reduction of intraguild competition/predation had also favoured this expansion in range. Currently, Culpeos range over a much wider area in Patagonia than previously. Likewise, in several areas of the desert of northern Chile, recent mining activities provide the Culpeo with resources such as food, water and shelter that were in much shorter supply in the past, and hence have changed their local distribution and abundance (Jiménez and Novaro 2004).<br/><br/>Culpeos appear to withstand intense hunting levels as shown by fur harvest data from Argentina and still maintain viable regional populations (Novaro 1995). However, this may only be possible through immigration from neighbouring unexploited areas that act as refugia (Novaro 1995). The Culpeo population in Neuquén Province in north-west Patagonia for example, appears to function as a source-sink system in areas where cattle and sheep ranches are intermixed (Novaro 1997b, Novaro <em>et al</em>. 2005). Cattle ranches where no hunting occurs supply disperser foxes that repopulate sheep ranches with intense hunting. Changes in sex ratio may be another mechanism that allows Culpeo populations to withstand intense hunting (Novaro 1995). Furthermore, large litter size and early maturity (Crespo and De Carlo 1963) could explain the Culpeo's high resilience to hunting.<br/><br/>When hunting pressure is reduced, Culpeo populations usually can recover quickly (Crespo and De Carlo 1963). This increase was observed at the Chinchilla National Reserve (Jiménez 1993) and at Fray Jorge National Park (Meserve <em>et al.</em> 1987, Salvatori <em>et al</em>. 1999), both in north-central Chile. Culpeo densities also have increased in many areas of Argentine Patagonia following the reduction of fur prices and hunting pressure in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Novaro 1997b, Novaro and Walker 2005). An exception to this response is the Culpeo population in Tierra del Fuego, where its populations are still declining in spite of several years of reduced hunting pressure (N. Loekemeyer and A. Iriarte, in Jiménez and Novaro 2004).<br/><br/>Estimates from intensive trapping by Crespo and De Carlo (1963) provided a density of 0.7 individuals/km² for north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Thirty years later, Novaro <em>et al</em>. (2000b), using line transects, reported densities of 0.2–1.3 individuals/km² for the same area. In north-central Chile, the ecological density of culpeos in ravines was 2.6 individuals/km², whereas the crude density (throughout the study site) was 0.3 individuals/km² (Jiménez 1993). In Torres del Paine, a crude density of 1.3 individuals/km² was reported based on sightings (J. Rau, in Jiménez and Novaro 2004). Interestingly, a later estimate for the same area, based on telemetry, rendered an ecological density of 1.2 individuals/km² (Johnson 1992, in Jiménez 1993).<br/><br/>Based on radio telemetry, sightings and abundance of faeces, Salvatori <em>et al</em>. (1999) concluded that Culpeos respond numerically to a decline in the availability of their prey in north-central Chile. Earlier, based on abundance of faeces, Jaksic <em>et al</em>. (1993) reached the same conclusion for the same Culpeo population. In contrast, Culpeos (not distinguished from sympatric Chillas) did not show a numerical or a functional response during a decline of their main prey at another site in north-central Chile (Jaksic <em>et al</em>. 1992).",Stable,"The Culpeo is distributed along the Andes and hilly regions of South America from Nariño and Putumayo&#160;Departments of south-west Colombia in the north (Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ramírez-Chaves <em>et al</em>. 2013; records from departments further north are dubious) to Tierra del Fuego in the south (Markham 1971, Redford and Eisenberg 1992). It ranges down to the Pacific shoreline in the desert of northern Chile (Mann 1945, Jiménez and Novaro 2004), south to about Valdivia (Osgood 1943) and then again in Magallanes. On the eastern slopes of the Andes, the Culpeo is found in Argentina from Jujuy Province in the North, reaching the Atlantic shoreline from Río Negro and southwards. This extended eastward distribution is relatively recent and was apparently favoured by sheep ranching, increased availability of exotic prey and extirpation of Puma (Crespo and De Carlo 1963, Novaro 1997a, Novaro and Walker 2005).&#160;However, in the last 10-15 years the shrinking of sheep production in Argentine Patagonia has facilitated Puma recolonization. The probable increase in predation or competitive exclusion by Pumas in turn appears to have caused declines in Culpeo populations (Travaini <em>et al</em>. 2007, A. Travaini pers. comm. 2015).","Until the early 1990s, the main cause of mortality was hunting and trapping for fur (Miller and Rottmann 1976, Novaro 1995). During 1986, in excess of 2,100 fox skins (Culpeo and Chilla) were exported from Chile (Iriarte <em>et al</em>. 1997). An average of 4,600 Culpeo pelts were exported annually from Argentina between 1976 and 1982, with a peak of 8,524 in 1977. Legal exports declined to an average of approximately 1,000 between 1983 and 1996 with peaks of 2,421 in 1990 and 4,745 in 1996 and have been negligible since 1997 (Novaro 1995, Jiménez and Novaro 2004).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Included on CITES – Appendix II.<br/><br/>The Argentine legislation about Culpeos is contradictory. Culpeos were considered ""Endangered"" by a 1983 decree of the Argentine Wildlife Board (Dirección de Fauna y Flora Silvestres), due to the numbers of Culpeo pelts traded during the 1970s and early 1980s. However, trade at the national level and export of Culpeo pelts was legal during that entire period and currently remains legal. Culpeos are legally hunted in 6 Argentine provinces and a bounty system is in place in two of them. The Culpeo's endangered status has never been revised in spite of marked changes in the fur trade and reports from monitoring programmes. However, it has been listed as Near Threatened in the most recent national Red List (Lucherini and Zapata 2012).&#160;The Tierra del Fuego population has been legally protected since 1985.&#160;<br/><br/>In Peru, the Culpeo is not considered endangered, but permits are issued by the government to hunt individuals depredating on livestock (D. Cossios pers. comm. 2015). Similarly, in Chile, where the species is listed as Least Concern, the Hunting of Culpeos is illegal (since 1980), but permits may be obtained for predator control (A. Iriarte and J. Jimenez, pers. comm. 2015).&#160;In Bolivia, although the fur export was banned in 1986 and hunting is illegal, Culpeos are commonly killed to reduce predation on livestock (Tarifa 1996, L.&#160;Pacheco pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The Argentine Wildlife Board is starting to develop a management plan for canids that will include the Culpeo. Five regional workshops that included wildlife agency officials from provincial governments, wildlife traders, conservationists, and scientists have been held in Argentine Patagonia to coordinate efforts to manage Culpeo populations in a sustainable manner and reduce sheep predation (Funes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>In Chile, the Culpeo occurs in the large majority of protected areas distributed throughout the country, encompassing all the habitats where it can be found. However, only 14% are large enough to support viable populations. In Argentina, the species occurs in 12 national parks and several provincial reserves, the majority of which probably support viable populations. In Peru, Culpeos occur in 18 (D. Cossios pers. comm. 2015) and in Bolivia in nine (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, L. Pacheco pers. comm. 2015) of each country's national system of protected areas.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>The Culpeo is common in zoos throughout Chile and Argentina.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species seems to be tolerant of human disturbance, being common in rural areas, where introduced exotic mammals could form the bulk of its food intake. There is no reason to believe the species is currently declining and the species is not considered threatened at present.","The Pampas Fox is a typical inhabitant of the Southern Cone Pampas grasslands. It prefers open habitats and tall grass plains and sub-humid to dry habitats, but is also common in ridges, dry scrub lands, coastal sand dunes, open woodlands, and in modified habitats, such as grazed pastures and croplands (Brooks 1992, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2008). In the driest habitats in the southerly and easterly parts of its range, the species is replaced by the Chilla. Where its range overlaps with that of the Crab-eating Fox, the Pampas Fox would select more open areas. Apparently, the Pampas Fox has been able to adapt to the alterations caused by extensive cattle breeding and agricultural activities to its natural habitats.<br/><br/>In a coastal area of northern Patagonia, the Pampas Fox used all available habitats (García and Kittlein 2005). Radio-collared Pampas Foxes preferred the most preserved habitats both in a natural grassland area and a cropland area of the Argentine Pampas. However, this preference was stronger in the most modified area (Luengos Vidal 2009).","The implementation of control measures (promoted by ranchers) by official organizations, coupled with the use of non-selective methods of capture such as poison, represent the main threats for the Pampas Fox. Fox control by government agencies involves the use of bounty systems without any serious studies on population abundance or the real damage that this species may cause. In rural areas, direct persecution in retaliation for or prevention of predation on lambs is also common, even where hunting is officially illegal and despite the true economic impact of predation being unquantified (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2008, M. Lucherini pers. obs. 2015).<br/><br/>Most of the species' range has suffered massive habitat alteration. For instance, the Pampas, which represents a large proportion of the species' distribution range, has been affected by extensive cattle breeding and agriculture. Approximately 0.1% of the original 500,000 km² range remains unaffected. However, due to the species' adaptability, the Pampas Fox seems able to withstand the loss and degradation of its natural habitat, as well as hunting pressure. Since no studies are available on its population dynamics in rural ecosystems, caution is required, since the sum of these threats may eventually promote the depletion of fox populations. Hunting pressure has resulted in diminished populations in the provinces of Tucumán (Barquez <em>et al.</em> 1991) and Salta (Cajal 1986) of north-western Argentina.","Little quantitative data are available on the abundance of Pampas Fox populations. Population densities of 1.8 individuals/km²&#160;and 1.1-1.5 individuals/km²&#160;were estimated for the Bolivian Chaco (Ayala and Noss 2000) and a protected area of central Argentina (Luengos Vidal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), respectively. Although no long-term population monitoring has been carried out, populations generally are considered stable.<br/><br/>In the coastal area of central Argentina, a study based on scent-stations found that Pampas Fox signs were more frequent than Molina's Hog-nosed Skunk (<em>Conepatus chinga</em>) and Grison (<em>Galictis cuja</em>) (García and Kittlein 2005). Similarly, the frequency of observation of Pampas Fox was higher than that of&#160;Molina's Hog-nosed Skunk, Grison, and Geoffroy's Cat (<em>Leopardus</em><em>&#160;geoffroyi</em>) both in a Sierra grassland area and in a cropland area of Buenos Aires Province (Luengos <em>et al</em>. 2005). Recent camera trapping data indicate that it is the most common carnivore in an area of 27,300 km² of the Argentine Espinal (Caruso 2015). In areas where the Pampas Fox is sympatric with the Crab-eating Fox (<em>Cerdocyon thous</em>), the former would be more abundant in open habitats, while the latter would more frequently inhabit woodland areas (Vieira and Port 2007, Di Bitetti <em>et al</em>. 2009, Faria-Corrêa <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The Pampas Fox seems to be tolerant of human disturbance, being common in rural areas, where introduced exotic mammals, such as the European hare (<em>Lepus europaeus</em>), could form the bulk of its food intake (Crespo 1971, Farias and Kittlein 2008, D. Birochio and M. Lucherini pers. obs.).",Stable,"The Pampas Fox inhabits the Southern Cone of South America, occupying chiefly the Chaco, Argentine Monte, Argentine Espinal and Pampas eco-regions (Lucherini <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2008). It ranges from eastern Bolivia, western Paraguay and east of Salta, Catamarca, San Juan, La Rioja and Mendoza provinces in Argentina, to the Atlantic coast; and from south-eastern Brazil to the Río Negro Province, Argentina, in the south. Information on the limits of its distribution and the extent to which it overlaps with Chilla (<em>Lycalopex griseus</em>) is uncertain.","Rural residents have traditionally hunted the Pampas Fox for its fur, and this activity has been an important source of income for them. From 1975 to 1985, <em>Lycalopex </em>fox skins (mostly belonging to <em>L. gymnocercus</em>; García Fernández 1991) were among the most numerous to be exported legally from Argentina (Chebez 1994). Further, some authors have pointed out that Argentine exports corresponding to the Chilla historically included other species, such as the Crab-eating Fox and the Pampas Fox (Ojeda and Mares 1982, García Fernandez 1991). However, exports have declined from the levels of the early and mid-1980s mainly due to a decline in demand (Novaro and Funes 1994). Today, the trade in Pampas Fox is banned, and no statistical information on the fur harvest is available.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Included in CITES – Appendix II.<br/><br/>In Argentina, it was declared not threatened in 1983 and its trade was prohibited in 1987. However, this species continues to be hunted and demand for its fur exists.&#160;In Uruguay, all foxes are protected by law, and the only legal exception is the government's so-called ""control hunting permission"", which does not allow the taking of animals for the fur trade. The situation is very similar in Paraguay.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Although it occurs in a number of protected areas in Argentina, the proportion of its range under protection is low in this country. In Uruguay, the Pampas Fox has been reported in many protected areas; however, illegal hunting of foxes still occurs within these areas (Y.

85628124,41790,Rusa unicolor,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Sambar is listed as Vulnerable through sustained declines across its range. These vary in severity between regions, and in some areas considerably exceed the threshold for Vulnerable. In the last three generations (taken to be 24–30 years), declines in mainland South-east Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia), Bangladesh, and possibly Borneo and Sumatra have exceeded 50%, probably by a substantial margin. Despite this Sambar remains common in some localized logged, unprotected areas on Borneo, such as the Hose Mountains of Sarawak (where a national park is proposed but not yet enforced), but only where human access is difficult. The overall decline rate in India has been less, given the presence of large populations in a fair number of well-secured protected areas which have probably remained stable, but a decline rate averaging 30% is reasonable in India outside these areas (i.e. in the less effective protected areas and outside the protected areas network), and in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The situation in China is unclear as in some areas, for example Hainan, population recovery may be occurring, whilst major declines in other regions may have taken place prior to the 24–30 year assessment window; the population on Taiwan appears to be relatively stable. Although declines seem to be reversing very locally in a few sites, these numbers are a very small proportion of the whole population. There is no indication that declines will, at the species level, slow until populations are extinguished outside well-secured protected areas, which currently comprise only a small proportion of protected areas holding the species. Current trends of wild meat and antler marketing in South-east Asia and China suggest declines have probably sped up in some areas especially Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Since the 2008 assessment trends in wildlife exploitation and natural habitat conversion in mainland Southeast Asia, have if anything increased, thus although the relative size of the Southeast Asian population subcomponent has probably decreased compared with that in South Asia, the rate of decline has probably increased. The global population trend is still considered to be a decline somewhere between 30 and 50 % over three generations, for the past, present and future.&#160;The fact that Sambar is at least locally common in a number of high profile protected areas, such as Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and Cat Tien National Park, Viet Nam, and is commonly kept captive and proliferates in menageries in the region, was probably a significant factor in the failure to recognize the plight of the species prior to the 2008 reassessment. These same factors no doubt still to some degree cloud the issue.","No large Indian ungulate has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions than has Sambar (Schaller 1967). Within India, Sambar occurs in the thorn and arid forests of Gujarat and Rajasthan, in the moist and dry deciduous forests throughout peninsular India, in the pine and oak forests at the Himalayan foothills, and in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of northeastern India and the Western Ghats (Sankar and Acharya 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Outside India it extends into temperate-latitude and alpine-zone woodlands of Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). This habitat flexibility is permitted by its broad diet: Sambar has been documented to eat 130–180 species of plants in India alone (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh and Sankar 1991, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), with food requirements less specialised than those of other deer (Schaller 1967). Sambar grazes or browses depending upon the forage available at that time (Schaller 1967, Richardson 1972, Martin 1977, Bentley 1978, Dinerstein 1979, Kelton and Skipworth 1987, Ngampongsai 1987, Sankar 1994, Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Across the very wide altitudinal range occupied in Taiwan, the diet varies reflecting major changes in plant communities (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). Sambar was found to live in much higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests of Nagarahole National Park (Karanth and Sunquist 1992) and there are no doubt also patterns of habitat selection across the rest of its range. Although the highest densities of Sambar so far recorded were in the semi-arid forests of Ranthambore (Kumar 2000), across most of its Indian range Sambar seems to thrive best in well-watered, moist deciduous hilly terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The Sambar occurs up to at least 3,825 m on Siouguluan Mountain, the highest peak of the Central Mountains in Taiwan; elsewhere on the island it ranges down to 150 m asl, mostly living at 2,000–3,500 m (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). It occurs up to 3,000 m on Gunung Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Myanmar, recent camera-trap photographs spanned the range of 0–2,150 m asl (Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is largely restricted to hilly terrain in the Terai Arc Landscape (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), although how much this reflects real habitat selection and how much it is an artificial pattern produced by human effects (habitat conversion and hunting) is unclear. More widely in India, there does seem to be a marked preference for undulating terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar usage was greater of the higher than the lower altitude area. However, it makes wide use of plains areas elsewhere, where these have not been destroyed, e.g. the Hukaung Valley in Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008).In Borneo, while Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered Sambar “most common in secondary forests of gently-sloping terrain” they also knew of occurrence in “tall dipterocarp forests on steep terrain and in swamp forests”. In Thung Yai, Thailand, Sambar signs were twice as abundant in lowland forest as in montane forest, although this difference was not statistically significant (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Across seven sites in Thailand, places where sambar was detected had shallower slopes, more open habitat, were closer to streams, closer to roads and villages, and had lower rainfall (Lynam <em>et al. </em>2012).In Southeast Asian regions of dense evergreen closed-canopy forest, Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978, Heydon 1994, Stuebing 1995, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Sabah, Sambar was camera-trapped in both mature and young forest stands (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). All the remaining Lao populations are centred around areas with extensive open, or at least broken, habitat amid forest (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), and the general paucity of records from the interiors of large blocks of closed-canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which generally support the least depleted large mammal populations, probably reflects natural patterns of habitat occupation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Similarly, in extensive tracts of deciduous dipterocarp forest the species occurs primarily around patches of denser habitats, and this seems to be a natural rather than hunting-led pattern (Timmins and Ou 2001). In this sense, in Indochina Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em> is much more tolerant and versatile than is Sambar. In southern and central India where much of the forest is deciduous, Sambar is a true forest ungulate and conspicuously avoids disturbed and open forests, and is highly sensitive to any sort of forest resource extractive activities (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar was primarily in areas of high tree and herb density with low shrub density. O'Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) found no statistically significant difference in Sambar abundance between areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and those deep in the interior of the park. Caution is needed in inferring that there is truly no association of Sumatran Sambar with forest edges (which would be astonishing by comparison with its habitat use elsewhere) because the study does not specify whether this ‘non-significant’ result might simply reflect methodological factors rather than a genuine lack of biological effect (see, e.g., Johnson 1999). Despite the population rises that occur in post-logging forest, there is no evidence that Sambar can survive landscape-level conversion to exotic plantations or other non-forest land-uses, although many live in coconut plantations (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and it is relatively common in immature <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations within the matrix of plantation and natural forest of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;Camera trapping in oil palm plantations adjacent to Danum Valley in Sabah suggest that the species does not utilize plantations (Yue and J. Brodie unpublished data).A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Sambar only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007). In forest protected areas of Thailand such as Khao Yai National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sambar populations are often concentrated around anthropogenic grass and scrub (e.g. sites of former villages) rather than in the forest itself (Trisurat <em>et al</em>. 1996; Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and this also seems to be true on remote parts of the Bolaven Plateau of south Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Annamite mountains of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Sambar seems often to be associated with degraded valley bottom areas, largely the result of long human influence: although the effects of a permanent water source and differences in terrain in determining distribution are difficult to disentangle (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar regularly visits salt licks (e.g. Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007), perhaps especially when growing new antlers. This predictability exposes it to high levels of hunting, where this is not effectively controlled. It seems that within an area, not all sort of licks are visited. At the Seima Biodivesity Conservation Area, Cambodia, Sambar photographs were initially very few at mineral lick camera-traps. But in 2007, cameras placed on trails and at some permanent water sources (especially in semi-evergreen forest) recorded Sambar much more often. Checking tracks at more than 40 licks indicated that some were used by Sambar and Red Muntjac, but not Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> or Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, while the big ones with many cattle and elephant prints had few Sambar prints (E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar was considered to be mostly nocturnal by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004), to show ‘no pattern’ (meaning unclear; perhaps intended to imply no significant variation through the 24-hour cycle, although this is itself a pattern) by O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003), and to be cathemeral by van Schaik and Griffiths (1996). In fact, its activity pattern may vary across sites, but in general it is mostly crepuscular, with significant nocturnal activity as well (Schaller 1967; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is essentially non-social, stable groups being at most family associations (Schaller 1967; Karanth and Sunquist 1992). However, it is often in groups, presumably temporary, of 12–30 in dry deciduous and semi-arid forests of India (e.g. Bandipur, Pench, Melghat and Ranthambore) (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and the same is true around the secondary grasslands within Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). During peak summer, such associations of up to 80–100 near large waterbodies are not uncommon in Pench in central India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A detailed review of information on grouping in Sambar is in Sankar and Acharya (2004). Results from many areas show a strong bias in sex ratio to females, perhaps reflecting selective predation; alternatively, stags may be more vulnerable to stress (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Breeding is rather seasonal in most areas where studied, for example Schaller (1967) reported that in Kanha the rut spreads over a period of at least seven months with a peak in November–December. Stags during the rut sometimes can cover large distances, up to 10–20 km in one night. Further information for India is reviewed in Sankar and Acharya (2004). The bucks of Formosan Sambar have a seasonal antler cycle, and the mating season is from June to January with a peak in September–October. Males wallow and mark with scent glands in this season. Fawns are born (usually singly) from March to August, with a peak in May and June (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Predation appears to be the major cause of Sambar mortality. In Bandipur, Sambar is one of the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (31%), Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> (8%) and Dhole <em>C. alpinus</em> (13%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur Sambar remains were found in about 22.3% of Tiger faeces, 6.1% of Leopard faeces and 7.3% of Dhole faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, proportion of Sambar in Tiger’s diet was about 25–29%, derived from faeces and kill data respectively (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Sambar together with Gaur contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). Sambar occurred in 50% of Tiger scats in Pench-Maharashtra (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Sambar together with Gaur are selectively predated by Tiger.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region and in much of the rest of Sambar’s range. Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow <em>Capricornis crispus</em> and Reeves’s Muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).<br/><br/>There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats <em>Panthera</em>) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs <em>Munitacus</em> spp.<br/><br/>Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (<span lang=""EN-US"">A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002,&#160;J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km<sup>2</sup> per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing,&#160;as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press).&#160;Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.<br/><br/>On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and muntjacs <em>Muntiacus</em>) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001).&#160;Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).<br/><br/><p> </p>  <p>In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of <em>Acacia mangium</em> although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments.&#160;The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p>Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). &#160;If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound.</p><p><br/></p> Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brodie <em>et al. </em>in press b, c). Degradation <em>per se</em> is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2014; Lynam<em> et al.</em> 2012, Brodie<em> et al.</em> in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species. &#160;In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.<br/> <br/> Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa <em>Rusa timorensis</em> has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital <em>Axis axis</em> (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.</span>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Almost everywhere outside Taiwan and <span lang=""EN-GB"">well-managed protected areas<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">in India, the Sambar is in rapid decline, which has lead to very low numbers and many local-level extinctions over a wide area. The occasional healthy populations reflecting special circumstances. Few surveys specifically target Sambar, but a reasonable picture of its current status is emerging through surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris </em>and through general wildlife surveys. Tiger-oriented camera-trapping predictably yields photographs of Sambar when it is present, and most Tiger surveys afford priority to elucidating Sambar status as a key prey, and therefore population determinant, of Tiger. Understanding Sambar status through surveys of Tigers or, sometimes, of Leopard <em>P. pardus </em>(e.g. Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2007) needs care, because such surveys have generally selected the best remaining areas for very large mammals within the country or region in question, so as to maximize chances of picking up Tigers. They therefore cannot be seen as indicative of Sambar status in the wider landscape. Most importantly, in the several cases (identified below) where such surveys have found few Sambar, these indicate cause for alarm, because there is little reason to believe that there ought to be larger populations in many other areas in the country or region in question, even though large parts of it may remain unsurveyed. Occasional herds can survive in unexpected places through atypical site-specific circumstances in some countries (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Populations outside the native range are not treated here, as they are irrelevant to assigning the Red List Category and Criteria.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Sri Lanka, numbers have probably declined substantially through poaching which increased during the civil war. Poaching occurred widely across the country, including within protected areas, particularly where there are concentrations of resettled refugees (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/> <br/> In India, although the Sambar occurs widely and in many habitat types, and large populations occur in well-secured protected areas, nowhere is it now regionally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004); although see below.

Similar surveys at Kaziranga found too few Sambar to estimate populations there (Karanth and Nichols 2000), this presumably representing habitat characters rather than defective protection, given the buoyant populations of other deer at that site (Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and forest-resource extraction (Jathanna <em>et al. </em>2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data as of 2008).<span lang=""EN-GB""> Local population trends in well protected reserves appear to be stable and even increasing in areas recently freed from anthropogenic pressures (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. But in poorly protected reserved forests subject to hunting and heavy cattle grazing, Sambar density seems to be extremely low; certainly too low to permit actual estimation of density (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">Outside protected areas, Sambar is present mostly in very low numbers, although larger numbers can still be found where its habitat is almost inaccessible to people (Anonymous 2008).<br/> <br/> Nepal supports an important population in Bardia National Park (Dinerstein 1979). This remains healthy and there are also good populations in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Across the country Sambar has declined so rapidly and so widely that it is now very rare outside protected areas, mostly recorded as isolated reports from forests adjoining these protected areas, and from south-east Nepal. Sambar has been victim of poachers, probably because of its large size (thus, more meat per animal and, for males, a more impressive trophy), perhaps compounded by nocturnal and relatively docile nature; recent declines are of the magnitude to meet IUCN criteria for Vulnerable on a national assessment (all information: Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). It is unclear whether the demand for antler in velvet in eastern Asia is stimulating poaching in Nepal.<br/> <br/> No information concerning current status was traced from Bhutan but (simply on an area basis) numbers are unlikely to be large enough to influence the overall global population trend.<br/> <br/> In Bangladesh, the Sambar was common in the north-east, south-east and hill-tract forests in the 1960s (Khan 1985) but now is restricted to the forest fragments of the southeast, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar occurrence in protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and eco parks) is now doubtful and all recent records and reports have come from outside protected areas from areas that were largely inaccessible to the majority of people prior to 1997 due to insurgency (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar was detected by camera-trapping at 22 of 38 surveyed grid cells (each &gt;50% forest cover&#160; and 10,000 ha) in the CHT during 2010-2011, but it was assumed that outside the survey area, Sambar was either absent or occurred in very low numbers (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Within the best two grid cells (rated in terms of forest cover, inaccessibility and presence of Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>) detection rate of Sambar was 2.07 independent photos/100 camera trap nights. Following the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladesh Government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (the political organization of CHT indigenous people) both the rate of habitat loss and hunting pressure have been accelerating in the period after 1997 (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). There is no sign of significant change in either factor in near future and if current habitat loss and hunting rates continue indefinitely extirpation of sambar is likely within the next 30 years (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""> In China there were major declines in Sambar over much of the twentieth century, and populations probably decreased by more than 50% in the 30 years from 1978 to 2008; records from Guangxi suggest that, there at least, the 1970s–1980s was the era of fastest decline (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008; B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). In some provinces populations seem now to have stabilized, and in some areas, particularly in Hainan (where several apparently stabilised populations are present, but all are small, reflecting habitat patch size: the largest may be of only a few hundred animals) and north Guangdong province (perhaps also the east of that province, where there is a nature reserve specifically for the species), populations may even have been increasing once again in the last few years. This is not so for Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Further north, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei, a multi-method Tiger survey in 2001 found that Sambar is very rare overall and scattered in present-day distribution (Tilson <em>et al.</em> 2004). For elsewhere in China, Smith and Xie Yan (2008) mapped wide presence in Sichuan, plus isolated populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, and Fujian. The original sources are not clear, and R. Harris (pers. comm.) doubts that Sambar has lived anywhere in Qinghai in recent times. <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, numbers and geographic distribution reduced rapidly through hunting before 1987, then expanded somewhat since the mid 1990s reflecting reductions in hunting. The average population density in the Yu-Li Wildlife Refuge was 10.6 animals per km² in 2005. In some areas at high altitude, densities exceed 40 animals per km², and the animals have a large impact on the coniferous saplings in this area. But at low to mid altitude, hunting pressure remains high enough to restrain their distribution and density. Based on the known geographical distribution, there are five populations: A-Yu Mountain, Nanhu, Shei-Pa, Jade Mountains–Central Mountains, and Tawu. The A-Yu population was re-introduced (about 70 animals) by local deer farmers in 1988–1991, when the velvet price was very low through the impact of deer TB in 1985. This population has not expanded reflecting continuous poaching; it may be genetically polluted. The other four populations are all natural, assumed to be isolated by cross-island roads, and may have very low gene flows with each other. Sambar is largely restricted to protected areas, only occurring outside them in a few nearby areas. The population sizes and distributions in these areas are smaller than in the protected areas. The poaching pressure is an important limitation to Sambar in these unprotected areas (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Myanmar, Sambar was detected at 12 of 15 camera-trapped Tiger sites during 1999–2002, indicating that it was still widespread (Lynam 2003). Sambar meat and antlers were commonly found in local markets in the Hukaung Valley in 2002 (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014) indicating heavy hunting pressure, possibly partially explaining extremely low densities of tigers in the area at that time (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; The Myanmar Forest Department and Wildlife Conservation Society have since jointly (as of May 2008) camera-trapped 21 survey areas (including the earlier 15) and found Sambar in 13 (S. Htun pers. comm. 2008). This lower ratio of proven presence indicates how the areas selected for Tiger survey were above average for prey and may indicate increasing local-level extinctions. For example, in a multi-method study of one area not expected to hold Tiger, hunted animals showed that Sambar still occurred in Naungmung and Machanbaw (south of Hkakaborazi National Park, Kachin state), but it was so scarce that it was not detected by substantial amounts of either camera trapping or sign surveys (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005). Even within these best areas, large declines are suspected and overall national population losses of about 50% over the last 25–30 years and in the following such period are likely (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006; Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Thailand, several protected areas maintain big Sambar populations; these are mostly large with very few or no people living within them. Over much of the country Sambar is extinct or very nearly so, including in many protected areas, particularly in the north where most parks are small and heavily poached (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is rare in most areas of Thung Yai Naresuan, where commercial hunting has targeted large ungulates (Steinmetz <em>et al. </em>2008). Sambar was recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations during a Leopard survey in Kaeng Krachan National Park, and clearly remains widespread there. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert et al. 2007). Sambar is also locally abundant in Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam et al. 2006), and the remote core zone of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). In Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary current Sambar density is about 2–3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and it seems to be increasing (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Lao PDR, Sambar was described as very common throughout the wooded parts by Delacour (1940). Some decades later, the species was reported during 86% of 1988–1993 village interviews (n = 328) and was then still widespread throughout, except in the most heavily settled areas (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999: Annex 5). However, sightings on surveys during 1992–1998 were very rare, and while calls heard by night and signs indicate a wide distribution, numbers are heavily depressed (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001). Only in Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA did Sambar seem at least locally abundant (Davidson 1998), and reasonable populations were confirmed still to persist in 2003–2004 (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004); an exceptional area in an Indochinese context, that still supported significant Tiger numbers in 2008 (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010). The Nakai Plateau and the mountainous interior of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and a few other, localized, areas of Lao PDR, including the Dong Kalo tract of Xe Pian NPA, the Nam Hiang area of the Bolaven Plateau, and parts of Nam Kading NPA also seemed to support relatively high densities during the mid 1990s. The few sites resurveyed during 2004–2007 have in general shown major declines (e.g. Timmins and Robichaud 2005). There was not a single camera-trap photograph during fairly intensive camera-trapping in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2007, although the species has subsequently been found to persist in a few parts of the protected area (Johnson and Johnston 2007; W.G. Robichaud and Nam Theun Watershed Management Protection Authority pers. comm. 2008) and it is not clear whether quirks of camera-trap placement (e.g., hypothetically, a focus on slopes rather than valley bottoms) may have been a major contributor to the lack of photographs. The Nakai Plateau still supports noteworthy numbers in a Lao context, but even here there were signs of decline (Dersu 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014) and no Sambar were camera-trapped in Xe Sap NPA during relatively extensive camera-trapping (~40 sites, ~5,000 trap-nights) in 2012 and 2013 (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). Surprisingly, given the proximity to China and Viet Nam, a good population was found to persist in Phou Dendin NPA in the far north-east of Lao PDR in 2004–2005 (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). In sites surveyed since 2008 evidence for persistence has been found in most large forest blocks (e.g. &gt;50,000 ha), although nowhere common, but generally not in small and isolated fragments, while in many areas of the country evidence suggests increasing levels of hunting especially commercial scale snaring (SUFORD 2010, Duckworth in press, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2014, 2009, in press b, Woxvold 2009, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Viet Nam, in most of the northern highlands, in particular, and all other areas of Viet Nam to an increasing extent, Sambar is very rare or has been hunted out from many areas of otherwise suitable habitat (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999; Grieser Johns 2000; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014; B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping studies in Pu Mat National Park, Thua Thien Hue province and Quang Nam province between 1998 and 2007 recorded only a handful of records and local communities in all these areas report a major decline in numbers (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Greater than 19,000 camera-trap nights from &gt;100 locations in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves detected the species from only one location (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). With so many higher-profile species long listed as threatened on the Red List, many of them with restricted ranges, the status of Sambar in Viet Nam has largely been ignored, and the paucity of evidence during many surveys has rarely been highlighted in reviews. As with many large mammals, populations were thought to be best in southern parts of the country, but even here hunting pressure is high in most remaining forest areas, and Sambar is thought to be scarce to extirpated in most remaining forest areas (a high proportion of which is within protected areas) (Timmins in press a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). It was not considered at all common in surveys of several areas of prime habitat in Dak Lak Province in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997). In a three week survey of forest in western Dak Nong Province only a single Sambar was detected on the basis of signs, this despite the area being contiguous with Seima PF in Cambodia (Timmins in press a). It remains locally common in Cat Tien National Park (Polet and Ling 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), but this is very much the exception to the species status in almost all protected areas in Viet Nam (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, Sambar “appears to be at least relatively common in some areas, though entirely absent from others, a feature which appears to have a strong correlation to local hunting pressure. At the current rate of persecution, this species is likely to decline sharply over the next few years (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the 2008 assessment Sambar was considered “still widespread, although heavily targeted by hunters and most populations are now very depressed (Timmins and Men 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, Timmins 2006)”. However substantial declines have certainly occurred since that time (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), as a result of increasing hunting pressure, especially in the east because of Vietnamese driven trade (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Timmins in press a), but elsewhere because of increasing ease of access to forest areas as a result of infrastructure development, settlement of frontier forest areas and agriculture and forestry concession developments (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). <span lang=""EN-GB"">In Seima PF, Phnom Prich WS, and Mondulkiri PF Sambar densities are considered too low to allow density and population estimation, although behaviour is also thought to contribute to the low detection rate on line transects there (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The population is almost certainly smaller even than that of wild oxen, and probably numbers in the low hundreds of animals (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). Sambar densities are low throughout the Eastern Plains (e.g. Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011; Timmins and Ou Ratanak 2001), almost certainly a result of targeted hunting in combination with the ecological association of Sambar with ‘edge’-type habitats and riparian corridors. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the eastern plains of Cambodia, where populations of many other ungulates were and still are magnitudes more numerous than in other areas of Indochina, Sambar numbers are clearly low, almost certainly as a result of targeted hunting: numbers in some areas seem depressed even well below those of wild cattle (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014;&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Gray <em>et al. </em>2013, 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins and Ou 2001). Protection activities in a few localised areas appeared initially to have stabilized declines up to c. 2008, but this was an exception to a general scenario of rapid decline, and now it appears that even in these reasonably well managed areas with significant resources input into protection and law enforcement activities that hunting pressure is rising in intensity, presumably largely because of the increasing lucrative nature of the trade in wildlife, rather than a decrease in protection efforts, augmented somewhat by the greater connectivity and better infrastructure connecting wildlife sources to markets (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, J. Khamler pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). These declines are evidently faster and more recent than in either Lao PDR or Viet Nam, reflecting the rapid pace of change of economic and logistical factors in Cambodia since the mid 1990s. Since the species' assessment in 2008 this rate of decline has almost certainly increased, perhaps even by an order of magnitude (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The primary reason for this increase has been the rapid economic growth that Cambodia has seen in the intervening period, particularly the rapid development of agro-industry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). This by itself would not necessarily lead to major declines in Sambar, but the infrastructural development associated with agricultural concessions has created easy access to huge areas of formerly relatively remote forest areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Even protected areas are not secure, with legal concessions granted within the former boundaries of even those with strong international support (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2014). At the same time illegal exploitation of the rich natural resources of Cambodia has increased, as commodity values have increased, as access to these resources has increased and as regional cross-border natural resource trade networks have become stronger (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Recent studies have confirmed what was earlier suspected that Sambar populations even in some of the areas of best wildlife status are highly depressed, but more worryingly however there are no signs of a significant recovery in such areas and hunting pressure may in fact be increasing despite concerted resource investment in protected area management, particularly law enforcement strategies, from international NGOs (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2011; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; S. Brook pers. comm. 2014; J. Kamler pers. comm. 2014). Although the rates of decline have been increasing in Cambodia, concurrently as the numbers of animals remaining have decreased, the influence of the Cambodian population status on the global population trend has probably changed little (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> For a review of the species status in Peninsula Malaysia Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2014) considered that the rate of decline was sufficient to warrant an Endangered listing, i.e. a 50% or greater decline. This conclusion was based on several lines of evidence, most notably the results of camera-trapping surveys showing absence and or low densities in a majority of remaining forest areas, and rates of forest loss. Camera-trapping studies between 1998 and 2008 over more than 20,000 trap days, detected Sambar (68 photographs) in only 3 of 18 Permanent Reserved Forests, but detected the species in all five protected areas surveyed (346 photographs in c. 19,900 trap-days) (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">), however the species was only commonly detected (e.g. capture rate &gt;1/25 trap nights) in two PAs Taman Negara K Koh and Endau Rompin and one PRF Temenggor. Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) like the majority of the studies that formed part of the synthesis of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>(2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">) was specifically aimed at Tigers and their prey, and hence camera-traps were set specifically with Sambar detection in mind, the results are thus particularly informative of Sambar status; during the study Sambar was photographed at only one of the nine areas surveyed during 1997–1999, Temenggor, where it was the most commonly photographed mammal (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In more recent studies from 2009 to 2013 totalling more than 40,000 trap days focused on three national priority tiger conservation landscapes Sambar was detected by camera-trapping in only four of ten forest units surveyed, with presence confirmed in another through observational surveys of signs, but was only commonly detected in one, Royal Belum State Park (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">). The high incidence of muntjac and pig pictures in both earlier and later periods of survey clearly indicate that the results are indicative of Sambar status rather than an issue with camera-trapping methodology. &#160;In the 1990s, Sambar was found in only one of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas) in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves, making it the most localized mammal species visually detected on forest transects (Laidlaw 2000, K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 2014). The occupied site was a logged area (Laidlaw 2000). None was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006; one of the 23 studies assessed by <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Camera-trapping and sign-based survey studies in Taman Negara NP have independently corroborated declines in Sambar numbers between c. 2000 and 2010 (<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Crude density estimates based of photographic capture-recapture analysis of individually recognizable stags (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) declined from 0.20 to 0.01 animals per km<sup>2</sup> while the occupancy estimate declined from 0.54 to 0.19 in Taman Negara. It is possible that the Sambar density was always low in the primary rainforest but the species is now extirpated in a forest reserve and disturbed unprotected forest adjacent to the Taman Negara sampling area (K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-US"">. <br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">An analysis of potential Sambar range in West Malaysia calculated a c. &gt;25% loss of potentially suitable forest between 1980 and c. 2010 (<span lang=""EN-GB"">DWNP 2010<span lang=""EN-US"">). Serious recent declines are also corroborated by an interview survey of hunters in which over 80% of 61 interviewees from throughout Peninsula Malaysia considered declines had occurred (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Goldthorpe and Neo 2011<span lang=""EN-US"">), and a decline in the number of hunting licences issued for Sambar (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi 2008,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

Sambar appears to remain fairly common in three of the eight sites, the Maliau Basin and Danum Valley in Sabah, where protection from hunting is reasonably good and the Hose Mountains of Sarawak which are relatively inaccessible (Brodie et al. in press a, b, <span lang=""EN-US"">J. Brodie in litt. 2014). Sambar was found to be present but uncommon in the remaining areas of Mulu National Park (Sarawak), Pulong Tau National Park (Sarawak), the Ulu Padas region (Sabah), the Ulu Trusan region (Sarawak), and the Ulu Baram (Sarawak) (Brodie <em>et al.</em> in press, <span lang=""EN-US"">J.

Other populations previously reported to be in reasonable condition include those in <span lang=""EN-US"">Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005), and Deramakot Forest Reserve (Matsubayashi <em>et al.</em> 2007) both in Sabah. Sambar has been extirpated or persists only at extremely low densities in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia (Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006). An intensive survey of Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, found Sambar only once; this was stated to be a genuine reflection of actual rarity, and to result from intensive hunting at salt-licks (Meredith 1995). Across Sarawak and to a lesser extent Sabah it is seriously reduced by hunting (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2000, see Threats; A.C.

Hedges pers. comm. 2008), but in these areas it was recorded rather rarely by comparison with other ungulates. Sambar was nearly six times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting, and reduced populations overall (O'Brien&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003). In Way Kambas National Park the population is reportedly stable (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Overall in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Sambar is not under major threat except where forest is being converted (i.e. most of the lowlands). Reflecting this, E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) considered the status of Sambar, in suitable habitat, to be much more healthy there than in Cambodia and Viet Nam, although there is a significant market for Sambar antlers in Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"The Sambar extends from India and Sri Lanka east along the southern Himalayas (including Nepal and Bhutan) through much of south China (including Hainan Island) to Taiwan (where it occurs in the central and eastern parts; Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comms. 2008). Further south it occurs in Bangladesh, throughout mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, West Malaysia) and many of the main islands of the Greater Sundas (excepting Java): Sumatra, Siberut, Sipora, Pagi and Nias islands (all Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) (Grubb 2005). The current distribution is now highly fragmented in much of this range (see Population). Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) also listed the Philippines, but the Sambar does not occur there. A record from Ujung Kulon, Java, in van Schaik and Griffiths (1996: 107) is presumably an error for Javan Deer <em>R. timorensis</em>. The Sambar has been introduced widely outside its native range, e.g.: San Luis Obispo Country, California; the Gulf Prairies and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Ables and Ramsey 1974); the St. Vincent Islands, Franklin Country, Florida (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1990); Australia (Slee 1984, Freeland 1990); New Zealand (Kelton and Skipworth 1987); and Western Cape Province, South Africa (Lever 1985). These introduced populations are not included on the distribution map.","The Sambar is hunted for sport, food, medicinal products and other purposes. It is uncertain how many captive animals are kept within the native range, potentially larger herds occur in countries where introduced, and the comparative contributions of wild and captive sourced products to markets is unknown - the markets may be somewhat separate.",Terrestrial,"The Sambar is found in many protected areas throughout its range, although in most of these areas this legal status has not stemmed declines and local extinctions from hunting. Similarly, although it is protected from hunting by legislation, even outside protected areas, in most or all range states, these laws are challenging to enforce, given the trade demand for meat and antlers (GMA Indonesia Workshop).&#160;In Sarawak, Borneo, unfortunately,&#160;Sambar&#160;is not on the protected list of Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1998 (a,b) (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Currently the law has a strong protective effect in Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008) and in various protected areas of India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, Sambar declines have lagged behind those of other sympatric deer (excepting muntjacs). There is no doubt that within a decade or two Sambar will be, like Hog Deer and Eld’s Deer are already, almost absent from South-east Asia unless effective protection from trade-driven hunting is instituted. In India the species’s status is less grim, and this is dependent upon continuation of the current protected areas system, and the expansion of effective threat reduction into a greater proportion of protected areas: in many Indian protected areas, poaching is rampant and in such vulnerable areas Sambar numbers are still declining. Given the major challenges combating hunting of such a desired animal, long-term survival is most realistic in large protected areas (exceeding 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> where possible), lacking people living within them, with an adequate number of motivated and capable staff (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008, A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). The precise ways for protected areas to function effectively in the conservation of large mammals depend upon their own specific circumstances, but field presence of staff, dispersed across the area, is likely to be important in almost every area. For example, Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2006) found in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, that encounter rates of tracks and signs of Sambar (and other large mammals) decreased with distance from ranger substations. Deep inside the forest to the south and east, far away from ranger substations, Sambar was locally extinct. Similar patterns are shown by current Sambar distributions in other Thai protected areas such as Khao Sok, Phu Khieo and Kaeng Krachan (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Sambar (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Sambar populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that outmigration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai. Most of the remaining forest within its Chinese range are already established as nature reserves (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Sambar population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Sambar presence through its historical range, to preserve Sambar genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/><p>The most important conservation measure for Sambar in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, and in Thailand it is to to expand government-funded park protection and ranger training programmes outside of the few parks which are currently well supported in the Western Forest Complex. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Sambar conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Nam Et–Phou Louey, and Nakai–Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species, but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Sambar conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Sambar as the focus for efforts.<br/> <br/> Captive breeding is being developed in East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). A captive herd of 223 heads in 10 ha enclosure was established in 1998 in Penajam District, as a pilot project. Several private herds exist in the province, such as at Bearau and at Nunukan, both with more than 20 heads (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Captive Sambar herds are also widespread in mainland Asia.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It is also common in its native range in East Asian countries. Although subject to some possible localized declines, there is no evidence to suggest that the species is at any risk of extinction, and is listed as Least Concern.","Two features are typical of the habitat of Raccoon Dogs: 1) they are often found near water; and 2) during autumn they are more or less dependent on fruits and berries, which affect their habitat selection. In Japan, their habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to subalpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitat and uses less <em>Cryptomeria</em> plantation throughout year, while riparian areas are often used (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b). In urban areas, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover (Yamamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the Russian Far East, the Raccoon Dog favours open landscape, especially damp meadows and agricultural land and avoids dark forests (Judin 1977). <br/><br/>In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favour moist meadows and other habitats with abundant undergrowth, mixed forests and shores of rivers and lakes, especially in early summer (Korneev 1954, Nasimovic and Isakov 1985, Kauhala 1996). In late summer and autumn, they favour moist heaths with abundant berries (Morozov 1947, Kauhala 1996). However, in the Finnish archipelago, they live in barren pine forests where they feed on crowberries (<em>Empetrum nigrum</em>) (Kauhala and Auniola 2000).&#160;In Finland, generally the best landscape for Raccoon Dogs is a landscape with abundant undergrowth, a mosaic of moist forests, damp meadows, gardens and agricultural area (Kauhala and Auttila 2010, Kauhala <em>et al</em>. 2010). The population is sparse in large coniferous forests.","Raccoon Dogs are still persecuted across much of their native range as a pest species. They also may be affected locally by predation from feral dogs, road kills, and from epidemics (including scabies and canine distemper virus), and in some cases may be declining due to extreme habitat loss. The Raccoon Dog is an important vector and victim of rabies in Europe, with increasing significance towards the east and north.","Outside of Japan, where the species is common, there is no information on abundance in their native range. Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted that in China they probably still exist in the wild in parts of Guangxi and Guangdong, but are otherwise likely to be threatened. Population estimates have never been&#160;conducted in Japan, but indirect indices (e.g., road-kills per km of the National Express-ways and harvest&#160;density per prefecture), suggest that relative abundance is high in south-western parts of Japan (i.e., Kyushu, Shikoku, and Chugoku) and low in Hokkaido, Chubu, and extremely urban areas (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b; and see&#160;Table 5.4.2 therein). In Viet Nam, the southerly extent of their range, there is very little information available on their status. A survey undertaken in 2004 in five areas in Na Hang District, Tuyen Quang Province, recorded two captive young animals in Na Vang village after apparently having been taken from a small cave (presumably a den) in Lung Nhoi area (Le Trong Trai <em>et al</em>. 2004), but there is otherwise no other recent information.<br/><br/>The species is common in the introduced range; for example, in Finland the adult population consists of 110,000-120,000 individuals (hunting bag 160,000-170,000 individuals each year). The autumn population, including the young of the year would be about 320,000.",Stable,"The native range of this species extends from northern Indochina (ranging as far south as north-eastern Viet Nam, east of the Red River, and southern Yunnan province in China) through the eastern provinces of China and the Korean Peninsula to the south-east corner of Russia and Mongolia. In the Japanese Archipelago, the species is present throughout Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Awaji island, Sado island and other islets of Japan except those south of Kyushu (e.g., Okinawa islands, Nansei islands, Miyako islands and Ogasawara islands). Introduced to Yakushima island (S. Azuma, in Kauhala and Saeki 2004b).&#160;Absent from Hainan and Taiwan, Province of China.&#160;<br/><br/>The species was introduced in the early to mid-part of the 20th Century to European parts of the former Soviet Union and since then the species has become widespread in northern and eastern Europe, thriving in a landscape which is a mosaic of moist forests with abundant undergrowth, damp meadows and gardens (Kauhala<em> et al</em>. 2010). The northern limit of distribution lies in areas where the mean temperature of the year is just above 0°C, the snow cover &lt;800 mm, the duration of the snow cover &lt;175 days and the length of the growing season &gt;135 days (for example, in Finland the northern limit of permanent distribution is between 65°N and the Arctic Circle). In recent years, when winters have become milder, the Raccoon Dog has expanded its range northwards (in Finland, up to 67°N). Raccoon Dogs appear to have been expanding their range in recent times, including a record in 2002 from the central part of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (at the time the southernmost point of its European range; Ćirović 2006) and a road-kill in south-eastern Spain in 2008 (Kauhala and&#160;Kowalczyk 2011). The latter authors provide a detailed review of the history of colonization of the Raccoon Dog in Europe.","The Russians introduced Raccoon Dogs into the wild in the European part of the former Soviet Union because they wanted to establish a valuable new fur animal in the wild. Raccoon Dog furs continue to be commercially sold, although today they are produced in fur farms. While the species is still commonly farmed for fur in Finland (albeit less intensively than 20-30 years ago), Raccoon Dogs are no longer farmed in Sweden or Hungary, where the last fur farm was closed in 1995. In Japan, Raccoon Dog fur is also used in the production of calligraphic brushes, stuffed animals, and other products. Today, Raccoon Dogs are mainly hunted because they are considered pests.&#160;In Japan, legal culling increased from the 1970s to 15,176 animals in 2012. However, the numbers harvested has declined from a peak of 76,000 in 1981. In China, about 15 million Raccoon Dogs were held by fur farmers in 2010, and China is the largest producer and exporter of Raccoon Dog fur in the world (Petry and Liting 2010). In Finland, the yearly hunting bag for 2013 was about 160,000 animals (Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute 2014). In Poland, where Raccoon Dogs are hunted from August to March, the annual bag was 450–600 in the early 1990s, but more than 11,000 are now hunted annually (Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011). In Germany, 30,000 Raccoon Dogs were hunted in the hunting season of 2008/2009 (Anon., in Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In many countries in the introduced part of their range, where the Raccoon Dog is legally hunted, hunting is permitted year round (e.g., Sweden, Hungary). However, in Finland, females with pups are protected in May, June and July, and in Belarus hunting is allowed from 1 October to the end of February. In Japan, hunting/trapping of the species requires a licence or other form of permission and can only occur within the designated hunting season (November 15 to February 15). The Raccoon Dog on Mukojima island (18.4 km²), Hiroshima prefecture, is designated as a natural monument under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, and permission from the Director-General of the Agency of Cultural Affairs is required for capturing the animals on the island.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Raccoon Dogs occur in national parks and other wildlife protection areas in Japan, where hunting and some other activities are prohibited.

Currently, the population is estimated to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals, and is thought likely to experience a continuing decline nearing 10% over the 10-12 years (three generations) largely as a result of ongoing habitat loss and degradation combined with persecution, and it is here provisionally listed as Near Threatened, based on approximating listing as threatened under criterion C1.","The Sechuran Fox occupies habitats ranging from sandy deserts with low plant density to agricultural lands and dry forests (Cabrera 1931, Huey 1969, Langguth 1975).&#160;The species is often observed in rural areas and disturbed environments from Piura department to La Libertad department in Peru.&#160;Occurs from sea-level to above 1,000 m, and perhaps as much as 2,000 m (Cossios 2009). It is an opportunistic omnivore, capable of being strictly vegetarian when necessary, and likely can survive with limited access to water (Cossios 2009).","The most important threats to this species are from the market for handicrafts and amulets and from persecution because of damage to livestock. In Peru, the typical attitude towards this species is one of persecution (68.3% of correspondents) or indifference (31.7%). The stated reasons for persecution were due to damage on domestic fowl and guinea pigs (65% of correspondents), the consumption of vegetal or stored goods (13.3%), and the belief of goat predation (10%) (Asa and Cossíos 2004). The Sechuran Fox also faces some pressure in agricultural zones and from urbanization and habitat degradation; indeed, habitat reduction or loss is considered the main threat to this species in Ecuador (Tirira 2001, Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011).","This species was judged by Grimwood (1969) as being abundant at the time and not in need of protection. The Sechuran Fox is uncommon in Ecuador, where it is considered to be in decline (Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011). Asa <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated the total population to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals, but these numbers must be regarded with caution since they are supported by very little empirical data. Surveys based on footprints in Coto de Caza El Angolo in Piura, Peru, recorded an average of 12.6 foxes/km (CDC 1989) and an evaluation in San Pedro de Vice mangroves (Piura) estimated a population of 18-23 individuals in 3,013 ha (Chávez-Villavicencio <em>et al</em>. 2015), giving a population density of 0.6-0.76 individuals per km².",Unknown,"The Sechuran Fox can be found in the coastal zones of north-western Peru and south-western Ecuador, between about 3 and 12°S (Asa and Cossios 2004, Cossios 2009). In Ecuador, it has been observed in Manabi, Santa Elena, Guayas, El Oro, Azuay and Loja provinces (Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Peru, it is distributed on the western slope of the Andes between the frontier with Ecuador and Lima. Specimens that have been recorded further south may be the Chilla&#160;<em>Lycalopex griseus</em> or another species as yet undescribed (E. Vivar pers. comm).","Illegal sale of pups, of amulets made from body parts, and of handicrafts made from fur occurs principally in the markets of Tumbes, Chiclayo, Piura and Lima city in Peru. The most common type of handicraft made with fox parts consists of preserved adult animals in a ""sitting"" position. This activity is limited almost exclusively to the department of Piura. The practice of magic-religious rituals by shamans involving preserved Sechuran Fox specimens or parts is the principal human use of this species in Peru. The specimens are used to attract ""good spirits"" or ""positive energies"" during premonition rituals or to manufacture amulets (called seguros) with different purposes. Some shamans use also the Sechuran Fox's fat for the treatment of bronchial illness and stomach disorders (Asa and Cossíos 2004).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislatio</strong><strong>n</strong><br/>Not included in the CITES Appendices.

In Taiwan, the species has undergone continuous declines of &gt;90% in several of the largest known colonies and estimated losses of &gt;70% of known individuals in the last 30 years and similar patterns are suspected throughout its range.","Habitat use, roost ecology and natural history for the species at global  scale are poorly known. In Taiwan, the species has been known to roost  in foliage of 35 plant species, mainly broad-leaved trees (e.g.  <em>Terminalia catapapa</em>, <em>Dimocarpus longan</em>, <em>Hibiscus tiliaceus</em> and <em>Swietenia  mahagoni</em>) and in buildings during breeding seasons (Chang 2007).  Records are from small secondary forest fragments and settlements in  rice paddy-dominated landscape in the lowland during breeding season. It  has been recorded using nature caves and abandoned tunnels in mountain  area with elevations over 1800 m as hibernacula in India (Chakravarty <em>et al.</em>  pers. comm.) and in Taiwan (Heng-Chia Chang, pers. obs). In Pakistan,  few individuals were captured in a mountainous landscape dominated by  agriculture lands, forest patches and grassland in warm temperate zone  (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Salim 2015). In Taiwan, a well-studied maternity  colony began to form in late March, and number peaked in May when  pregnant females gave birth with one offspring during May to June. The  bats left the maternity roost sites between mid-August and early October  for hibernation sites (Shen and Lee 2000). The species is reported  mainly feeding on small flying insects, including coleopterans,  lepidopterans, dipterans, hemipterans (Yang 1996) and foraging in rice  paddy (Ying-Yi Ho, unpubl. data) and riparian grassland (Joe Chun-Chia  Huang, pers. obs.) in the lowland.","Not much is known about the global threats of the species due to its  general rarity. In Taiwan, the causes responsible for the wide and  dramatic decline of this species are also unclear. However, several  potential threats have been proposed. The continuous loss of arable land  and uses of pesticide may have threatened the species by loss of food  source. Several types of pesticide residue were detected from the faeces  of this species (Heng-Chia Chang and Chia-Jung Tsai 2013). Since the  species is at least partly cave-dwelling during winter hibernation,  hence the disturbance of hibernacula and climate changes can be threats.  Two roadkill incidences of the species reported from Taiwan (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://roadkill.tw/"">https://roadkill.tw/</a>)  indicate it is potentially risked by the expansion of road systems and  increasing vehicle volume within its distribution range. A dead bat  found near wind farm in coastal area in western Taiwan suggests the  development of wind energy farms may threaten this species. Domestic  cats might be another threat as a cat-killed incidence is found in  Taiwan (Heng-Chia Chang, pers. obs). Observations in the field show the  presence of artificial light could suppress its emerging from the roost  (Yang 1996). It also tends to avoid artificial light during foraging in  the night (Joe Chun-Chia Huang and Ying-Yi Ho, pers. obs.) suggesting  light pollution may cause degradation of habitats quality, disturbances  to the roost and interference to the migration movement. As it roosts  among foliage, logging also threaten its populations. This species has  conspicuous colouration, hence it may be used as ornament.","It is a generally rare although widely distributed species from northern South Asia to southeastern China and Taiwan (Csorba <em>et al.</em>  2014). It usually roosts as a few to tens animals, although under  specific circumstances it can be relatively numerous, with up to over a  thousand individuals in a single house roost (Heng-Chia Chang, pers.  com.). In Taiwan, continuous and dramatic declines have been observed at  all its largest known colonies. The three colonies containing &gt;100  individuals all experienced a colony size decrease, from ~120-250 to 20  or less. (Heng-Chia Chang and Ying-Yi Ho, unpub. data). Similar trends  of decline were also widely found in ~70% of other smaller colonies  (Heng-Chia Chang unpub. data).",Decreasing,"The species has a rather wide distribution from Afghanistan to Taiwan.

It occurs also in Nepal  (Mahalaxmi and Dhaulagiri), Pakistan, China (Tibet and Jianxi) and  Taiwan. The species has one record from northern Vietnam (Csorba <em>et al.</em>  2014, Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Salim 2015).

Since the population in Taiwan is  migratory, the connectivity between its breeding habitats and winter  hibernacula sites therefore is critical for this species as well.

97164299,16218,Pardofelis marmorata,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Marbled Cat is listed as Near Threatened although it is close to qualifying as Vulnerable under criteria A and C. The change in status from Vulnerable in the 2008 assessment to Near Threatened must not be taken to reflect an actual increase in population nor a reduction of threats, rather the increasing number of camera trap surveys across Asia have, in recent years, confirmed the presence of previously only suspected populations and in some areas have resulted in a higher than expected number of detections and individuals. Despite this, the Marbled Cat remains little known and, across its range, is recorded relatively infrequently, which has hampered efforts to accurately assess its status, so much so that the assessors could not make a unanimous decision, with some assessors believing that maintaining the status as Vulnerable was more appropriate, we therefore report Near Threatened as the view of the majority. Current data suggest the Marbled Cat is forest dependent but does persist in degraded forest. It is also present over a wide elevation range and in rugged areas – areas in which forest loss is slower than average for the region. Marbled Cats are also threatened by hunting, but currently quantitative data is lacking and we cannot assess the impact this is having on the population. There are no published estimates of population density for the Marbled Cat, however, across its range, density probably varies considerably, but given the large range (currently estimated at roughly 1,500,000 km²) the population density needs to be below one individual per 100 km² to qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), this seems implausible in several areas. In summary, the population is probably slightly too large and declining too slowly (<em>c</em>. 25%) to qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>If future research challenges these key assumptions (presence in rugged terrain, over wide elevations, large geographic range, tolerance to some habitat degradation) or provides evidence of a substantially fragmented population, extremely low population density, heavy hunting pressure, or stronger support of the proposed species split, the status will need revising and it is likely that it would then qualify for Vulnerable, probably under criterion C.","<p>Current data suggest that the Marbled Cat is forest dependent, primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous-evergreen tropical forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and may prefer hill forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The increasing use of camera traps throughout its range is revealing detections from disturbed areas (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mathai <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2010), including recently logged forest (e.g. Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010), but surveys of oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo have not detected marbled cats within the plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Yue <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grassman and Tewes (2002) reported a pair of adult Marbled Cats in a salt lick in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat has never been intensively studied, but Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005) report a preliminary home range estimate of 5.3 km² for an adult female who was radio-collared and tracked for one month in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park. There is no detailed information regarding Marbled Cat diet, but it probably preys primarily on rodents, including squirrels (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and birds.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat appears to be primarily diurnal (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><em>&#160;</em>2013).</p>","<p>  The Marbled Cat is forest dependent and forest loss and degradation is continuing across its range from logging and expansion of human settlements and agriculture, including oil palm plantations. The Marbled Cat is valued for skin, meat and bones, although it is infrequently observed in the wildlife trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, it is possible that illegal killing and trade is underreported compared to other species. Targeted and indiscriminate snaring are prevalent throughout much of the range and likely to pose a significant threat. They have been reported as poultry pests (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006) which also results in retaliatory killing. Records of hunting and skins are known from several areas in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India - Vijaynagar-Gandhigram in Changlang district (A. Datta unpubl. data), West Kameng district (Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006), Pakke Kessang, East Kameng district (Lyngdoh <em>et al.</em> 2011), Ziro valley, Lower Subansiri (Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2013) and from Khonoma in Nagaland (Grewal <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no population density estimates for the Marbled Cat. In most surveys, detection rates tend to be lower for this species than some sympatric felids such as the Asiatic Golden Cat (e.g. Pusparini <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gumal <em>et al</em>. 2014, Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014) and both species of Clouded Leopard, but higher than others such as the Bay Cat (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). However, in some surveys, when individual animals have been identified, a similar number or even a higher number of individual Marbled Cats compared to Clouded Leopards have been found (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). It is therefore possible that low detection rates may under some circumstances arise from cameras placed inappropriately for Marbled Cats, it is also likely that the population density will vary greatly across the range and it is important to note that many surveys have resulted in very few detections. However, unless population densities are very low, or the distribution extremely patchy it is likely that the total population numbers over 10,000 mature individuals, although this is certainly in decline.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marbled Cat is found from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal eastwards into southwest China, southwards throughout mainland Southeast Asia and on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

97165437,4038,Catopuma temminckii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is assessed as Near Threatened. However, there is a general paucity of data for this species, with no density estimates or population data, making an assessment of the true status of the species difficult. The data that we do have indicate that the species has likely experienced population declines of over 20%, and approaching 30% in recent years due to extensive habitat loss and poaching across their range. This pattern is likely to continue in the future, and indicates that the Asiatic Golden Cat is very close to qualifying for a Vulnerable status under criterion A.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat has been documented from twelve countries in Southeast Asia. Yet, despite this fairly wide distribution, its presence in India, Bangladesh and Nepal is limited and patchy (Datta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, with records in both China and Viet Nam declining drastically in recent years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007; Gray <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm.). It has not been recorded in Viet Nam since 2005, and extensive surveys carried out&#160; in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi Provinces of China have recorded Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Beijing Forestry University unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration unpublished data). It is likely to be extirpated from these two countries in the very near future. The Asiatic Golden Cat is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but the is thought to be experiencing population declines in these areas as well (Linkie and Ridout 2009, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015, K. Kawanishi pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm).<br/><br/>The most significant threats to the Asiatic Golden Cat are thought to be habitat loss and poaching. Although the species has occasionally been recorded from degraded or altered habitats, it is primarily a forest dependent species, and thus is threatened by the significant habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed slightly, they are still among the highest in the world at roughly one million hectares/year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO 2011). Land conversion is also a threat to the Asiatic Golden Cat, and even in countries such as Bhutan, where the species is thought to enjoy a relatively protected status, an increase in hyrdopower projects has the potential to negatively impact the species. Poaching of the species is thought to be increasing in many areas, as it is often targeted for the sale of its pelt and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Khan 2008, Aiyadurai <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Pusparini <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm., P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm., S. Mukherjee&#160;pers. comm., T. Gray&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm., A. Datta&#160;pers. comm., D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Increasingly, the species may be targeted as a substitute for Tiger pelts and bones. In Viet Nam, there have been several incidences of confiscated Asiatic Golden Cat pelts that were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). It is also the victim of indiscriminate snaring and hunting in some areas (Holden 2001, Khan 2008, D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Finally, there are indications that the species is increasingly being killed in retribution for preying on livestock (mainly poultry) (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The lack of reliable density estimates severely limit our ability to accurately assess the population status and trend of the species. However, the decrease, or sudden absence, of Asiatic Golden Cat records from many areas, in combination with an apparently increased level of poaching, lead us to believe that the population is declining across its range. More rigorous scientific data for this species is needed, and may provide a strong basis on which to base change in status to Vulnerable.","The Asiatic Golden Cat is primarily found in forested areas, particularly tropical and subtropical moist evergreen forests, mixed evergreen forests, and dry deciduous forests. (Nowell and Jackson 1996, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Two radio collared individuals (a male and a female) in Thailand occurred most often in closed forest habitats (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). However, the species has also been recorded from open areas such as shrub or grasslands, or open rocky areas, and from degraded or fragmented forest landscapes (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013). A radio collared female in Sumatra was frequently recorded outside of a protected area in remnant fragments of forest located between coffee plantations (McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>Records of the Asiatic Golden Cat have a wide altitudinal variation. The species was documented at elevations up to 3,960 m in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve Sikkim, India, at 3,738 m in the Jigme Sigye Wangchuk National Park in Bhutan, at 2,896 m in Trongsa, and at 3,900 m in Wangduephodrang (Wang 2007, Bashir <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, S. Dahal pers. comm.). However, in some areas it appears to be more common in lowland forests. In Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, it was only recorded by camera traps at low elevations.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat is remarkably polymorphic in its pelage. The most common coat color is golden or red brown, but it may also be dark brown or even grey. Melanistic individuals have been reported and may be predominant in some areas of its range (Holden 2001). There is also a spotted form which is called an “ocelot morph” due to its ocelot-like rosettes. To date, this form has been reported from China (in Sichuan and Tibet) and from Bhutan (Wang 2007). The most distinct features of this cat are the white lines bordered with dark brown to black running across the cheeks, from the nostrils towards the cheeks, at the inner corner of the eyes, and up the crown. The rounded ears have black backs with a grey spot. The chest, abdomen and inner side of the upper legs are white with light speckling. The legs and tail are grey to black at the distal ends. The terminal half of the tail is white on the underside and is often carried with the end curled dorsally. Males are larger than females.<br/><br/>Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Asiatic Golden Cat. It was once thought to be primarily nocturnal, however, recent data indicates that it may be more crepuscular or diurnal. Two radio-collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park showed mainly diurnal and crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In addition, most camera trap photographs of Asiatic Golden Cats in the Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks in Sumatra were taken during the day (Holden 2001, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The home ranges of two radio collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park were 33 km² (female) and 48 km² (male) and overlapped in significantly (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>One confirmed scat contained the remains of Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Scats from Sumatra contained rat and muntjac remains, and the stomach contents of a carcass in Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park included the remains of a small snake (Grassman 1998).","As a forest dependent species, the Asiatic Golden Cat is threatened by habitat loss throughout it's range. Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed substantially, they are still among the highest in the world (FAO 2011). An increasing number of hydropower projects in countries such as Bhutan, also have the potential to negatively impact the species. In addition, the species is threatened by increasing levels of illegal hunting and poaching for consumption, and for the sale of pelts and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Khan 2008, H. Rahman pers. comm., P. Riordan pers. comm., S. Mukherjee pers. comm., T. Gray pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm.). There is thought to be some level of poaching or hunting of the species in every country across its range. Pelts have been recorded being traded along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and in Sumatra (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Pusparini <em>et al.</em> 2014), and skins are reported from several sites in northeast India (Aiyadurai <em>et al.</em> 2010, A. Datta pers. comm.). Poaching pressure is particularly high in China and Viet Nam, where the species may soon face extirpation.  In Viet Nam, there is some evidence that the species is increasingly targeted as a substitute for Tiger skins and parts, as Tigers become more difficult to obtain. There have been several incidences of confiscated Golden Cat pelts which were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox pers. comm.). Snaring appears to be on the rise across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and constitutes a major threat to the species D. Willcox pers. comm.). In Bangladesh, several recent specimens indicate that the species is  commonly hunted by indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Conflict with humans due to livestock depredation is also thought to be an issue for the species. Retribution killing of the species in response to chicken depredation was recorded in Sumatra (McCarthy 2013).","A lack of density estimates across the range makes it difficult to accurately assess the true population status of the species. Owing to somewhat similar camera trap encounter rates, the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to have comparable abundances to those of sympatric felids (e.g. <em>Neofelis nebulosa, Neofelis diardi, Pardofelis marmorata</em>). However, some surveys have recorded the Golden Cat more frequently than sympatric felid species, while others have recorded the it less frequently, so their relative abundance likely varies significantly across their range (Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Rao <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Mishra <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Bashir <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In addition, it is important to consider that the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to be mainly terrestrial, which may influence the number of camera trap photos recorded in comparison to more arboreal felid species such as <em>Neofelis diardi</em>, <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>&#160;and <em>Pardofelis marmorata</em>.",Decreasing,"The Asiatic Golden Cat has been recorded rarely and patchily from the Northeastern states of India (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim), through eastern Bangladesh (Northeast and the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and eastern Nepal (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lyngdoh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lalthanpuia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Borah <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Velho 2013, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, and records in Viet Nam and south China have decreased drastically in recent years, with strong indications that the species may face extirpation there in the next several years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan pers. comm.). It is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia (Tempa <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, T. Dhendup&#160;pers. comm., K. Kawanishi&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm.). It is widely reported from the island of Sumatra, but not present on other Indonesian islands (Ridout and&#160;Linkie 2009, Sunarto 2011, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>This distribution may be somewhat generous, particularly in China and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam there have been several Asiatic Golden Cat pelts confiscated recently in local markets, however, they are of undetermined origin. A live individual has not been recorded in the country since 2005, despite numerous camera trap studies. It is likely that the species has been extirpated from most of the country due to widespread and indiscriminate snaring. In China, extensive surveys carried out with local protected area and provincial government teams in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces have recorded the Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data). It is likely that the species is, or will soon be, extirpated from large areas of its range in south China as well.",,Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is listed under Appendix I of CITES (as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Catopuma temminckii</span>), and is officially protected over most of its range by national legislation.

97212355,11509,Leopardus pardalis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Ocelot has a wide distribution, from northern Argentina to the southwestern United States, being the most common felid species in most of the tropical and subtropical habitats of the Neotropics; it is listed as Least Concern. Densities seem to increase with rainfall and decrease with latitude, with the highest densities in tropical areas (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2008). Even though there are indications of specific population declines, these do not seem to affect the species to the point of categorizing it under any threat category rangewide. Its extensive occurrence in Brazil, added to the remaining area of present distribution allows an effective population of &gt;40,000 mature individuals (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). At least in some areas of the Amazon basin, populations are apparently healthy and stable. The species is, nevertheless, impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, intense logging activities, vehicle collisions and poaching (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2008, Payan <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia, Ocelots manage to survive in oil palm landscapes and extensive cattle ranches in the llanos and Inter-Andean valleys (Boron and Payan 2013, Diaz-Pulido and Payan 2011). In Argentina, the species still is found in all the subtropical area and although it is affected by poaching and logging (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, 2008, 2010), a total of 1,500 to 8,000 individuals is estimated for this country at the southern range of the species (Aprile <em>et al.</em> 2012). Populations of northeastern Mexico and Texas have experienced dramatic declines and the genetic impacts of isolation are apparent, particularly in Texas (Janecka <em>et al.</em> 2011 and Janecka <em>et al.</em> 2014). The number of Ocelots in Texas is believed to be between 50 – 80 individuals. These areas will certainly need attention or Ocelots are likely to be extirpated there.","The species occupies a wide spectrum of habitats types, ranging from scrublands to tropical rain forests. What all these habitats have in common is a well-structured vegetation cover (Emmons 1988, Emmons <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Ocelots were recorded in mangrove forests, coastal marshes, savanna grasslands, thorn scrubs, and tropical and subtropical forest (primary, secondary, evergreen, seasonal and montane). The species typically occurs at elevations below 3,000 m but there are occasional reports of the species up to 3,000 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>The Ocelot is a medium sized felid (11 kg), with a litter size of 1.4 kittens (1–4), and typically nocturno-crepuscular activity, but that could also be active during daytime (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Di Bitetti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Throughout much of its range tends to be the most abundant cat species. The Ocelot also reaches higher density estimates than its sympatric smaller species and was suggested that also negatively impact its small guild members (Di Bitetti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). The species use similar habitat and show similar abundance patterns than Jaguars and Pumas and appear not to be affected by these species (Di Bitetti et al 2010, Davis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011)&#160; Its diet includes small mammals, birds and reptiles, but include also larger sized prey (&gt;800 g), such as agoutis, armadillos, pacas, monkeys, etc. that in some areas can constitute the most important items (Crawshaw 1995, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Moreno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Bianchi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010)<br/><br/>The home ranges of males are larger than the ranges of the sympatric females, but high variation exist on the size between regions (Dillon and Kelly 2008).&#160; The largest home ranges (43 km² for males and 16 km² for females) were observed in Subtropical forest of Brazil and Argentina (Crawshaw 1995) and the smallest (2 to 6 km² for males and 1 to 3 km² for females) were observed in Texas (US), Brazilian Pantanal, Peruvian Amazonia and Bolivian Chaco (Navarro 1985, Emmons 1988, Crawshaw and Quigley 1989, Laack 1991, Maffei and Noss 2008).","At present the major threats for the species are habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry and illegal trade of pets and pelts (Sunquist and Sunquiest 2002).The Ocelot has been described as being tolerant in some degree to habitat disturbs and persists in wooded patches near human settlements. However, Ocelot abundance is negatively affected by anthropogenic effects like poaching and logging (Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Although widespread commercial harvests for the fur trade ceased decades ago, some illegal trade still persists.","Ocelot population densities throughout its entire range varies widely from 2.5 to 160/100 km². At a continental scale, Ocelot densities decrease with latitude and increase with rainfall (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Primary productivity seems to determine the abundance of this wild cat across their range, but at a local scale their abundance may be affected by logging and poaching or by competition with other species (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). The lowest densities are found at the Pine Forest of Belize (Dillon and Kelly 2007), dry areas of Mexico (Gonzalez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003) and the Caatinga in northeastern Brazil (Oliveira 2012). The maximum estimated density was found at the Barro Colorado Island in Panamá (Rodgers <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The species is considered Endangered in Mexico (Norma Oficial Mexicana 2010) and in United States (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2010), Vulnerable in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) and Argentina (Aprile <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).

Although thought to exist at relatively low population densities, the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;appears to be adaptable, and is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. Despite the species’ apparent habitat plasticity, the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;is forest dependent, and does not readily use oil palm <em>Elaeis guineensis</em> plantations (Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), although such plantations may not necessarily form a hard barrier to this wild cat (Nájera <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data). The forests of Borneo and Sumatra are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, coupled with the species’ apparent low population size, probably constitute the greatest threat to this species.<br/><br/>Population density estimates of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;on Borneo, derived from targeted camera trap surveys across a range of forest types and elevations, and a gradient of disturbance, range from 0.8 to 4.4 individuals / 100 km² (Brodie and Giordano 2012, Wilting <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Loken <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep), a large proportion of which (6 of 10 surveys) provide estimates of under 1.9 individuals / 100 km². Additional camera trap surveys on Borneo, specifically undertaken to detect and estimate the density of this felid, failed to find any evidence of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard, including the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and several forest sites in Kalimantan (Cheyne <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep), indicating that Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;presence across the forested landscape of Borneo is somewhat patchy. The population density of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;on Sumatra is less well studied, but four camera surveys undertaken within the Kerinci landscape present a similar pattern to that of Borneo, with densities ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 individuals / 100 km² (Sollmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>A Maximum Entropy based habitat suitability analysis, using presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and land use covariates, estimated that the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s current area of occupancy (AOO) on Borneo is approximately 378,900 km² (Borneo Carnivore Symposium: Hearn <em>et al.</em> in prep). Such habitat suitability data are lacking for Sumatra. For this assessment, an approximate AOO for Sumatra was developed from a map of forest cover derived from satellite images taken in 2010 (Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Land cover classes identified as suitable habitat by expert opinion during the Bornean Carnivore Symposium in 2011 (Peat-swamp forest, Lowland Forest and lower montane forest &lt;1500 m) were selected and included in the AOO, which amounted to approximately 73,000 km², providing a total AOO of 451,900 km². As detailed below, forest cover on both Borneo and Sumatra will have decreased since 2010. Furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient data, these estimates are unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range, which could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO. Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure and a patchy distribution, and further loss of forest post 2010, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;across its AOO may be as low as 1 individual / 100 km². Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals could be around 4,500 individuals, and is thus very likely to be below 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/>A GIS exercise as part of the current assessment used the habitat suitability assessment alongside land cover data for Borneo for 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and the selected land cover classes for Sumatra for the years 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and estimated that the AOO decreased by 33.1% during this time period, primarily as a result of forest loss and conversion to oil palm plantations. Given the strong evidence for forest dependency in this felid, this loss of AOO, coupled with hunting pressure, is probably driving a reduction in the number of mature individuals at the same rate or higher. More recent satellite imagery shows that forest loss has continued to reduce the AOO (Gaveau <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Macdonald <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep a), and it is likely that forest loss continues to this day, albeit at a reduced rate. Although the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;probably spends a proportion of its time hunting, moving and resting in the trees, because much of its time is also spent moving on the ground, Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;are prone to untargeted snaring.<br/><br/>We therefore have a strong basis upon which to infer that the total Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;population size currently lies below 10,000 individuals, and that the cumulative reduction in the AOO and thus population size as a consequence of forest loss, degradation and poaching has probably amounted to ≥30% in the past 21 years (three Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;generations, Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013) indicating a categorisation of Vulnerable under both VU C1 and VU A2c.","The Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;appears to be a relatively adaptable species, and is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. Recent camera trap surveys have recorded the felid in primary lowland, upland and submontane Dipterocarp forest (Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Brodie and Giordano 2012, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Loken <em>et al.</em> unpubl data, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), selectively logged Dipterocarp forest (Ross<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Wilting <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Mathai <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Loken <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpublished data), and peat-swamp forest (Cheyne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, 2013). Although the species is able to persist in modified habitats, the effects of anthropogenic disturbance remain unclear. Brodie <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2015) estimated the local abundance of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;through hierarchical modelling of camera-trap data with biophysical and anthropogenic covariates and found that an increased road density was associated with reduced local abundance of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards. Their study also showed that local abundance increased linearly as elevation increased, although they highlight that the effect was slight. Similar responses were shown by McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2015), who applied a Maximum entropy approach to model habitat use of the Sunda Clouded Leopard&#160;in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and reported the species appeared to be relatively intolerant of anthropogenic features, occurring most commonly at moderate distances from roads, rivers and forest edges, all features which assist the movement of people. McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2015) also found a positive association with moderate elevation forest. Although there is much to learn about the response of the Sunda Clouded Leopard&#160;to habitat modification, the available evidence strongly supports the notion that this felid is forest dependent, and does not readily use oil palm <em>Elaeis guineensis</em> plantations (Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Yue <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), although such plantations may not necessarily form a hard barrier to this wild cat (Nájera <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Sumatra, the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;was hypothesized to exist at much lower population densities than on Borneo, potentially in response to predation and/or interspecific competition from tigers. The few density estimates that have been recorded from Sumatra (Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014) to date, however, lie within the range of estimates for Borneo (Brodie and Giordano 2012, Wilting <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Cheyne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Further data are thus needed to investigate whether interspecific competition is influencing densities of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. <br/><br/>Little is known regarding the spatial ecology of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. A female Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard, residing in a selectively logged forest in Sabah, occupied a home-range of 16.1 km² and a core-range of 5.4 km² (95% and 50% fixed kernel estimators, respectively) (Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The data only spanned a 109 day period, however, yet they represent the only available published data on the movements of this species. Clouded Leopards (<em>Neofelis </em>spp.) possess morphological adaptions that enable them to climb and move swiftly in the forest canopy, and there are numerous incidental records of such behaviour in the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;on Borneo (eg. Davis 1962, Matsuda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Morino 2010). Track surveys (Holden 2001, Gordon and Stewart 2007) and camera trap records (Ridout and Linkie 2009, Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Brodie and Giordano 2012, Wilting <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Cheyne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Pusparini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) highlight that terrestrial activity is commonplace, particularly along trails and logging roads. Rabinowitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1987) proposed that&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;may be less arboreal on Borneo due to the absence of sympatric tigers. Movement data from tagged animals in Sabah show speeds which are indicative of a predominantly terrestrial activity pattern (Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpublished data). <br/><br/>No studies as yet have quantitatively investigated the diet of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. Observations of predation events, however, suggest that the species feeds on a wide range of small to medium sized mammalian prey, including Sambar Deer <em>Rusa unicolor</em>, Muntjacs <em>Muntiacus </em>spp., Bearded Pig <em>Sus barbatus</em>, Mouse Deer <em>Tragulus </em>spp., porcupines and primates, and it is likely that the diet of this felid varies considerably across its range (Davis 1962, Rabinowitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1987, Yeager 1991, Gordon and Stewart 2007, Matsuda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Morino 2010). Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2013) used camera trap data to show that Bearded Pigs exhibited greater nocturnal activity in the absence of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopardc, with female pigs and young showing the strongest response. The study suggests that Bearded Pigs, and particularly young animals, may be a key prey species and are capable of altering their activity pattern in response to this predation risk.<br/><br/>Analyses of camera trap photographs from both Borneo (Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and Sumatra (Ridout and Linkie 2009, Pusparini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) suggest the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s temporal activity is largely nocturnal, with significant activity being shown during crepuscular periods, and this pattern is supported by activity data from radio-collared animals in Sabah (Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpublished data). Such sources provide several instances of diurnal activity, however, and there are incidental records of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;hunting primates during the day (Davis 1962, Matsuda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Morino 2010).","Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations and the increasing threat from poaching pose the greatest threats to the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020 (Rautner&#160;2005). A more recent analysis of deforestation risk predicts that by 2020 37% of the remaining forest in Borneo will have a greater than 25% risk of being deforested and that approximately 13% of Borneo’s forests (an area of 11,167 km²) will have a greater than 50% chance of being lost (Macdonald <em>et al.</em>&#160;in prep. a). This deforestation will not only reduce the area of available habitat for the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;but it is also likely to increase the fragmentation of its populations. In a modelling analysis of the likely impacts of this deforestation, Macdonald <em>et al.</em> (in prep. b) predict that between 2010 and 2020 the percentage of the landscape connected by dispersal in Borneo will decrease by over 60% and that this could lead to both a large reduction in the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;numbers and also a significant reduction in the potential gene flow between populations. Increased fragmentation of Clouded Leopard&#160;habitat may also be resulting in an increased risk of disease in some populations due to exposure to pathogens present in feral cat and dog populations. One study in Sabah found seropositive findings for canine parvovirus and/or distemper virus in feral cats and dogs, Malay Civets (<em>Viverra tangalunga</em>) and Common Palm Civets (<em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em>) living sympatrically with Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;(Nájera <em>et al.</em> in prep).<br/><br/>Poaching, either directly through the use of snares, or through the reduction of prey availability by the poaching of game species, poses a significant threat, both in Sumatra (Holden <em>et al.</em> 2001) and Borneo (Rabinowitz <em>et al.</em> 1987, Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2006, Cheyne <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Our understanding of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s population density on Borneo, and particularly in the Malaysian state of Sabah, has improved in recent years, with the advent of intensive, targeted camera traps surveys, analysed within a capture-recapture framework. Population density estimates from a range of forest types and elevations, and a gradient of disturbance are typically low (0.8 – 4.4 ind. / 100 km², with 6 of 10 surveys providing estimates of under 1.9 ind. / 100 km². All estimates from Sabah were derived using a spatially explicit capture recapture framework (SECR), from primary Dipterocarp forest, including lowland (Maliau Basin Conservation Area, 1.9 ind. / 100 km²: Brodie and Giordano 2012, Danum Valley Conservation Area, 1.76 ind. / 100 km²: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), upland (Tawau Hills National Park, 1.85 ind. / 100 km²: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and submontane/montane (Crocker Range National Park, 1.4 ind. / 100 km²: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), population density estimates from selectively logged forests are more variable (Tangkulap-Pinangah Forest Reserve, 0.84 ind. / 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Segaliud Lokan Forest Reserve, 1.0 ind. / 100 km²: Wilting <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Ulu Segama Forest Reserve, 2.55 ind. / 100 km², Tabin Wildlife Reserve, 2.26 ind. / 100 km² (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). In Kalimantan, there are only two studies that have yielded population density estimates of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. Loken pers. comm.&#160;used SECR and provide estimates from the selectively logged Wehea Forest in East Kalimantan (1.23 to 3.01 ind. / 100 km²). Using a conventional capture recapture framework, which typically results in higher densities from that derived using SECR, Cheyne <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) provide density estimates for a population of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;residing within the Sabangau peat swamp, a disturbed peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan (0.7-4.4 ind. / 100 km²). Additional Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;focused surveys on Borneo failed to find any evidence of this species, including the relatively small (ca. 43 km²) and isolated Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and several forest sites in Kalimantan (Cheyne <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in prep). Such surveys highlight the potential patchy nature of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;presence across the forested landscape of Borneo. The population density of this felid on Sumatra has received less attention, but surveys are currently underway (I. Haidir pers comm, 2015), and four camera surveys undertaken within the Kerinci landscape present a similar pattern to that of Borneo, with densities ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 individuals / 100 km² (Sollmann <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>A Maximum Entropy based habitat suitability analysis for Borneo, discussed in detail above, provided a total AOO of 451,900 km² (Borneo: 378,900 km², Sumatra: 73,000 km²). Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure, a potentially patchy distribution, and further loss of forest post-2010, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;across its AOO may plausibly be as low as 1 individual / 100 km². Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals range-wide could be around 4,500 individuals, with around 3,800 persisting in Borneo and as few as 730 individuals remaining in Sumatra.",Decreasing,"The Sunda Clouded Leopard is found on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo (Buckley-Beason <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Kitchener <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, 2007; Christiansen <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008;&#160;Christiansen&#160;2009; Wilting <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007,&#160;2011). It is unknown if there are still Sunda Clouded Leopards on the small Batu Islands close to Sumatra. There are Clouded Leopard fossils from Java (Meijaard 2004), but no records of living animals from modern times. A Maximum Entropy habitat suitability model for Sunda Clouded Leopards on Borneo, derived from presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and land use covariates (Borneo Carnivore Symposium: Hearn <em>et al.</em> in prep), was used to develop an estimate of this species’ current area of occupancy (AOO) on Borneo, and provided an estimate of approximately 378,900 km². Data regarding Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;habitat suitability are currently unavailable for Sumatra, however, and so as part of this assessment, an approximate AOO for Sumatra was developed by quantifying areas of suitable habitat from a land cover map derived from satellite images taken in 2010 (Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012), based on land cover classes identified as suitable habitat by expert opinion during the Bornean Carnivore Symposium in 2011. The analysis provided an approximate AOO for Sumatra of 73,000 km², and thus a range-wide total AOO of 451,900 km². As detailed below, forest cover on both Borneo and Sumatra will have decreased since 2010. Furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient data, these estimates are unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range, which could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO.<br/><br/>The habitat suitability analysis for Borneo suggest that this felid has a widespread distribution over a large contiguous forested portion of Borneo, with the only exception being South Kalimantan, which was predicted as being largely composed of non-habitat. The distribution map presented as part of this assessment is largely based on this habitat suitability exercise, but small patches which were identified as non-habitat in the model output have been included here as habitat. In addition, the Tabin Wildlife Reserve, not included in the original model output, has been included here, based on recorded presence (Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012).",See Threats section.,Terrestrial,"The Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;is currently listed under CITES Appendix I (as <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>), and warrants full listing under <em>N. diardi</em>.

It occurs in most protected areas along the Sumatran mountain spine, and in most of the larger protected areas on Borneo, though maintaining or re-establishing connectivity among protected areas (e.g. via habitat corridors) remains a critical conservation priority for the species. The Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;has been the subject of increased research in recent years, but it remains one of the least studied of the world’s Pantherine felids, hampering the development of conservation actions. It is essential, therefore, to gain an understanding of this species’ distribution, abundance, and responses to anthropogenic modification, particularly in Sumatra, and also in Kalimantan, Sarawak and Brunei. Data on the distribution and abundance of this species in Sabah has improved greatly in recent years, and it remains essential to monitor the population over time.

Some range countries have maintained status quo Clouded Leopard abundance, however, the majority of range countries have experienced moderate declines, with serious declines noted for Myanmar, Viet Nam and China. The causes of Clouded Leopard declines are attributed primarily to (1) direct exploitation, (2) range fragmentation, and (3) reduction in habitat quality. Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts is well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Ongoing deforestation in countries such as Myanmar and Cambodia is also leading to increased fragmentation and reduction of optimal habitat for Clouded Leopard.<br/><br/>A reduction of at least 30% in the number of mature individuals over the last three generations (GL of 7 years [Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013] x 3 = 21 years, 1993–2014) is suspected due to direct exploitation and habitat loss. The pattern of decline is not well understood given a lack of data on sub-population sizes and trend, and the rate of decline has probably varied. In a small part of the range we assume Clouded Leopard numbers to be roughly stable: Bhutan, Malaysia and Thailand, comprising roughly 12% of 2007 EOO and an assumed 12% of the 1993 population). We find it plausible that numbers in the remainder of its range declined at a mean annual rate of at least 1.63%, resulting in a minimum population reduction of 30% (a zero % decline in 12% of the population and a nearly 35% decline in the remaining 88%). As these threats are viewed as unlikely to cease and in some cases may not be reversible, an equivalent future decline is also suspected (a minimum future reduction in the number of mature individuals of 30% from 2015–2036). <br/><br/>We take a precautionary attitude toward uncertainty in this assessment. We are certain of relatively steep declines due to habitat loss and direct exploitation, however, the rate is not known and we assume a threshold rate that meets the A criterion for Vulnerable. Generation length could be lower: for example Yamada and Durrant (1989) reported that few Clouded Leopards in captivity were reproductively successful after five (F) or six (M) years of age, but we suspect these are dated observations given improvements in captive breeding. Also, generation length may be shortened in declining wild populations if mortality results in reduced longevity. If a shorter GL is used, and if we did not change our assumptions about the rate of decline, the suspected reduction would be less than 30% thus qualifying the species as Near Threatened. However, because we are even more uncertain about the total number of mature individuals than we are about the likelihood of decline, it is possible that they could number less than 10,000, and the species could also qualify as Vulnerable under C1.","The Clouded Leopard is intermediate in size between large and small cats, with wild females from Thailand weighing 11.5 (Austin and Tewes 1999) to 13.5 kg (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005), and males 16 (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005) to 18 kg (Austin and Tewes 1999).  Its coat is patterned with distinctive large cloud shaped markings, its canines are exceptionally elongated, as is its tail - for a large cat, the Clouded Leopard is highly arboreal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  They are strongly associated with forest habitat, particularly primary evergreen tropical rainforest, but there are also records from dry and deciduous forest, as well as secondary and logged forests. They have been recorded in the Himalayas up to 2,500 m and possibly as high as 3,000 m.  Less frequently, they have been found in grassland and scrub, dry tropical forests and mangrove swamps (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Radio-tracking studies in Thailand have showed a preference for forest over more open habitats (Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>A study in Thailand's Phu Khieo&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary&#160;found that Clouded Leopards preyed upon a variety of arboreal and terrestrial prey, including Hog Deer, Slow Loris, Bush-tailed Porcupine, Malayan Pangolin and Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).  Other observations include mainly primate prey, but also Muntjac and Argus Pheasant (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Clouded Leopards are primarily nocturnal, with crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Two radio-telemetry studies in different parks in Thailand found that adult male and female Clouded Leopards had similar home range sizes between 30-40 km² in size (95% fixed kernel estimators), with smaller intensively used core areas of 3-5 km² (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).  While both studies found substantial home range overlap between males and females, as is typical of most felids, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005) also found that the ranges of their two radio-collared males overlapped by a significant amount (39%).  Although both studies found similar home ranges, clouded leopards in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary travelled approximately twice the average daily distance (average 2 km) than Clouded Leopards in Khao Yai National Park (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Clouded Leopards may occur at higher densities when densities of the larger cats, Tigers and Leopards, are lower (Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Rao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","Clouded Leopards prefer closed forest (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and their habitat in Southeast Asia is undergoing the world's fastest deforestation rate (1.2-1.3% a year since 1990: FAO 2007).<br/><br/>The Clouded Leopard is hunted for the illegal wildlife trade&#160;–&#160;large numbers of skins have been seen in market surveys, and there is also trade in bones for medicines, meat for exotic dishes and live animals for the pet trade (Hunter 2011). Wild animals are likely to be the primary source, but there is also some illegal trade from captive animals (Nowell 2007). Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts are well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Data from Tachilek on the Myanmar–Thailand border (19 surveys, 1991–2013) and Mong La on the Myanmar–China border (seven surveys, 2001–2014) show that the most common species in trade was the Clouded Leopard <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em> (482 individuals, observed in 22/24 surveys. However, the trade of cat parts from Myanmar into Thailand has diminished and reaffirms the role of China in the trade of cats out of Myanmar (Nijman and Shepherd 2015).","The Clouded Leopard is most strongly associated with primary tropical forest which is rapidly disappearing across its range (Hunter 2011, Nowell and Jackson 1996), and Clouded Leopard skins have been observed in large numbers in illegal wildlife trade in Southeast Asia (Nowell 2007).

Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey <em>et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014). In Brazil it is considered Near Threatened but subspecies outside the Amazon basic are considered Vulnerable (Machado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).

101138963,12518,Lynx canadensis,Least Concern,,2016,2014-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<strong>This is an amended version of the original assessment that was published in 2014, with some corrections to the distribution map included. </strong><br/><br/>The Canada lynx (<em>Lynx canadensis</em>) is listed as Least Concern because over most of its range it is widespread and abundant, it has been legally harvested for the international fur trade for more than 200 hundred years, and recent decades of managed harvests do not appear to have caused any significant population decline or range loss (Mowat <em>et al.</em> 2000). In the southern part of its range, lynx are less abundant and as a result are protected from harvest. In New Brunswick, lynx are listed as “Endangered” under the New Brunswick Species at Risk Act, in Nova Scotia as ""Endangered"" under Nova Scotia's Endangered Species Act (Nova Scotia Lynx Recovery Team 2006), and in 14 contiguous United States as ""Threatened"" under the US Endangered Species Act due to inadequate protection of habitat on Federal lands (USFWS 2000). Although a federal recovery plan for lynx in the US has not been started, since listed as Threatened, lynx in the northeast US have been increasing (Vashon <em>et al.</em> 2012) and only one state with a resident breeding population has documented significant declines in lynx numbers (Koehler <em>et al.</em> 2008). Lynx in the contiguous US may require connectivity with northern populations for persistence (McKelvey <em>et al.</em> 2000, Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003, Squires <em>et al.</em> 2013). The US Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) decision to designate 39,000 acres of critical habitat in portions of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Washington and Wyoming (USFWS 2009) has been challenged and remanded to the USFWS (Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013).","Canada Lynx are found primarily in boreal forests, and their main prey species, the Snowshoe Hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>), depends largely on patches of successional growth (Buskirk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) in older multi-layered stands (Ruediger <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Koehler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Squires <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008) or younger regenerating stands following disturbance (Burdett 2008, Vashon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Walpole <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Hares make up 60-97% of the lynx diet, with an average consumption rate of one hare every 1-2 days (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The lynx-hare cycle was first observed in harvest records of the Hudson’s Bay Company dating back to the early 1800s. Numbers of Snowshoe Hares peak approximately every ten years in the northern part of their range, and lynx numbers follow the same pattern with a short lag, typically 1-2 years. The fluctuations can be drastic, with hare abundance reaching 2,300/km² during the peaks, and crashing to 12/km² during the lows. While the populations of many prey and predator species are cyclic and roughly synchronous in the northern latitudes, the hare-lynx correlation is particularly close (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Three primary variables are suggested to drive the cycle: predation, herbivory, and food-plant availability (Krebs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Historically, lynx trapping pressure also influenced the amplitude of the cycle (Gamarra and Sole 2000). Since predator and prey communities are more diverse in the southern part of the lynx range, the importance of Snowshoe Hares in the diet of southern lynx populations has been questioned (Buskirk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). However, recent studies have shown that lynx in southern areas prey almost exclusively on Snowshoe Hare (Hanson and Moen 2008, Maletzke <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Fuller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Squires and Ruggiero 2007). Ungulates do not usually figure prominently in the lynx's diet, other than as carrion, although lynx preyed on Caribou calves in Newfoundland after the hare population crashed (Bergerud 1983). Lynx home ranges average 15-50 km² and tend to be larger on the southern periphery of their geographic distribution, suggesting that these areas contain are marginal habitat. Average lynx densities range from 1-45 animals (including young) per 100 km², and fluctuate with hare abundance (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). However, in an area in Maine where dense young stands of softwood were common, lynx home ranges were averaged 25 km² for adult females and 50 km² for adult males (Vashon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008).","In most of Canada and Alaska, trapping of lynx for the fur trade is managed through regulated seasons. Trapping can reduce lynx populations and can have the greatest impact when hare populations cyclically crash. In the 1980s, in response to concerns about over-harvest during the cyclic low of the lynx-hare cycle, Alaska and most Canadian provinces modifying seasons or bag limits to match harvest with lynx population levels and trends (Golden 1999, Mowat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). In the early 1980s (1980-1984), an average of 35,669 Canada Lynx pelts were exported from the US and Canada during the cyclic high. By the late 1980s (1986-1989) the annual export of lynx averaged 7,360 pelts during the cyclic low. Exports have trended lower and fluctuated less severely since then, with annual exports from 2000-2006 averaging 15,387 pelts (UNEP-WCMC 2008). Historical information suggests that, despite minimal harvest controls for much of the last century, lynx-hare cycles have been largely stable in the northern part of their range and no permanent range decrease has been detected (Mowat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Poole 2003).<br/><br/>In eastern Canada where lynx are protected, the primary threat is believed to be from interspecific competition from the eastern coyote, which expanded its range into eastern North America in the last few decades (Parker 2001). In southern Alberta, road density and the presence of Coyotes influenced lynx occupancy (Bayne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). In the contiguous US, the primary threat to lynx is habitat loss or fragmentation. Maintaining connectivity with the abundant northern lynx population is considered essential for recovery of southern lynx populations (Ruediger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Nordstrom 2005,Walpole <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Squires <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) especially with warmer climate (Hoving <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Caroll 2005). Older multi-storied forest provide winter habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare (Koehler <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Squires <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) in the western US fire frequency has increased four-fold in the western U.S. in boreal forests that supports lynx and this disturbance is expected to increase with warmer climate (Westerling <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006) . However, young dense conifer forest also provides habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare, thus natural disturbance and logging practices that foster dense understoreys of conifers can benefit lynx and hares (Burdett 2008, Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, and Walpole <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Climate change increases insect-related disturbance to boreal forests (Fleming <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Logan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition from other predators whose populations have increased in recent decades may also affect lynx through direct mortality or competition (Bunnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Bayne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, but see Kolbe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). The USFWS concluded that trapping was not responsible for lower lynx numbers at the edge of their range (USFWS 2000). Since listed as threatened, only a few lynx are captured and die in traps or snares set for other furbearers (DelGiudice <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Although lynx have been killed on logging roads with lower traffic volumes and speeds (Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), roads with high traffic speed and volumes may result in more road mortalities (Moen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Although, hybridization with bobcats has been found by genetic analysis in Minnesota, Maine, and New Brunswick (Schwartz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Homyack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008), hybridization does not appear to threaten southern lynx populations (Homyack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).","The Canada Lynx is primarily found in Canada and Alaska, where it is managed and trapped for its fur. It is considered Endangered in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Cape Breton), and has been extirpated from Prince Edward Island and mainland Nova Scotia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Parker 2001, Poole 2003, Nova Scotia Lynx Recovery Team 2006). In the contiguous US, lynx populations are smaller and protected from harvest. In 2000, lynx were federally listed as threatened (USFWS 2000) in 14 States. Currently, resident breeding populations of lynx are supported in four States: Maine, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. Lynx populations in Maine have increased in recent years (Vashon <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The abundance of lynx in Maine likely has contributed to the recent occurrence of lynx in New Hampshire and Vermont, including evidence of reproduction (Vashon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). The only significant recent decline in lynx numbers has occurred in Washington following recent forest fires (Koehler <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Lynx remain relatively uncommon in Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho and are absent in Oregon, New York, Wisconsin, and Michigan (USFWS 2000). Lynx were reintroduced unsuccessfully in northern New York state in the late 1980s (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), and more recently, successfully, in Colorado where some offspring born in Colorado have also reproduced (Devineau <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). In the northern parts of their range, lynx populations undergo dramatic fluctuations roughly every ten years. These population fluctuations follow the regular cycles of population increase and decline of their primary prey, the Snowshoe Hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>). This pattern of fluctuation is evident in lynx fur trade records dating back to the early 1800s (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the southern parts of their range, lynx and hares appear to maintain a relatively stable but low density (Parker 2001). Schwartz <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2003) documented reduced genetic variation in lynx from the peripheral areas of the range.",Stable,"Canada Lynx generally occupy the boreal forest regions of North America. Its range is coincident with that of their main prey, the Snowshoe Hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>) (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Lynx occur throughout most of mainland Alaska and occupy 95% of their historic range in Canada (Parker 2001, Poole 2003). In the contiguous United States, lynx historically occurred in 24 states (McKelvey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000), possibly ranging as far down the Rocky mountain chain to include a 25th, New Mexico (Frey 2006). However, there is some uncertainty about whether an occurrence or even many occurrences means the area is part of their historic range (McKelvey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000). In 2000, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed lynx as Threatened in 14 States: Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Although a recovery plan has not been written, in 2005 the US Fish and Wildlife Service identified six ""core"" areas for recovery where there had been evidence of lynx reproduction within the last 20 years: northern Maine and New Hampshire, northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern Idaho, the Kettle mountain range and “Wedge area” between the Kettle and Columbia rivers of Washington state, the northern Cascade range of Washington state, and the Greater Yellowstone area of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho (Nordstrom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005). A reintroduced population in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado was identified as a provisional core area where 218 lynx from Canada and Alaska were released between 1999 and 2006. Although there is evidence of reproduction, the long-term viability of this population has not been demonstrated (Devineau <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).",See details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Although Canada Lynx are one of five North American furbearers included on CITES Appendix II, in order to monitor the international trade of their fur, there are no quotas or suspensions currently in place. In Canada, the national and provincial governments manage harvests by region (Government of U.S. 2007), using closed seasons, quotas, limited entry and long-term trapping concessions (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the US, trapping takes place only in Alaska, and harvest quotas are increased during periods of population increase and decreased during periods of cyclic decline (Government of U.S.&#160;2007).<br/><br/>The lynx population in the contiguous US was listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2000, due to inadequate regulatory mechanisms to protect lynx or lynx habitat on Federal lands (USFWS 2000) requiring the US government to develop a recovery plan and identify critical habitat for lynx (Nordstrom 2005). In the absence of a recovery plan, activities on federal lands are guided by the lynx conservation assessment and strategy (Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013).<br/><br/>The US Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended various measures to trappers (e.g., avoid the use of hares or rabbits as bait) to reduce accidental taking of lynx in traps set for other furbearers (Golden and Krause 2003). In addition, several States have passed trapping regulations to further reduce accidental capture of lynx in traps set for other furbearers (Del Giudice <em>et al.</em> 2007, Vashon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Critical habitat designations only apply to federal lands or private lands with federally funded or permitted activities. This designation gives the federal government the authority to manage activities that affect the designated habitat. In 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published a revised designation of critical habitat. The designation significantly increased a 2006 designation of 4,768 square miles within the boundaries of Voyagers National Park in Minnesota, Glacier National Park in Montana, and North Cascades National Park in Washington (USFWS 2009). In total, 39,000 square miles of critical lynx habitat was designated in 2009 as follows:<br/><br/>Maine: Approximately 9,497 square miles in portions of Aroostook, Franklin, Penobscot, Piscataquis and Somerset Counties.<br/><br/>Minnesota: Approximately 8,065 square miles in portions of Cook, Koochiching, Lake, and St. Louis Counties, and Superior National Forest.<br/><br/>Northern Rocky Mountains: Approximately 10,102 square miles in portions of Boundary County in Idaho, and Flathead, Glacier, Granite, Lake, Lewis and Clark, Lincoln, Missoula, Pondera, Powell and Teton Counties in Montana. This area includes the Flathead Indian Reservation, National Forest lands and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in the Garnet Resource Area. North Cascades: Approximately 1,836 square miles in portions of Chelan and Okanogan Counties which includes BLM lands in the Spokane District. Greater Yellowstone Area: Approximately 9,500 square miles in Gallatin, Park, Sweetgrass, Stillwater, and Carbon Counties in Montana, and Park, Teton, Fremont, Sublette, and Lincoln Counties in Wyoming. The Kettle range of Washington state was not included as critical habitat due to lack of recent evidence of reproduction, and the reintroduced population of Colorado and Utah in the southern Rockies was also not included due to lack of evidence that it is self-sustaining. In September of 2013, for the 3rd time since lynx were listed as threatened, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed revising lynx critical habitat. If revised, an additional 632 square miles will be designated as critical habitat (USFWS 2013).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The species occurs on a large extent of Chiloé Island and in Nahuelbuta National Park (Jiménez and MacMahon 2004). Surveys have revealed that the species is also present on private properties with well-preserved native forests outside of Nahuelbuta National Park. Until recently these were the only known populations for the species, with the exception of a skin found in Punta Chanchán, midway between Nahuelbuta and Chiloé (Vila&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). However, the recent finding of a Darwin’s Fox killed by a dog near Gorbea (D’Elia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013) and several records in three protected areas in the Valdivian Coastal Range (Farías&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) have confirmed a larger extent of occurrence than previously reported (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of individuals has also been confirmed north of Llanquihue Lake, on the foothills of the Andes and approximately 60 km east to the coastal mountain range (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The Darwin’s Fox was previously classified in 2004 and 2008 as Critically Endangered based on an estimated population size of “less than 250 mature individuals with at least 90% of the population occurring in one subpopulation” (Chiloé&#160;Island) (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). New distribution information (Vila <em>et al</em>. 2004, D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs., A. Farías pers. obs.) indicates that the extent of occurrence of the species is much larger than originally thought and clearly exceeds the threshold for listing it as threatened under criterion B. No reliable population data are available, although foxes seem to be more abundant and to occur at higher densities in Chiloé than on the mainland (J. Jiménez and A. Farías pers. obs.). A very conservative minimum estimate suggests at least 412 and 227 mature individuals occur on Chiloé and on the mainland, respectively. Based on this estimate, the species does not meet the thresholds for listing it as Critically Endangered under criterion C or for listing as Critically Endangered or Endangered under criterion D. Despite the conservative minimum estimate, it is nonetheless likely that total population size does not exceed 2,500 mature individuals and hence the species would meet the threshold for listing as Endangered under criterion C. Since the subpopulation on&#160;Chiloé&#160;very likely exceeds 250 mature individuals, it cannot meet subcriteria C2a(i) or C2a(ii).&#160;However, the combined impacts of forest loss and the risk posed by domestic dogs (especially of contracting Canine Distemper Virus, a risk supported by high seroprevalence in dog populations in areas inhabited by Darwin’s Fox [Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015b]), and the evidence for the impacts of these threats on populations, suggest a high likelihood that the population could undergo a decline exceeding 20% in the coming 6-8 years (two generations). Hence the species would meet the subcriteria for listing as EN under C1. It is acknowledged that this assessment might be slightly precautionary if the likelihood or rate of decline is overstated. In that case, the species would at least be listed as Vulnerable as it meets the threshold for listing as Vulnerable under criterion C, and based on the minimum estimate of subpopulation size for Chiloé would also meet subcriterion C2a(i). In summary, the species is considered to qualify for listing as Endangered under criterion C1.","<p>Early research in Nahuelbuta suggested Darwin's Foxes were associated with dense forest (Jaksic <em>et al</em>. 1990, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1991). More recent radio-telemetry data indicate that animals are found more often in dense <em>Araucaria</em>-<em>Nothofagus</em> forest, open <em>Nothofagus</em> forest and occasionally in open pastures (McMahon <em>et al</em>. 1999). Preliminary data on camera trapping 20 km north-west of Nahuelbuta National Park indicate a similar pattern of occupancy of habitat types (J. Jiménez pers. obs.). More recently, Darwin’s Foxes in Nahuelbuta have been found to be positively associated with native forest availability, and negatively associated with roads (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a). Positive response of foxes to fine grain habitat structure suggests commercial plantations may also provide complementary habitat and food resources for this diet-generalist species in Nahuelbuta (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015b). They have been recorded to ~1,400 m elevation in Nahuelbuta (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>In the coastal range of Los Ríos Region, Darwin’s Foxes have been primarily recorded in old-growth and secondary evergreen forests, though they were also detected in unmanaged <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. plantations (Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014). Foxes are apparently more frequent in the southern area of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, an area that was less impacted by forest substitution and that have lower human (and dog) densities than the northern area (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Finally, records near the Llanquihue Lake were in a highly fragmented forest with intensive dairy farms having large pastures with linear strips of degraded Valdivian forest along streams (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>In Chiloé, foxes use a variety of habitats. A study conducted in Chiloé, found that foxes used second-growth forests and scrublands according to availability, old-growth forest less than expected according to availability and that the use of dunes varied between individuals (Jiménez 2007). The consumption of crustaceans and direct observation provides evidence that sandy beaches are also used by this species (Elgueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jiménez 2007). In the north-east of the island, where the forest is fragmented, Darwin’s Fox occur in the larger forest fragments (Farías and Jaksic 2011). Home ranges vary between 103 and 488 ha (Jiménez 2007).</p>","<p>Domestic dogs and associated diseases are likely the main threats for Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez&#160;and McMahon 2004). Dogs are a common problem in Chilean protected areas, including each of those where the Darwin’s Fox is present. Domestic dogs would represent a risk for foxes through intra-guild killing, as well as through disease transmission (Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Cabello <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b). The death of Darwin’s Foxes due to dog attacks has been reported both on the mainland (D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013) and in Chiloé (Espinosa 2011, J. Jiménez pers. obs.). Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015a) found a negative correlation between the areas used by dogs and foxes in Nahuelbuta. Accordingly, in Chiloé Island, Darwin’s Foxes are rare or absent from old-growth forests frequently visited by dogs, while they are frequently recorded at camera traps in scrublands when dogs are absent (A. Farías pers. obs.), suggesting spatial displacement.&#160;It is important to note that the dog problem that affects Darwin’s Foxes, is caused in most, if not all, cases by poorly managed free-ranging dogs and not feral dogs (D. Moreira pers. obs., E.A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The risk of disease spillover from dogs (mainly Canine Distemper Virus, CDV) is considered a major threat for Darwin’s Fox populations (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Exposure of dogs to CDV has been shown in the proximity of Nahuelbuta National Park (Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015b) and Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Furthermore, exposure to CDV has been reported for invasive American minks (<em>Neovison vison</em>) in areas were the Darwin’s Fox is present (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014), as well as for Chilla (<em>Lycalopex griseus</em>) and Culpeo (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>) in other regions (Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Additionally, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported the death of three radio-collared foxes in Chiloé in sympatry with free-ranging dogs, suggesting that mortality could have been caused by CDV, although conclusive evidence was not available. CDV epizootics in canids have been reported worldwide (e.g., Goller <em>et al</em>. 2010, Di Sabatino <em>et al</em>. 2014), and CDV was implicated in a major decline in the population of the Island Fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) in Santa Catalina Island (Timm <em>et al</em>. 2009). In South America, Megid <em>et al</em>. (2009, 2010) reported CDV-related mortalities in wild canids in Brazil, and in Chile, Moreira and Stutzin (2005) reported the death of 27 Chilla and Culpeo foxes due to CDV in Coquimbo Region. The lack of conclusive evidence of declines due to CDV in the Darwin’s Fox may be well explained by lack of information, rather than by the absence of outbreaks.<br/><br/>Darwin’s Foxes can also be subject to human-caused mortality. According to J. Jiménez (pers. obs.) and Espinosa (2011), local people in Chiloé reported killing foxes because they attack domestic animals and to obtain their fur. Foxes rescued from traps as well as captured and translocated after predation on poultry have also been reported in Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.). Stowhas (2012) also indicated that local people reported killing foxes (undetermined species) in an area that included the surroundings of Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park, and Valdivian Coastal Reserve, as a response to predation on poultry. In Nahuelbuta range, foxes (without distinguishing to the level of species) are often considered as problem animals (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, Darwin’s Fox is not commonly persecuted or killed by local people (but see McMahon <em>et al</em>. 1999) and its conservation would show a high social support (D. Moreira pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Forest loss is an important threat. The highest rates of forest loss occur in the coastal range of the Araucanía Region, where Nahuelbuta is located. There, the annual loss rate observed for the 1999-2008 period reached 4.8%, the second highest reported for Chilean temperate forest (Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the Valdivian Coastal Range, the net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (and the gross loss reached 30%), but the loss rate was higher for the 1985-1999 period than for the 1999-2011 period (Zamorano-Elgueta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In northern Chiloé and Maullín, the annual rates of forest loss was close to 1% (1985-2007), although in the case of Chiloé this rate rose to 1.4% for the 1999-2007 period (Echeverría <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both in the Araucanía and Valdivian cases, cleared native forest was frequently converted to forestry plantations (Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although Darwin’s Fox has been recorded in plantations (Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), evidence from the population in Nahuelbuta shows that foxes select for native forest (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a). However, if managed through an increase of native understory cover, commercial plantations may provide complementary habitats and food resources for this species (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015b). Human-induced fires are an always-latent threat, especially for the Nahuelbuta range (D. Moreira pers. obs.). On the other hand, deforestation may favour other (larger sized) fox species (i.e. <em>Lycalopex</em>&#160;<em>griseus </em>and <em>L. culpaeus</em>), better adapted to open areas (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2010), which can displace Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1991). The indirect effects of changes in land cover through alteration of interaction webs are still insufficiently known.<br/><br/>Indirect threats that need to be considered include the construction of bridges, highways and roads. Of major concern is the projected construction of the bridge connecting Chiloé to the mainland. This bridge, if barriers are not implemented, may facilitate the invasion of the island by other species such as congeneric foxes and Pumas (<em>Puma concolor</em>), with unknown, but potentially serious consequences for these populations. Road construction and improvement is an additional concern, given that they facilitate dog (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a, Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2015) and human movement, and can lead to land cover change (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2005). Existing roads, as well as the construction of new roads and/or the improvement of existing public roads, is a concern for Nahuelbuta (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015) and for Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Other threats that need to be taken into account include the translocation of rescued and problem animals (J. Cabello pers. obs.) and illegal tenure of foxes as pets (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).</p>","<p>In Ahuenco, Chiloé, Jiménez (2007) estimated a density of 0.92 foxes/km²&#160;in an area that seems to be prime for the species. In Nahuelbuta, D. Moreira <em>et al</em>. (pers. obs.) have recently found that foxes are patchily distributed across the landscape reaching densities of <em>c.</em> 0.75 foxes/km²&#160;in areas with less disturbed native forest. Foxes are described as common in Chiloé, except for the northern and eastern areas of the island (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of foxes seems to be largely explained by native forest (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Farías and Jaksic (2011) report for north-eastern Chiloé (likely among the less suitable area for foxes in the island, Jiménez and McMahon 2004) that occupancy was associated with fragment size, with larger fragments mostly occupied. Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015a) report occupancy of 32% for Nahuelbuta (around 10% of cameras with detections). Preliminary data from the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and Alerce Costero National Park (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs., A. Farías and Svensson pers. obs.) suggests similar detection rates than for Nahuelbuta. Genetic variability is extremely low for both populations, and despite its presumed larger population size, is lower in Chiloé than in mainland (J. Cabello <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Polymorphism in animals from Chiloé is lower than in other species (Cabello and Dávila 2014).<br/><br/>Jiménez and McMahon (2004) estimated that the extant Darwin’s Fox population was 78 individuals for Nahuelbuta National Park (and less than 100 for the Nahuelbuta range) and around 500 in Chiloé.&#160;For the purpose of this account a conservative approach was used to obtain an educated guess of the minimum population size of the Darwin’s Fox. Foxes were assumed to occupy 32% of the areas defined in the geographic range (see above). This number derives from the study in Nahuelbuta mentioned above (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2015a), and is considered conservative especially when applied to Chiloé for three reasons. First, occupancy was not modelled at the home-range scale, but rather based on camera trap points; it is expected that increasing grain to the home range scale will also increase occupancy estimates. Second, Nahuelbuta is the northern limit of the distribution and the condition of the habitat is less favourable than in other areas such as Chiloé (J. Jiménez and D. Moreira pers.&#160;obs.), thus lower densities are expected in&#160;Nahuelbuta. Third, Nahuelbuta is located in an area that has been severely affected by land conversion (see Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015), likely representing the most disturbed area within the current distribution of this fox. We then assumed that in occupied areas the density of mature foxes was 0.2 foxes/km². This number was calculated (1/488) from the largest home range (488 ha) reported in Jiménez (2007) and assumes that mature foxes do not have overlapping home ranges, an assumption that is extremely conservative as Jiménez (2007) showed high home range overlap (and a density of 0.92 foxes/km²). This procedure was equivalent to applying a density of 6.6 foxes/100 km². We did not attempt to estimate an upper limit of the population size. As a result we estimated a minimum of 412 mature individuals for Chiloé and 227 mature individuals for the areas in mainland where the fox is known to be present. If considering the areas where the fox is potentially extant, the minimum population size in mainland would approach 489 individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"Darwin’s Fox is endemic to Chile occurring in at least two distinct populations (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). One is found in the forests of Chiloé Island, while the second population is on the coastal range in mainland Chile. The mainland population is apparently discontinuous. Until recently, the fox was known to occur only in the Nahuelbuta range (e.g., Medel<em> et al.</em> 1990, Jiménez and McMahon 2004). However, recent records confirm the presence of the species in the Valdivian coastal range (Vila <em>et al</em>. 2004, D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014), including at least three protected areas: Alerce Costero National Park, the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (both ca. 40°05'S, 73°30'W), and the Oncol Park (39°42'S, 73°18'W). Nahuelbuta and the Valdivian Coastal Range are separated by heavily disturbed landscapes. A recent record near Maullín (41°27'S, 73°48'W) (A. Farías, pers. obs.) suggests that the species is potentially extant between Bueno River and Maullín. Finally, a few individuals detected in 2014 north of Llanquihue Lake&#160;(40°53'S, 72°50'W, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), on the foothills of the Andes, would suggest that the range of this species is larger than thought, although it cannot be ruled out that such individuals belong to the same subpopulation as those in the coastal range.&#160;In summary, the fox is considered to be extant in the following areas (see map): Nahuelbuta-Caramávida, Lastarria, Oncol-Chanchán, Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park and surrounding forest, Maullín and Puerto Octay. Darwin’s Fox is potentially extant in the forested areas between the Bueno River and Maullín and the forested areas north to Mehuín (between Gorbea and Chanchán records).","There is no commercial use of this species. However, some animals have been illegally kept in captivity as pets (Jiménez and McMahon 2004), and there is some limited off-take for fur (Espinosa 2011).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Legislation<br/></strong>Included on CITES - Appendix II. Protected by Chilean law since 1929 (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986). Darwin’s Fox is listed as endangered in Chile (DS 151/2007 MINSEGPRES). Since 2012, the Ministry of the Environment is working in the elaboration of the Recovery, Conservation and Management plan for the species (RECOGE for its Spanish acronym), but this plan is not in effect yet.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in protected areas<br/></strong>The Darwin’s Fox occurs in the following public protected areas: Nahuelbuta National Park (Araucanía Administrative Region), Alerce Costero National Park (Los Ríos Administrative Region), and Chiloé National Park (Los Lagos Administrative Region). In addition, the species is found in the following private protected areas: Caramávida Reserve (Biobío Administrative Region), Oncol Park and Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Los Ríos Administrative Region), and Tantauco, Ahuenco and Tepuhueico Parks (Los Lagos Administrative Region). Some of these protected areas are targeting the species through monitoring, supporting research or attempting to address the dog problem (e.g., Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Darwin’s Fox is one of the conservation targets (Darwin’s Fox, guigna and pudu) of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Following the criteria by Simonetti and Mella (1997), and the densities reported by Jiménez (2007), it is possible to assume that good quality areas of around 550 km²<sup>&#160;</sup>in size could sustain ~500 individuals (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2015). Tantauco Park in Chiloé, and the area protected by the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and Alerce Costero National Park as a whole, are the only protected areas that meet this criterion, although this does not guarantee the existence of such a number of foxes, as they appear to be scarcer in the Valdivian population (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez and A. Farías, pers. obs.), and the density of foxes in Ahuenco could be much higher than in other areas (Jiménez 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Species-based measures<br/></strong>Vaccination of dogs against CDV has been conducted around some of the above-mentioned protected areas with the aim of preventing disease outbreaks that could affect Darwin’s Foxes (e.g., Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Current efforts to understand problems related to disease and its management in this species include the project ”Saving Darwin’s Fox: A Conservation Medicine Approach” led by Buin Zoo and several local organizations including among them Chiloé Silvestre and Parque Tantauco, as well as several universities.<br/><br/>Environmental education efforts are being conducted by several stakeholders. These include efforts by the Ministry of Environment, CONAF (Chile’s Forest Service), as well as private organizations such as the Committee for the Rescue of Nahuelbuta,&#160;Tantauco and The Nature Conservancy.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity<br/></strong>Currently, the only known captive Darwin’s Foxes are kept by Fauna Andina near Villarrica, where successful reproduction has been achieved in two consecutive years. These animals have been rescued from dog attacks and illegal ownership from Chiloé&#160;(F. Vidal pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge<br/></strong>Most known populations are currently being studied by researchers from multiple institutions. Key topics under study include genetics (J. Cabello pers. obs.), disease (E. Hidalgo pers. comm.), occupancy and habitat use (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). The later topic still deserves clarification regarding (1) the presence of the species between the Bueno and Maullín rivers (i.e. coastal mountain range of Osorno Province), (2) its potential presence in the Andes and lowlands between the Andes and the Coastal Range, and (3) under-explored areas in continental Chiloé. Furthermore, accurate information is needed regarding the abundance of the species in each of these populations.<br/><br/>Key issues that need to be addressed include the management of domestic dogs. Irresponsible ownership is the rule rather than the exception in Chile. Despite long legislative discussion, no serious solution is in place for this problem. Effective enforcement of responsible ownership is absolutely necessary to address this problem. Recently CONAF passed some rules that limit the entrance of dogs to protected areas (CONAF 2015), but these measures need to be supported by a coherent legislation.<br/><br/>The adequate management of exotic plantations is an important priority. Recent studies suggest that several forest species can use forest plantations if they have dense native understory (Simonetti <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thus, leaving understory in exotic tree plantations may be key to maintain connectivity in Darwin’s Fox populations, especially in Nahuelbuta (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2016). The challenge is to implement these recommendations.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
110023718,714,Ailurus fulgens,Endangered,A2cde+3cde+4cde,2015,2015-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Red Panda is listed as Endangered because its population has plausibly&#160;declined by 50% over the last three generations (estimated at 18 years) and this decline is projected to continue, and probably intensify, in the next three generations. There is no credible quantification of decline rate from anywhere in the species' range. The overall forest loss rate at appropriate altitudes&#160;in the species' range is suspected to be sufficient for Near Threatened status (about 25% in the last three generations), but Red Panda populations are suspected to be declining much faster, reflecting a battery of direct threats, this species' fragmented present range, and poor survival in fragmented areas. (1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This decline is ongoing and is likely to result in extinction of this species, projected to occur within the period 2020-2050 if nothing changes.</p>  <p>The Common Hamster's range has declined in almost all European countries. Local and regional extirpations and extinctions have occurred in 13 European countries and in both the European and Asiatic parts of Russia. These include nearly 67% of the range states for this species. The decline does not affect only West European countries, but also affects the global range with declines in Russia and the eastern part of its range evidenced. From the previous assessment in 2016 there has been an estimated decline in the species area of occupancy of 226,835 km² and a 468,634 km² decline in its extent of occurrence.</p><br/><p></p>","Its original habitat was fertile steppe and grassland, but it has successfully spread into a variety of anthropogenic habitats including meadows, croplands (especially cereals), and field edges, road verges and scrubby fallow areas on farms. In eastern parts of its range it is found quite often in gardens and orchards, in close proximity to human habitation. It is more abundant in these man-made habitats than it is in natural grassland. It prefers relatively deep, heavy soils, in which it digs extensive burrows. Its diet mainly consists of the green parts of plants and seeds, supplemented by invertebrates and, occasionally, small vertebrates. At high densities it is considered an agricultural pest in some areas (Nechay 2000).","The causes of the global decline are complex, are not fully understood yet, and there are many hypotheses attempting to explain the breakdown of the species. Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed.  The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered “island populations”.  Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek <em>et al</em>. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye <em>et al</em>. 2012; Neuman <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005; Reiners <em>et al</em>. 2014). Agricultural intensification—specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides—are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli <em>et al</em>. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).  Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston <em>et al</em>. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke <em>et al</em>. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations.","<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has undergone severe range and population declines in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, and now has a highly fragmented distribution in these areas. The decline of the Common Hamster's range and numbers covers its whole distribution range (see Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016 for detailed analysis with maps). Extirpations and extinction on local and regional scales have occurred in a number of countries including Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (Ambros <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bihari 2003, Demyanchik 2004, Ziomek and Banaszek 2007, Tkadlec <em>et </em>al. 2012, Sidorov <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rusin <em>et al</em>. 2013, Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is extinct in Switzerland (Hediger 1944, Mohr 1954, no recent records) and most probably in Georgia, where it was present in one locality (Vinogradov and Gromov 1952, Bukhnikashvili and Kandaurov 2004). To the best knowledge of the assessors, it was never present in Luxembourg which was listed as country of occurrence in the previous assessment.<br/><br/>In general, decline was shown in each country where monitoring of the species was performed. The relative occurrence of the Common Hamster before and after 1970 was compared in Russian, Belarus and Ukrainian provinces, and Moldova. Before 1970, the Common Hamster was abundant in 28 provinces, common in 37 and rare in 20. Today, the species is abundant only in eight and common in 27 provinces, but it is rare in 42 and extinct in eight provinces. Moreover, the species' range is becoming or is already fragmented, due to it vanishing from more than 75% of its range in Central and Eastern Europe. There are only seven fragments in eastern part of the range where the species is common or abundant: two are in Ukraine, one in Caucasus, two in Volga and Ural area and two in Siberia. Nevertheless, the most important fact is that population decline and fragmentation in general concerns the whole eastern range (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has a large global range, extending from Western Europe, through Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Kazakhstan, reaching as far East as the Yenisey river (Asian Russia). In Europe, it occurs from Belgium, the Netherlands and Eastern France (Alsace) in the West to Russia in the East, and from central Germany, Poland and Russia in the North to Bulgaria in the South (Panteleyev 1998, Weinhold 1999). It is found from sea level to 650 m (Nechay 2000).","<p>In the past the Common Hamsters were intensively used in fur trade. Tens of millions individuals were harvested annually, but this hunting pressure had ended by 1970s in most of the species' range.

Specific conservation recommendations to improve the status of the species in Western Europe are detailed in Stubbe and Stubbe (1998), Nechay (2000), Weinhold (2009) and various other authors. These focus on subsidizing farmers to manage agricultural habitats appropriately, to restore key habitat elements, such as lucerne fields, offering cover and food after harvest, and minimizing the use of pesticides.<br/> <br/> In recent years reintroductions have been carried out in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and this conservation measure seems the most successful so far as it stops local population decrease.<br/> <br/> The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention adopted an action plan for the conservation of the European Hamster in 2009 (Weinhold 2009), recommending the urgent need to update population data and trends in the Eastern part of the range as well as the preparation of protection plans in those countries. Conservation measures are currently carried out and monitoring of population trends takes place regularly only in Western Europe (Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Germany and Austria). These are four out of 18 countries belonging to the range of <em>Cricetus cricetus</em> where it is extant. Monitoring of the species was performed in several other countries (i.e., in Poland, Czech Republic and Ukraine, partially in Belarus, Slovakia, Romania and Russia). Monitoring is urgently needed in remaining range countries.

111975602,6927,Lycalopex griseus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Chilla is widespread in plains and mountains on both sides of the Andes in Chile and Argentina. Populations in the southern half of Argentina, where habitat is more favourable, are essentially stable. Their status in the northern half of the country is unknown. In Chile, they are considered frequent in the north, scarce in central Chile, and common-abundant in the south. It is considered rare in its limited range in Peru. Despite having been overexploited for their fur in the past, and ongoing widespread, unselective hunting in many areas, Chillas do not seem to be decreasing in number. The species is not considered threatened at present.","The Chilla occurs in steppes, ""pampas"" (grasslands), and ""matorral"" (scrublands) (Olrog and Lucero 1981). They generally inhabit plains and low mountains, but they have been reported to occur as high as 3,500–4,000 m (see Marquet <em>et al.</em> 1993, Jayat <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although Chillas occur in a variety of habitats, they prefer shrubby open areas. In central Chile, they hunt more commonly in flat, open patches of low height (1–2 m) scrub than in areas with dense vegetation or ravines. Yet, they do visit ravines, apparently in search of fruit (Jaksic <em>et al</em>. 1980, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1996). In southern Chile (Parque Nacional Nahuelbuta), Chillas also prefer open areas to those more dense patches where Darwin's Foxes occur (Jaksic <em>et al</em>. 1990, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1990, Medel <em>et al</em>. 1990). Durán <em>et al</em>. (1985) found that in Chilean Patagonia, their typical habitat was the shrubby steppe composed of ""coirón"" (<em>Festuca</em> spp., <em>Stipa</em> spp.) and ""ñires"" (<em>Nothofagus antarctica</em>), and that burning and destruction of forests in order to augment the land for sheep farming seems to have been advantageous for Chillas. A similar preference was detected in Parque Nacional Torres del Paine, where 58% of the 12 monitored individuals used matorral shrubland or <em>Nothofagus</em> thicket habitat within their home ranges, more than was expected (Johnson and Franklin 1994b).&#160;<br/><br/>Chillas are tolerant to very different climatic regimes from remarkably hot and dry areas, such as the Atacama coastal desert in northern Chile (less than 0 mm average annual rainfall, 22°C mean annual temperature), to the humid regions of the temperate Valdivian forest (2,000 mm average annual rainfall, 12°C mean annual temperature) and the cold Tierra del Fuego (ca. 400 mm average annual rainfall, 7°C mean annual temperature).","Chillas are still hunted (though apparently with much less intensity) in Chilean and Argentinean Patagonia and has been on the increase in recent years (from 2000 to 2003 the number of ""grey fox"" pelts exported from Argentina increased from 30,263 to 188,997; Funes <em>et al</em>. 2006). Chillas are also perceived as lamb predators by many rural people in Argentina and Chile (Jimenez <em>et al</em>. 1996, Travaini <em>et al</em>. 2000). Consequently, illegal trapping is still widespread in some regions of Chile and Argentina, mainly related to controlling predation.","In Argentina, Olrog and Lucero (1981) considered the Chilla to be ""locally common"". In the latter country, relative abundance of Chillas has been evaluated mainly through the scent stations technique. Data collected in Patagonia and Mendoza from 1989 to 2003 (Funes <em>et al</em>. 2006) suggest that populations are essentially stable in the southern half of Argentina where habitat is more favourable. The decline in fur demand in the 1990s led to increased Chilla densities (Novaro <em>et al</em>. 2004). They are reported to have expanded their distribution in Tierra del Fuego since their introduction (A. Novaro, in González del Solar and Rau 2004);&#160;J. Bellati (in&#160;González del Solar and Rau 2004) estimated an ecological density of 1 individual/km² in Tierra del Fuego in 1996.&#160;A recent increase in population numbers has also been observed in the southern Argentine Patagonia (Travaini <em>et al</em>. 2007). Interspecific competition with the dominant Culpeo appears to have a strong effect on Chilla population dynamics where the two species co-occur&#160;(Novaro <em>et al</em>. 2004, Travaini <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Stable,"This species is widespread in plains and mountains on both sides of the Andes, from northern Chile (17°S) down to Tierra del Fuego (54°S).<br/><br/>In Argentina, they occur in the western and southern arid and semi-arid regions of the country, from ca. 23°S (Jujuy and Salta) to Tierra del Fuego, and from the eastern foothills of the Andes mountain range to meridian 66°W, reaching the Atlantic coast (ca. 63°W) south from Río Negro. They are recorded from the following provinces in Argentina: Jujuy (Jayat <em>et al.</em> 1999), Salta (Mares <em>et al</em>. 1996), Tucumán, Catamarca, Santiago del Estero, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza, west of San Luis, Neuquén, west of La Pampa, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego (Osgood 1943, Olrog and Lucero 1981).<br/><br/>In Chile, the species ranges from the I Administrative Region (Atacama Province) in the north, south to the Strait of Magellan (XII Administrative Region, Magallanes Province) and Tierra del Fuego (Medel and Jaksic 1988, Marquet <em>et al</em>. 1993), and from the western foothills of the Andes mountain range to the Pacific coast (71–73°W). They were introduced to Tierra del Fuego in 1951 in an attempt to control rabbit (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) infestation (Jaksic and Yáñez 1983).<br/><br/>Their presence has been confirmed recently for the coast of southern Peru, from Lima to Tacna. The populations from Peru would be separated by the Atacama desert from those in northern Chile (Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pacheco 2014).<br/><br/>Other populations have been reported to exist in some of the southern Atlantic islands, including Malvinas/Falklands (Olrog and Lucero 1981), but this requires confirmation.","Chillas have been heavily hunted for their pelts in the past.&#160;Ojeda and Mares (1982) report that 5,789,011 pelts were legally exported from Argentina generically labelled as “zorro gris” (grey fox) from 1972 to 1979.&#160;However, inferences on the historical rate of Chilla extraction are difficult, since official pelt-export reports apparently conflated data corresponding to three different species, namely the Chilla, the Crab-eating Fox (<em>Cerdocyon thous</em>), and, particularly, the Pampas Fox. Legal exports of Chilla pelts from Argentina markedly decreased from 1980 onwards, and by 1990 only ~33,000 skins were exported. Numbers of fox skins reported exported from Chile are consistently lower than Argentina (see Iriarte and Jaksic 1986 for a review).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Included in CITES – Appendix II.<br/><br/>Resolution 144/83 of the former National Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development of Argentina categorises this species as ""In Danger"".

Palacios pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In Chile, the passing of the 1972 furbearer's protection law appears to have curtailed the exports of pelts (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986, Iriarte 2000). Currently, all Chilean populations are protected by law N° 19,473 [1996], except for those from Tierra del Fuego, where it is considered a pest and can be hunted with no limitations (A.

112910221,4037,Catopuma badia,Endangered,C1,2016,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Borneo Bay Cat, a Bornean endemic, remains one of the least known and infrequently recorded of the world’s wild cats, hindering efforts to assess its conservation needs and status. Historical records, incidental observations, and more recently, camera trap photographic captures and a niche modelling exercise (Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> submitted) indicate that this elusive felid appears restricted to natural and semi-natural forest cover but, within such habitat, exhibits some degree of habitat plasticity. Importantly, however, the extensive areas of swamp forest and oil palm plantations on Borneo do not appear to be used by this felid. A Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based habitat suitability analysis, using presence-only data coupled with expert opinion, estimated that the Bay Cat’s current area of occupancy (AOO) extends to approximately 221,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Borneo Carnivore Symposium 2011, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> submitted). Due to a lack of sufficient data, this analysis was unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range. Hunting could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO. A GIS exercise as part of the current assessment used the habitat suitability assessment alongside landcover data for Borneo for the years 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) and showed that the estimated AOO decreased by 29.8% during this time period, primarily as a result of forest loss and conversion to oil palm. More recent satellite imagery shows that forest loss has continued to reduce the AOO in size (Gaveau <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), and it is likely that forest loss continues to this day, albeit at a reduced rate. In addition, some protected areas in Borneo are small, fragmented and isolated making them vulnerable to climate change and ineffective in conserving low-density species such as the bay cat (Scriven <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Because the species spends time on the ground, Bay Cats are prone to untargeted snaring and there is increasing evidence for the capture and export of Bay Cats for the illegal pet market. We estimate that the cumulative reduction in the population size as a consequence of degradation, poaching amounts and forest conversion, to between 20-30% in the past 12 years (two Bay Cat generations, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>No population density estimates exist for this felid. Nevertheless, the paucity of Bay Cat specimens collected during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries caused earlier authors to conclude that the species is naturally rare, a stance further bolstered by recent camera survey efforts. Indeed, photographic capture rates of the Bay Cat are substantially lower than that of the sympatric Sunda Clouded Leopard (<em>Neofelis diardi</em>), which is estimated to exist at low densities (1-4 individuals 100 km<sup>2</sup>: Brodie and Giordano 2012a, Wilting <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Loken <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpublished data) leading some authors to hypothesize that the Bay Cat is found at even lower densities (Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, but see Wearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure and a patchy distribution, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Bay Cat across the AOO may be as low as one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals could plausibly be fewer than 2,500 individuals indicating, in combination with the estimated past decline rate (&gt;30% in the past 12 years), a categorization of Endangered under EN C1.","The Borneo Bay Cat appears to be forest dependent, with records from hill and lowland forest as well as swamp forest (Meijaard 1997, Azlan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Hearn 2003, Bricknell 2003, Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Yasuda <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> submitted). It has been recorded from selectively logged forest of various levels of disturbance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Kitchener <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Meijaard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Hon 2011, Wearn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Mathai <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), but was estimated to occur at lower local abundance in logged forests than in unlogged forest (Brodie <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). It was not recorded during an intensive, felid-focused camera trap survey of oil palm plantations in Sabah (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Yue <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press). It has never been the focus of any ecological study and there is no information about its diet (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It occurs in both a reddish and grey colour phase. The bay cat appears to be primarily diurnal in nature, although not strictly so (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Nothing is known regarding the spatial ecology of this felid.","Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations pose the greatest threat to the Bay Cat. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020 (Rautner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Poaching, particularly the use of snares, poses a significant threat. Wildlife traders are aware of the species' rarity, and Bay Cats have been captured illegally from the wild for the skin and pet markets (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Azlan and Sanderson 2007).","There are no population density estimates for the Borneo Bay Cat in any part of its range, yet this elusive felid has long been considered uncommon. Noting the paucity of specimens collected during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, earlier authors concluded that the species was naturally rare. Even now, the Bay Cat is known from only 12 specimens (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 2004), and incidental observations remain few and far between (Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Meijaard <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). Since the advent of intensive camera trap surveys, however, many of them targeted at felids, there has been a slow but steady rise in the number of photographic captures of this felid (Azlan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Yasuda 2007, Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Wearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Gardner <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data). Nevertheless, even intensive felid focused camera trap surveys yield very few photographs, and photographic capture rates of the bay cat are substantially lower than that of the sympatric Sunda Clouded Leopard (<em>Neofelis diardi</em>), which is estimated to exist at low densities (1-4 individuals 100 km<sup>2</sup>: Brodie and Giordano 2012a, Wilting <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Sollmann <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Loken <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data). Such observations have led some authors to hypothesise that the Bay Cat is found at even lower densities (Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). It is unclear, however, whether this apparent lower detection rate is a reflection of true rarity or due to underlying factors that result in its elusiveness. Wearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>, (2013) compared photo-capture rates of Bay Cats from a number of studies in Borneo and showed that random placement of cameras can result in higher rates than that derived from targeted placement (trails, ridgelines, and logging roads), as is typical of camera trap surveys. Wearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013) suggested that the relative abundance of the bay cat may have hitherto been underestimated due to an underlying bias as a result of the use of non-random survey locations coupled with this felid’s particular use of space. A comparison of photo-capture rates between a randomised and a targeted survey of the Tawau Hills National Park in Sabah, however, found no evidence of elevated capture rates of this felid as a result of randomised camera deployment, and instead showed that a randomised survey approach reduced detection probability of all Bornean felids (Hearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>unpublished data).<br/><br/>It is important to highlight that while the increasing use of camera traps across the island of Borneo is slowly yielding more detections of this elusive cat, several intensive, felid-focused camera trap surveys have failed to detect this species (e.g., Tangkulap Forest Reserve, Segaliud Lokan Forest Reserve: Wilting <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data, Sepilok Forest Reserve: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data, numerous surveys in Kalimantan: Cheyne and Macdonald, unpublished data), despite a habitat suitability analysis (Bornean Carnivore Symposium, Hearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> submitted) predicting the cat to be present. Our estimate of the Bay Cat’s current area of occupancy (AOO) must consequently be viewed with caution.<br/><br/>Although further research is needed to draw more firm conclusions regarding the abundance and distribution of the Borno Bay Cat, the assessors have chosen to follow a precautionary approach, and estimate that the mean density of the Bay Cat throughout its area of occupancy (AOO) is around one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Extrapolation of this density to the estimated AOO suggests the population is plausibly around 2,200 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The Borneo Bay Cat is endemic to the island of Borneo, and until recently, its distribution was poorly understood. Although somewhat hindered by the low number of Bay Cat records, Meijaard (1997) collated historical records and contemporary observations of the Bay Cat and speculated that this felid was, and possibly still is, widely distributed on Borneo, a proposition later supported by Azlan and Sanderson (2007). Bolstered by the increasing number of Bay Cat records obtained from chance sightings (Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Meijaard <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005) and the increasing, but still relatively few camera trap records (Azlan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Yasuda 2007, Mohamed <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Wearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data), a MaxEnt habitat suitability modelling approach was developed during the Borneo Carnivore symposium in 2011 from presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and landuse covariates to make predictions regarding the current distribution of Bay Cats (Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> submitted). In support of Meijaard (1997), Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em>’s (submitted) model predicted that an extensive, contiguous, forested area of interior Borneo, in addition to a number of more isolated forested fragments, amounting to approximately 221,000 km<sup>2</sup>, may be currently occupied by the Bay Cat. Due to a lack of data, the habitat suitability exercise was unable to account for the potential impact of differential hunting pressure throughout this range, which potentially could be having a considerable impact, and our estimate may therefore represent an overly optimistic estimation of the current area of occupancy (AOO). Recent records of the Bay Cat stem from the Malaysian states of Sabah (Kitchener <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Mohamed <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Wearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data) and Sarawak (Dinets 2003, Azlan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Hon 2011, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Mathai <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the Indonesian provinces of East (Yasuda <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), West (Hearn 2003, Meijaard <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005), and Central (Bricknell 2003) Kalimantan, and Brunei (J.

114251609,41687,Ursus americanus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widespread and occupies a large portion of its historical range. The global population is estimated at more than twice that of all other species of bears combined.&#160;Within the United States, populations have been expanding numerically and geographically.&#160;Legal hunting is the primary cause of mortality and is well controlled by state and provincial management agencies in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.&#160;Hunting is banned in Mexico.&#160;Population-level threats exist in only a few isolated places, and relate mainly to habitat fragmentation and conflicts between bears and people. Many management agencies are more concerned with controlling population growth of this species through legal harvest than promoting further growth and geographic expansion (which could increase human–bear conflicts).</p>","<p>American black bears are primarily a species of temperate and boreal forests, but they also range into subtropical areas of Florida and Mexico as well as into the subarctic. They live at elevations ranging from sea level to 3,500 m, and inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican deserts and scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the grizzly bear; Veitch and Harrington 1996).&#160; Between these extremes they occupy assorted deciduous and coniferous forest types, each providing a different array of foods.<br/> <br/> The American black bear is a generalist, opportunist omnivore. Depending on location and season, they consume herbaceous vegetation, roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion.&#160; Moreover, they readily consume various human-related foods, from garbage and birdseed to a variety of agricultural products from cropfields and orchards, including corn, oats, soybeans, sunflowers, wheat, and apples, and brood and honey in apiaries.&#160; Black bear predation upon livestock has also been documented in some areas. The ability of black bears to adjust their diet to the circumstances has enabled them to persist not only in a diversity of habitat types, but also in highly fragmented forested areas in proximity to humans (Pelton 2003, Benson and Chamberlain 2006, Ditmer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> A key habitat feature in many areas is a source of fall mast that enables black bears to increase their fat reserves for winter hibernation.&#160; Historically, American chestnuts (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) likely were a key fall food for bears (and other wildlife) in eastern North America, but after a blight eliminated this food source in the early and mid-1900s, oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.) acorns and beechnuts (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) have become the principal fall foods for bears throughout this region (Vaughan 2002).&#160; However, oaks are now declining in eastern North America due to forestry practices, insects, disease, and over-abundance of deer (McShea <em>et al. </em>2007), and a disease accidentally introduced in the late 1800s is now spreading widely across beech forests in northeastern U.S. (Morin <em>et al. </em>2007). In parts of the range where oaks and beech are absent or uncommon, hazelnuts (<em>Corylus</em> spp.), whitebark pine nuts (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>), saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) berries, madrone (<em>Arbutus xalapensis</em>), manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos</em> spp.), huckleberries (<em>Vaccinium </em>spp.), buffaloberries (<em>Shepherdia canadensis</em>), wild cherries (<em>Prunus </em>sp.), mountain ash (<em>Sorbus </em>spp.), or other fruits, or sometimes meat, are the fall dietary mainstays.&#160; In the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, succulents such as yucca (<em>Yucca</em> spp.) and cactus fruits also play important roles in providing food, especially during drought (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160; American black bears may migrate considerable distances (up to 200 km) to find more abundant food sources, especially in late summer and fall, prior to hibernation (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Beck 1991, Hellgren <em>et al. </em>2005, Noyce and Garshelis 2011).<br/> <br/> American black bears hibernate for up to 7 months in the northern portions of their range (Bertram and Vivion 2002, Chaulk <em>et al. </em>2005), but for considerably shorter periods in more southerly areas (Wooding and Hardisky 1992, Waller <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; In some southern and low-elevation areas, where food is available year-round, some bears may remain active during winter (Hellgren and Vaughan 1987, Graber 1990, Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Hightower <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; However, all parturient females den to give birth to cubs, typically in January–February.&#160; American black bears use a wide variety of den structures: existing caves or tree cavities, underground chambers that they excavate, root masses, brush piles, or even above-ground nests. Adequate denning sites or structures are rarely thought to be limiting, except in habitats that flood (because young cubs may drown or die of exposure; White <em>et al.</em> 2001), or where bears preferentially choose certain types of dens, such as hollow trees, that are being reduced through logging (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Mating typically occurs in May–July, but may be extended in southern latitudes (Garshelis and Hellgren 1994, Spady <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Females can have as many as 3 estrous cycles (B. Durrant, personal communication, 2014). Implantation is delayed, and active gestation is only 2 months.&#160; Females give birth beginning at age 3–10 years: their rate of growth and maturity varies with food availability, and hence tends to be especially delayed in northern boreal forests.&#160; They can produce cubs every other year, but in places with less food, this interval may be extended to 3 years.&#160; Average litter size is approximately 2.5 cubs in eastern (ranging up to 5 or rarely 6 cubs) versus &lt;2.0 cubs in western North America (Alt 1989, Garshelis 1994, Bridges <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160; Reproductive rate in this species is highest among the ursids, although there is a clear dichotomy between Eastern (including Midwestern) and Western populations.</p>","<p>Throughout most of its range, this species is not threatened.&#160;Legal sport hunting is well controlled by state and provincial agencies to fit management objectives, and most states and provinces that harvest bears have a management plan (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;American black bears are harvested as a game species in all 12 Canadian provinces and territories where they exist and in 31 U.S. states.&#160;Since the early 2000s, 6 states with increasing bear populations opened bear hunting seasons ― Florida, New Jersey and Maryland, after 21-, 33- and 51-year closures, respectively, and Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Nevada for the first time in their management history. The sport harvest for this species in Canada and the U.S. totals 40,000–50,000 annually.&#160;Currently, black bears are not legally hunted in Mexico, but some conditional permits are allowed for depredation cases.<br/> <br/> A few small, isolated populations of American black bears may be threatened with extirpation, simply due to small population size, effects of fluctuating food (and in some cases water) resources, or direct human-caused mortality.&#160;A very small (&lt;20 black bears), isolated population in western Florida may persist only if tenuous travel corridors to other, more robust populations are made safer for bears (Larkin <em>et al. </em>2004). An isolated population on a peninsula in Ontario was judged to have a high probability of extirpation unless all non-natural mortality was eliminated (Howe <em>et al. </em>2007). A black bear population on a large island in Québec was extirpated apparently from introduced deer excessively browsing berry-producing shrubs, and thus eliminating an essential food supply for the resident bears (Côté 2005).<br/> <br/> Most small, isolated populations are in the southern U.S. In a particularly dramatic case, a severe drought in 2000 prompted a number of bears from Big Bend National Park, an isolated population in southwestern Texas, to travel to Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, apparently in search of better fall mast — most never returned (they either remained in Mexico, died naturally when crossing the desert, or were killed by people).&#160;As a result, the entire Big Bend population was reduced to 5–7 bears, including only 2 adult females (Hellgren et al. 2005).&#160;However, since that time, this population has rebounded to higher numbers than were there before the exodus in 2000, likely supplemented by bears immigrating from Mexico. Mexico served as the original source of the recolonization of bears in southwest Texas after they had been eradicated during the 1940s (Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Movements by bears across the seemingly harsh, xeric environment of southwestern U.S. and Mexico once appeared to be anomalous (Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Onorato <em>et al. </em>2004), but it is now recognized as an integral part of the ecology of bears in this region.&#160; In 2011, northern Mexico experienced record drought and wildfires that not only caused high direct bear mortality, but also prompted immigration of bears of both sexes into unburned, previously unoccupied habitat in both Mexico and Texas.<br/> <br/> Increased public awareness of bears and protection from human-caused mortality are likely enabling bears to successfully traverse areas of Mexico where they once would have been persecuted.&#160; Additionally, reports of bears using deer feeders on game ranches in northern Mexico and south Texas have become commonplace, and may be playing a role in promoting bear movements and population growth.&#160; Conversely, recently constructed barriers and human activity spurred by illegal human immigration and drug-related violence could thwart the natural interchange of bears across the U.S.–Mexican border (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/> <br/> Conflicts with humans have been a threat to black bears since European colonization of North America (Cardoza 1976). Human–bear conflict stems from humans and bears competing for space and bears being attracted to food items produced or managed by people. Due to their generalist food habits, black bears are readily attracted to many human sources of foods, such as garbage, agricultural crops, apiaries, and sometimes livestock, especially when their preferred wild foods are scarce. People kill bears in retribution, to prevent property damage, or in fear for their safety.&#160; Encounters between black bears and people have increased as people have encroached upon bear habitat, and as bear populations have increased and expanded into areas occupied by people.&#160; Most states and provinces with a significant population of black bears report common or increasing conflicts between bears and people (Hristienko and McDonald 2007, Spencer <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Recent studies suggest that variation in abundance of natural foods tends to be a key driver of human–bear conflict levels (Howe <em>et al. </em>2010, Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urban areas provide attractive sources of anthropogenic food for bears during periods of natural food shortages, but also are a source of increased mortality (Ryan <em>et al. </em>2007, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014). Urban areas are expected to increase across American black bear range in the future (Bierwagen <em>et al. </em>2010), which, coupled with the potential frequent natural food shortages in arid bear habitats as a result of global climate change, may threaten small or isolated bear populations.<br/> <br/> Increasing density of roads, with increasing traffic volume, is another growing threat to American black bears.&#160; Without immigration from an adjacent national forest, bear numbers in a rural residential community in north-central Florida would have declined as a result of increased adult female mortality from vehicle collisions (Hostetler <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; A stretch of highway in North Carolina that was upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane, with increased speed limits and a new alignment, caused increased bear mortalities that negatively affected the nearby population, even though underpasses were made available (van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012). Poor food years tend to spur wide-scale movements of black bears, resulting in increased mortalities from vehicular collisions (Wooding and Maddrey 1994).</p>","<p>Heavily persecuted since European settlement of North America, compounded by loss of forest cover, American black bear populations rapidly declined, and probably reached a nadir in the early 1900s. Greater state and provincial protection for bears enabled populations to slowly recover.&#160; More rapid growth occurred with increasing protective measures since the late 1980s (Williamson 2002).&#160; By 1999, 60% of U.S. and Canadian states and provinces reported increasing populations, and other jurisdictions appeared to be either stable or fluctuating with no clear trend (Garshelis and Hristienko 2006).&#160; Many of these trend assessments, though, were not derived from serial estimates of population size.<br/> <br/> Based on sums of estimates for individual states, the total U.S. population, excluding Alaska, is estimated at somewhat greater than 300,000.&#160; No reliable estimate exists for numbers of black bears in Alaska, although authorities presume there to be 100,000–200,000 animals.&#160; Similarly, large populations in most parts of Canada are not reliably known, but countrywide estimates center around 450,000 (principally in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec).&#160;Thus, the total number of black bears in North America is likely within the range 850,000–950,000.&#160; No population estimates exist for the country of Mexico, although some areas within Mexico have high and increasing black bear densities (SEMARNAP 1999, Doan-Crider 2003).<br/> <br/> Many population size or density estimates have been derived using rigorous mark–recapture approaches.&#160;Densities have been reported as high as 155 independent black bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (on an Alaskan island with legal hunting and abundant natural foods; Peacock <em>et al. </em>2011) and 214 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (coastal North Carolina with abundant agricultural crops consumed by bears; van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012) to as low as 5 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (interior Alaska; Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997; and pine forest with little food or cover in coastal South Carolina; Drewry <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Some mark–recapture population estimates have been conducted over large geographic areas, encompassing whole states or provinces or numerous study sites across the state or province (e.g., Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ontario: Garshelis and Visser 1997, Garshelis and Noyce 2006, Dreher <em>et al.</em> 2007, Belant <em>et al. </em>2011, Howe <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lackey <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Population trend information is also commonly derived from mark–recapture or from population reconstruction or modelling using ages of legally-harvested bears (Fieberg et al. 2010).&#160; Population size and trend information are routinely used by management agencies to regulate harvest pressure and inform trends in human–bear conflicts.&#160; Detailed demographic studies have revealed that survival and recruitment of American black bears is closely tied to year-to-year variation in natural food abundance (Costello <em>et al. </em>2003, Reynolds-Hogland <em>et al. </em>2007, Obbard and Howe 2008, McCall <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Once portrayed as having one of the lowest rates of reproduction of any land mammal in North America, American black bears in some parts of the range, especially in the East and Midwest, are now known to have higher reproductive rates than previously reported (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160; With controls on human-caused mortality, populations can increase rapidly, and spread through immigration. A black bear population in interior Alaska that was almost entirely removed to reduce predation on moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) completely recovered in 4–6 years by immigration (of both sexes) from the surrounding landscape (Keech <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>",Increasing,"<p>American black bears range across three countries: 12 provinces and territories of Canada (all except Prince Edward Island, where they were once abundant, but the last known one shot in 1927; Sobey 2007); 41 U.S. states (with sightings but undefined ranges in 5 other states); and 6 states of northern Mexico (Scheick and McCown 2014) (with sightings in 4 other Mexican states and a recent record of a dead bear farther south in the state of Hidalgo; Rojas-Martínez and Juárez-Casillas 2013). The species never existed outside of these three countries, although the southern historic limit is not well known. The present range falls within 69°29´ to 23°14´ N (with the incidental record in Hidalgo at 21°05’30” N) and 52°49´ to 164°10´W.<br/> <br/> In western parts of their range, American black bears broadly overlap and compete with grizzly/brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) (Mattson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013). Black bears occupy several islands off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia, but do not coexist with brown bears on any islands.&#160; Northward, black bears narrowly overlap with polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) along the Québec coast of Ungava peninsula, the Ontario and Québec coasts of James Bay, and along the Ontario and Manitoba coasts of Hudson Bay.&#160; Climate change seems to have enabled black bears to range farther north. For example, there have been recent sightings of black bears near Salluit, the second northernmost Inuit community in Québec (62°12'N) (S. Côté, Laval University, Québec City, personal communication, 2015).&#160; Along the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut, local hunters from the community of Arviat (61°5'N) have observed black bears about 50 km west of the village.&#160; These sightings have occurred since 2005, were of single individuals, and are considered to be rare (D. Lee, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, personal communication, 2014) but are farther north than similarly rare excursions noted by Jonkel and Miller (1970).<br/> <br/> Loss of habitat and unregulated hunting/persecution resulted in extirpation of black bears across large portions of their range by the early 1900s.&#160; Present occupied range covers 10.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, representing 65–75% of the historical range, depending on whether Midwestern prairies are counted as historical range (Scheick and McCown 2014). &#160;Black bears were documented along some wooded river courses through the Great Plains (e.g., Lewis and Clark expedition, 1804–1806; Laliberte and Ripple 2003), but were likely scarce in the grasslands. More of the original distribution remains in Canada (&gt;95%; 6.9 million km<sup>2</sup>) than the U.S. (45–60%; 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup>). However, recolonization from growing neighboring populations, in some cases assisted by translocations, have occurred across the U.S., including several previously extirpated states: Rhode Island and Connecticut in the Northeast (Cardoza 1976, Scheick and McCown 2014), Kentucky in the Southeast (Unger <em>et al</em>. 2013), Ohio, Oklahoma and Missouri in the Midwest (Bales <em>et al</em>. 2005, Scheick and McCown 2014, Wilton <em>et al</em>. 2014; although genetic studies suggest that Missouri bears may not have been completely extirpated ― Faries et al. 2013, Puckett <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Texas (Onorato and Hellgren 2001) and Nevada in the Southwest (including areas that were erroneously thought to be outside historic range; Lackey<em> et al</em>. 2013). The current distribution in Mexico (at least 99,000 km<sup>2</sup>) is believed to have been drastically reduced from an unknown historical extent due to deforestation, hunting, and incidental killing from predator poisoning (Delfín-Alfonso <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, these bears are also now expanding and reoccupying portions of their former range, and possibly new areas because of artificial water and food sources.</p>","<p>A looming concern, but not a widespread problem in North America, is the poaching of bears for their paws and gall bladders, which may be sold commercially. Those products, particularly bile from gall bladders, are highly valued by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine.&#160; Several U.S. states and Canadian provinces allow the sale of bear parts taken legally by hunters, either within that jurisdiction or transported into that jurisdiction from elsewhere (Williamson 2002). An argument can be made that this creates opportunities for poachers to employ an illicit pathway into the legal, commercial trade. However, illegal trade appears to be very limited.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>n the U.S. and Canada, black bears are managed by individual states and provinces, so although an IUCN conservation action plan exists for this species (Pelton et al. 1999), each state and province sets their own goals and methods for achieving those goals.&#160; As a whole, this has worked well to re-establish robust populations of black bears across their range. Several key factors aided the rapid rebound of American black bears since the 1980s: (1) improved habitat, (2) large dispersal distances in high-quality habitat (Moore et al. 2014), (3) relatively high reproductive rates, (4) reduced human-caused mortality, and (5) better information about the biology and ecology of bears combined with better population monitoring techniques (Miller 1990).<br/> <br/> Much forested habitat, essential for black bears, was cleared indiscriminately for agriculture during the 1700s–mid-1900s, but has since returned in many parts of the U.S. Most notably, northeastern U.S. (New England) has been naturally reforested back to near its pre-colonial extent (~400 years ago; Hall <em>et al. </em>2002), although tree composition is different (fewer hard mast-producing trees as food for bears; Thompson <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Some states and provinces also manage habitat to benefit bears (e.g., space, foods, travelways, den sites; Pelton <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/> <br/> Through the 1800s and early 1900s in some areas, black bears were extensively hunted for meat, skins, and grease (i.e., market hunting; Smith <em>et al. </em>1991, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013) or hunted or poisoned with the intent of eliminating or severely reducing their numbers to reduce damage to crops and livestock (Cardoza 1976, Raybourne 1987).&#160; Governments often paid a bounty to encourage the killing of black bears.&#160; Protection and recovery occurred state-by-state and province-by-province during 1902–1983 as laws were changed and bears gained protection as a big game species (Miller 1990).&#160;Thereafter, the number and sex of bears killed were more closely controlled through hunting regulations and restrictions on numbers of hunters.&#160; By the 1980s, under the belief that black bears reproduced slowly and were easily over-harvested, most management agencies took a conservative approach to black bear hunting to enable populations to increase (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;Moreover, an infrastructure of wildlife management agency personnel and hunters policed illegal take.<br/> <br/> Wildlife management agencies have also taken an increasingly active role in reducing the number of bears killed in conflict situations through stricter laws against shooting and feeding (in some jurisdictions, feeding bears is illegal), and educational programs aimed at coexisting with bears by reducing attractants, promoting public tolerance, and recognizing that black bears are typically not a threat to human safety (Treves <em>et al. </em>2009, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> In Mexico all hunting seasons for American black bears have been closed since 1985, and the species is considered nationally endangered.&#160;Numerous conservation initiatives established by large private ranches and land cooperatives in northern Mexico have created large blocks of suitable habitat (e.g., oak-dominated forests) with protection from poaching (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160;Changing public attitudes toward bears in Mexico have also contributed to the recovery and expansion of the species (SEMARNAP 1999, Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Although bear populations are clearly increasing, population estimation and monitoring efforts are lacking because funding (normally associated with hunting fees in the U.S. and Canada) is not available.&#160;Hunting bans will likely not be lifted without better documentation of population size and trend.<br/> <br/> In the southeastern U.S., where black bears now occupy 27–37% of their historic range (depending on whether primary range or total bear range are counted as occupied range; Scheick and McCown 2014), population recovery was aided by the establishment of national parks and other sanctuaries in the Appalachian Mountains and the Coastal Plain (Pelton and van Manen 1997).&#160;These large areas protect the habitat (especially mast-producing trees) and restrict hunter access.&#160;Beginning in the early 1970s, additional areas were established where bear hunting was prohibited, thus linking protected areas to other forested lands, including many private lands.&#160;the resulting conglomerates serve as dedicated or defacto sanctuaries, especially for adult females, that are a source for bears expanding into other areas (Beringer <em>et al. </em>1998, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> In some areas, populations of American black bears have either been augmented or reintroduced after former extirpation by transplanting bears from elsewhere (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; Reintroductions into Arkansas during the 1960s were highly successful (Smith <em>et al. </em>1991).&#160; Licensed hunters in this state now harvest several hundred bears annually, and bears from Arkansas have expanded into neighboring states. Further reintroductions within Arkansas have been conducted more recently (Wear <em>et al. </em>2005). A successful reintroduction augmented a newly-spawning population in Kentucky (Unger <em>et al. </em>2013). Augmentation of several populations in Louisiana during the mid-1960s likely contributed to population recovery there.<br/> <br/> The Louisiana black bear (<em>U. a. luteolus</em>), a recognized subspecies of American black bear, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1992 as a result of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality (Bowker and Jacobson 1995).&#160;At the time of the listing, and since then, the validity and integrity of this subspecies has been debated (Pelton 1991, Kennedy <em>et al</em>. 2002, Csiki <em>et al. </em>2003, Puckett <em>et al. </em>2015). Under this ruling, all bears within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear, from east Texas to southern Mississippi, have been protected.&#160;Much of the bottomland hardwood forest that the Louisiana black bear historically inhabited had been converted to agriculture.&#160;Since 1992, remnant bottomland hardwoods have been protected, and some marginal farmland converted to hardwood trees.&#160; Moreover, a new population of bears within Louisiana was established by translocating bears from other Louisiana populations (Benson and Chamberlain 2007) in order to create a stepping-stone between two separated populations; this enabled bears to travel between them (Laufenberg and Clark 2014).&#160;One irony is that the stepping-stone successfully linked a population that was believed to be native Louisiana black bears with a population that had previously been established by translocating <em>U. a. americanus</em> bears from Minnesota (1964–1967). The Minnesota bears had clearly adapted to the very different habitat and weather conditions in Louisiana, as they have been established there for three generations and their numbers have been increasing.&#160;However, if the <em>luteolus</em> subspecies has any merit, the successful establishment of a conservation corridor reduced the purity of that genetic stock.<br/> <br/> The conservation efforts in Louisiana have been further enhanced through public information and education.&#160;This management program is organized by a broad coalition of state and federal agencies, conservation groups, forestry and agricultural industries, and private landowners.&#160;As a result, bears have been noticeably increasing in numbers and distribution in all three range states, although a breeding population does not yet exist in east Texas.&#160; Large, contiguous forested habitat capable of sustaining a population of black bears exists within the historical range of the subspecies in east Texas (Kaminski <em>et al. </em>2013); however, surveys of local people indicate concern over potential conflicts with an established bear population in the area (Morzillo <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the Louisiana black bear, based largely on a rigorous study (Laufenberg and Clark 2014) that showed that all of the population criteria for recovery had been attained and adequate safeguards against future threats were in place (Fuller 2015).<br/> <br/> Another typically-accepted subspecies of black bear (<em>U. a. floridanus</em>) was listed as threatened by the state of Florida in 1974, although legal hunting continued in some population strongholds until 1994.&#160;Habitat degradation, and bears being killed on highways and in conflicts with people are the primary threats to these bears. The fragmented habitat contributes to the high vehicle kills and human interactions. A public petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the Florida black bear as a federally threatened species was denied in 1992.&#160;A black bear management plan, adopted in 1993, directed the state management agency to conserve habitat and reduce human-caused bear mortalities. These efforts, particularly habitat conservation measures and changes in human attitudes toward bears, supported a steady population increase (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;Florida black bears have been expanding into areas of unoccupied habitat as regrowth of understory and forests improve habitat quality, even as development reduces habitat quantity.&#160; In 2010 the status of the Florida black bear was re-evaluated using IUCN redlisting criteria, and after a thorough, peer-reviewed biological assessment and development of a management plan, the species was removed from the state’s threatened species list in 2012 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;A hunt was initiated in 2015.<br/> <br/> In British Columbia much conservation attention has been directed toward the Kermode subspecies <em>(U. a. kermodei</em>).&#160;This animal is commonly referred to as the “spirit bear” because it possesses a gene that when homozygous is manifested as white pelage (Ritland <em>et al. 2</em>001).&#160; White-phased animals have long been protected from hunting.&#160; A large system of protected areas was established in 2006 (Great Bear Rainforest Agreement) to ban or severely restrict logging within &gt;200,000 ha of coastal temperate rainforest inhabited by this subspecies of black bear, as well as by brown bears.&#160; Additionally, the spirit bear was selected as the official provincial mammal of British Columbia.<br/> <br/> Since 1992 all American black bears have been listed in Appendix II of CITES, under the similarity of appearance provision (Article II, para 2b).&#160; This listing stipulates that documentation of legal harvest is necessary for the import and export of body parts in order to prevent these from being confused as parts from illegally obtained bears.&#160; This listing was not designed to protect American black bears, but rather other species of threatened bears, particularly the Asiatic black bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), whose parts might otherwise be sold under the guise of being from American black bear.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
115067136,4007,Castor fiber,Least Concern,,2016,2016-09-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Eurasian Beaver has shown good recovery across much of its range, as a result of conservation programmes. The highest numbers are found within Europe. Conservation measures are ongoing to prevent the population declining again and as long as these continue, there is no reason to continue to assess the species as threatened or Near Threatened. Now Least Concern. However, the Asian populations remain very small and under serious threat, and these populations urgently need conservation measures.","Beavers are adapted for a semi-aquatic life, using a variety of freshwater systems, including rivers, streams, irrigation ditches, lakes, and swamps. They generally prefer freshwater habitats surrounded by woodland, but may occur in agricultural land or even suburban and urban areas (Tattersall 1999, Halley and Rosell 2002). In northern Scandinavia, beavers may be found right up to the limit of the willow zone in the mountains, where knee-high willow bushes are the only woody vegetation and it is iced over for 8 months of the year. This is not preferred habitat, but they can survive there. In many places, beavers live both on the valley floor, and on the mountain plateau above (where it is wooded), with a break in distribution where streams flow down the steep valley sides. In general beavers should be able to live in almost any freshwater habitat where there are trees or shrubs and the gradient is not precipitous. However, patterns of recolonisation demonstrate a clear preference for still or slow, laminar water flow if it is available (Nowak 1999, Halley and Rosell 2002, Halley pers. comm. 2006).","The Eurasian Beaver's historic decline was caused by over-hunting for fur, meat and castoreum (a secretion from the scent glands), combined with loss of wetland habitats. Beaver populations were severely reduced in most countries by mediæval times, but the species clung on in marshes and other inaccessible places until the advent of efficient steel traps and accurate firearms in the 17th century; and then through to the 19th century there was a rash of final extinctions for these reasons combined with drainage of many of the large marshland areas in which the species clung on (all of the European refugia where the species survived, except in Norway, are extensive marshlands). <br/><br/>Today, beaver populations in Europe are expanding rapidly, and there are no major threats (e.g. threats of a magnitude likely to cause decline at the regional level). Competitive exclusion of the native Eurasian Beaver <em>C. fiber</em> by its American cousin <em>C. canadensis</em> may be a threat in parts of Finland and north-west Russia, but it is not a major threat regionally. In Europe North American beavers are now confined entirely to Finland and north-west Russia, where populations are increasing only slowly (due to heavy harvesting). The former population at a reservoir near Paris has been removed, and populations introduced to Poland and Austria have apparently gone extinct in competition with <em>C. fiber</em>, the opposite of what has tended to happen in Finland and north-west Russia (it has been suggested that, due to differences in the life history of the two species, Eurasian beavers may have a competitive advantage at more southerly latitudes, whilst North American beavers may be more successful further north: D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). There are no serious prospects of further introductions (Halley and Rosell 2002, D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). The two species do not interbreed (Tattersall 1999). Road kill is an important source of mortality for some populations (Tattersall 1999). Rapidly expanding beaver populations may come into conflict with humans in some areas, as they do some damage to forestry and crops. Such damages should be put into perspective: they tend to be less severe than those caused by other species such as deer and voles, but are noticed because beavers are a new and unfamiliar species in areas where they have been recently introduced (Halley and Rosell 2002).<br/><br/>In Mongolia, illegal hunting for skins, meat and castoreum still occurs in some areas such as the Tes River. Habitat loss through selective clear-cutting of willow, upon which this species relies for food and shelter is also a threat; this is known to be occurring along the Bulgan River and is leading to isolation of small populations and inbreeding. Pollution of water systems is also a threat. A hydroelectric dam in the Chinese section of the Bulgan River prevents migrations in this area (M. Stubbe pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, firewood gathering has depleted much of the forest on which the beavers need to subsist; additionally heavy grazing pressure has further reduced vegetation needed by beavers.","By the beginning of the 20th century, the global population had been reduced to eight populations, totalling approximately 1,200 individuals (Halley and Rosell 2002). Protection (beginning with a hunting ban implemented in Norway in 1845), natural spread and reintroductions have resulted in a rapid recovery in numbers and range, particularly in Europe. In 1998, the global population was estimated at 430,000 (Nolet and Rosell 1998), by 2002 it had reached at least 593,000 (Halley and Rosell 2002), and in 2006 the minimum estimate was 639,000 (D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). This is almost certainly a considerable underestimate, as both population and range are in rapid expansion (Halley and Rosell 2002, 2003; D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). Considerable further expansion in range and population, especially in western Europe and the lower Danube basin, can be expected. If current trends continue, the Eurasian Beaver will be a fairly common mammal in much of Europe within the next few decades.<br/><br/>However, populations in Asia are still considered small. In Mongolia, reintroductions have been successful and the population has reached 150, and in China the population is about 700 (Halley and Rosell 2002, EMA Workshop 2006, Smith and Xie in press).<br/><br/>In Mongolia in 1964, the population size was estimated to consist of 100-150 individuals (Stubbe and Chotolchu, 1968), rising to 200 individuals by 1973 (Zevegmid and Dawaa, 1973). In 1991, surveys estimated there to be approximately 300 individuals along Bulgan and Hovd rivers (Stubbe <em>et al.</em>, 1991). The most recent population assessment was conducted in 2004, which recorded 40 lodges along Hovd River and estimated the population to consist of 130-150 individuals (Shar, 2005). Ten beaver settlements were recorded in the Tuvan section of Tes River in 2005 (A. Saveljev pers. comm.), and the Mongolian section of this river is believed to contain a similar beaver population (M. Stubbe pers. comm).<br/><br/>The Chinese subspecies of the Eurasian Beaver (<em>C. f. birulai</em>) is one of the rarest and least known aquatic mammals in China.  In the 1970s it was believed that only 100 animals remained in fewer than 20 family groups.  Currently, only one substantial population is known, at the Buergan River Beaver Reserve along the Xinjiang-Mongolian border - a narrow strip 50 km long and only 500 m wide.  Here the population is estimated to be only 500 animals, and only 700 may live in all of China.",Increasing,"The Eurasian beaver <em>Castor fiber</em> was once widespread in Europe and Asia. However, by the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, over-hunting had drastically reduced both the numbers and range of the species. In Europe, only a few isolated sites remained: parts of the Rhone (France) and Elbe (Germany), southern Norway, the Neman River and Dnepr Basin (Belarus) and Voronezh (Russia). A series of management measures and reintroductions have enabled the beaver to return to much of its former range, and there are now a number of rapidly expanding populations extending from Spain and France across central and eastern Europe to European Russia, and in Scandinavia and parts of western Finland.<br/><br/>Free-living populations of beavers are now established or establishing in most regions of their former European range, the main exceptions to date being Portugal, Italy, the south Balkans and Great Britain (Halley and Rosell 2002, Ceña <em>et al.</em> 2004). Detailed information on the status and distribution of the Eurasian beaver in each range state can be found in Halley and Rosell (2002), and information on the population that was translocated to Spain in 2003 can be found in Ceña <em>et al.</em> (2004). It is generally a lowland species, but occurs up to 850 m in Europe (Halley pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>In Mongolia, a small population exists along the Bulgan River in northern Dzungarian Govi Desert, in the south-western corner of Mongolia. Mongolian-German Biological Expeditions carried out conservation introductions along Hovd River in Mongol Altai Mountain Range in 1974, 1975, and 1978, and along Tes River in northern Hangai Mountain Range in 1985, 1988 and 2002. In all cases Mongolian beavers from the Bulgan River were used in order to protect the gene pool in the central Asiatic hydro-geographic basin (Stubbe and Dawaa, 1982; Stubbe <em>et al.</em>, 2005a). A separate attempt to reintroduce beavers from Voronezh Reserve (Russian Federation) was unsuccessful (M. Stubbe pers. comm).",It is hunted for food and clothing.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"A number of conservation measures have contributed to the species' recovery in Europe, including reintroductions and translocations, hunting restrictions, and habitat protection. It is listed under the Bern Convention (Appendix III) and the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex V for the Swedish and Finnish populations, Annex II and IV for all others). In Finland, <em>C. canadensis</em> populations are controlled to prevent them spreading into the west where <em>C. fiber</em> occurs. Halley and Rosell (2002) recommend regulated hunting as the optimal management regime in managed landscapes with healthy beaver populations. Management of beaver populations should be at the watershed scale, except where large human-made dams form significant barriers to spread. Early provision of interpretation and public viewing opportunities is also recommended, as this provides a benefit to the local economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to beavers (Halley and Rosell 2002). This has been a successful feature of several recent reintroductions. Reintroduction to Italy has been recommended in a European Union/Bern Convention Nature and Environment Series document (Nolet 1996). Considerable efforts have been made to develop a beaver reintroduction programme in Scotland, and a full public consultation showed strong support for such a scheme among the general public, including in rural areas where beavers were likely to be released (Halley and Rosell 2002).<br/><br/>In Mongolia, <em>C. f. birulai</em> is protected as Very Rare under part 7.1 of the Law of the Mongolian Animal Kingdom (2000), and is included as Rare in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books (Shagdarsuren <em>et al.</em>, 1987; MNE, 1997). This subspecies is also listed as Very Rare under the 1995 Mongolian Hunting Law (MNE, 1996). Approximately 11% of the species’ range in Mongolia occurs within protected areas.<br/><br/>Conservation measures in place in Mongolia:<br/><br/>1) Bulgan Gol Nature Reserve was established along the Bulgan River in 1965 to conserve this species.<br/><br/>2) Many translocations and conservation introductions have taken place over the past 50 years to enhance the Mongolian population.<br/><br/>The species is considered Endangered (EN A1bcd) in the Chinese Red List.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

These subpopulations approximately totalled an estimated 7,500 Lions in 2014 and comprise a substantial portion of the total species population, so that we feel confident in applying observed trends to the species as a whole as well as on a regional basis.<br/><br/>The overall classification of the Lion as Vulnerable masks a dichotomy: we observe that sample Lion subpopulations increased by 12% in four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in India, while an observed decline of 60% in sample subpopulations outside these countries is inferred for the remainder of its African range. In other words, in the majority of its range the Lion meets the A2 criterion for Endangered with the inferred rate of decline over 50% in three generations, but this trend is numerically mitigated by a small number of subpopulations in a restricted geographical range.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is reflected in listings of the species in different Red Lists: in South Africa, the Lion will be categorized as Least Concern on the national Red List in preparation (Child <em>et al</em>. In prep.), whereas in India it is Endangered (as subspecies <em>P. l. persica</em> on the global IUCN Red List: Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2008) and in the region of West Africa meets the criteria for Critically Endangered (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015).&#160; The range state list in Table 1 (attached Supporting Material) further illustrates the high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, as Lions have been recently extirpated in 12 African countries and we suspect possible recent extirpation in another four.<br/><br/>Among the causes of decline, the most important are indiscriminate killing in defence of human life and livestock, habitat loss, and prey base depletion. Prey base depletion is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al</em>. 2013). An emerging threat is trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (IUCN 2006a, b; Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, although trophy hunting contributes positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices have been recommended (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2013, Edwards<em> et al</em>. 2014), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Croes <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). While attention is currently focused on Lion hunting reforms to ensure sustainability, the leading causes of population decline are more difficult to address and are likely to continue. The observed and inferred reductions are based on direct observation; appropriate indices of abundance; declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality; and actual and potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in southern Africa. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is properly funded; fencing is one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets are low, leading to local decline and even extinction, for example in West Africa (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160; Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic and South Sudan, but we fear drastic declines especially for the latter two.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we assess the Lion as Vulnerable based on criterion A, more specifically A2abcd. Lion range and abundance exceed the Vulnerable thresholds for criteria B, C and D, respectively, so these criteria do not contribute to the present assessment, whilst criterion E was not applied. Vulnerable A2abcd is the same listing as the previous assessment but with a different underlying method. Previous assessments were based on a suspected decline of the total estimated number of Lions, which necessarily included low quality data. In the present assessment we did not use total Lion estimates, because we had a better alternative. We now have enough good quality data for a representative sub-set of Lion subpopulations to calculate an observed decline, from which we infer a decline for the species as a whole.<br/><p>  </p>","The Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer 2013). Although Lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but Lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills.<br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting. Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266-4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001).<br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic Lion is dry deciduous forest. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al</em>. 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic Lion's diet, although the most common prey is the Chital Deer. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","<p>The main threats to Lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock) and prey base depletion. Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hazzah <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol <em>et al</em>. 1985, Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Loveridge <em>et al</em>. 2007, Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunter<em> et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>Disease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Trinkel <em>et al</em>. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).<br/></p>","<p><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>This assessment is based on a time trend analysis of census data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013, plus additional unpublished data provided by contributors). Census estimates were obtained by scientific research methods including total count, individual identifications, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photo databases, spoor counts and density estimates based on direct observations corrected for patrol effort.&#160;These methods are rated as producing the most reliable type of Lion population estimates by background papers for the 2006 IUCN regional Lion workshops (Table 5 in Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b).&#160;We did not include population estimates for sites which were based on extrapolation of Lion densities obtained by research in other areas, or informed guesstimates by researchers. The minimum number of census surveys per site over the assessment time period is two, but some sites have been more regularly monitored (Table 3 - Data Points column, in Supplementary Material).&#160;In some cases census methodology varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em>et al</em>. (2013):</p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR</p><p>Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; R<sub>span</sub> = 15.5 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 12 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013)</p><p>Thus GL = 12*0.29 +3.5 = 6.98 yrs<br/><br/>To fill gaps between censuses conducted in non-consecutive years, we interpolated population sizes, assuming a linear change between years. For surveys conducted for only a few years between 1993 and 2014, we extrapolated to the beginning and end points based on an exponential rate of change taken from the observed growth rate for each respective subpopulation. However, all extrapolations are capped by the estimated carrying capacity for each reserve so that subpopulations that experienced dramatic population change were not assumed to have been at implausibly high totals in either 1993 or 2014. Subpopulations were first categorized according to whether or not the reserves were surrounded by a fence; unfenced subpopulations were further categorized according to geographical location with the exception of Niassa Reserve (Mozambique), treated as an outlier as discussed below.<br/><br/>In graph form (Figures 1-4 in the Supplementary Material) we summarize the repeated censuses of 46 different African Lion subpopulations using all available repeat-survey data. Figure 5 (in the Supplementary Material) addresses the 47th Lion subpopulation in our analysis, the only Asian subpopulation.<br/><br/>Outside parts of southern Africa, Lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62% between 1993 and 2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).&#160; Although these totals only included about 4,600 Lions in the year 1993, several surveyed areas are restricted to the best-protected portions of much larger ecosystems (e.g., the phototourism areas of Selous and Serengeti).<br/><br/>In contrast, the total number of Lions in six unfenced reserves in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe only declined by about 11% (Figure 2, Supplementary Material). Note that the overall stability in southern Africa masks considerable heterogeneity: between 1993 and 2014 the monitored Lion subpopulation in a portion of the Okavango ecosystem is estimated to have declined by 46%, whereas the much smaller subpopulations in Gonarezhou and Kunene have increased dramatically.<br/><br/>The striking contrast between these three countries in southern Africa and the rest of the continent is probably related to the equally striking differences in human population densities (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013) in Namibia (2.5/km²), Botswana (3.4) and Zimbabwe (26) vs. Benin (78), Burkina Faso (57), Cameroon (40), Cote d’Ivoire (64), Ghana (102), Kenya (67), Nigeria (189), Rwanda (420), Senegal (68), Tanzania (48), Uganda (137) and Zambia (45).<br/><br/>The unfenced Niassa subpopulation is estimated to have increased by over 250% since 1993 (Figure 3, Supplementary Material); despite severe bushmeat poaching the Lions are still recovering from excessive prey depletion during civil war. In addition, on a shorter time scale, Lions have benefited from extensive ivory poaching, which has provided them with sizeable quantities of elephant meat (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2014). Human population density in Mozambique is 74/km² with sizeable numbers of people living inside Niassa Reserve, so unless management is further strengthened, this unfenced Lion subpopulation may soon experience declining food supplies and increased human-lion conflicts. These arguments strongly suggest that the ‘boom’ in the Niassa Lion subpopulation has stopped and is unlikely to be repeated in the future. We therefore consider Niassa to be a special case and treat it as an outlier in our analyses, we believe that this offers a better understanding of trends, but we note that this does not alter the assessment (with Niassa included, the assessment would still be Vulnerable A2abcd).<br/><br/>The 16 fenced African subpopulations (10 in South Africa, and all but one in southern Africa) have grown by 29% since 1993, most having already reached their presumed carrying capacities by 2013 (Figure 4, Supplementary Material). Note that although these numbers now total over 3,226 lions, our data come from the great majority of fenced reserves in Africa and that little further growth can be expected in these subpopulations.<br/><br/>Asia is home to a single contiguous subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat (Figure 5, Supplementary Material). While the population has stabilized inside the Gir Reserve, the so-called “satellite” population in the surrounding countryside has expanded by ~400% in the past 21 years.<br/><br/>The 47 sample Lion subpopulations totalled an estimated 9,615 lions in 1993 (excluding Niassa, which is treated as an outlier as described above); that number shrank by 22% to 7,455 lions in 2014 (Table 2, Supplementary Material).&#160; However, as described above, there are significant regional differences evident in population trend, and we use these to inform our inferences about population trend for the species as a whole. Table 2 (Supplementary Material) groups the sample subpopulations by region in Africa, following the IUCN (2006a, b) regional Lion conservation strategies, but combining West and Central Africa due to a small sample size for Central Africa.&#160; In Southern Africa, the sample population grew by 8%, while in sharp contrast, sample populations declined by 59% in Eastern Africa and 66% in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Table 3 (Supplementary Material) shows the estimated Lion population size in 1993 and 2014 for each of the 47 sample subpopulations with percentage change, and it can be seen that most countries had a declining trend for sample Lion subpopulations, with only four countries (India, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) seeing a growth trend. Table 4 (Supplementary Material) groups these countries with Botswana, which had a relatively low average rate of decline for its sample populations; two out of three sample subpopulations increased; the decline documented in the Okavango subpopulation was restricted to only part of the protected area; and overall 2012 estimates for the national population suggest that it his increased since 2003 (C. Winterbach unpubl. data). Mozambique is not included in this group as the increasing trend in its Niassa subpopulation is treated as an outlier in this analysis. The sample Lion population in five countries (Botswana, India, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) grew by an estimated 12%, whereas the Lion population in the remaining African range countries declined by an estimated 61% (Table 4, Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We infer population trend for the total Lion species population based on these two rates of change, as follows. In 2002, two separate country compilations of population estimates for Lions in Africa estimated the number of Lions in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to comprise between 1/4 to 1/3 of the total African Lion population, as shown in Table 5 (Supplementary Material). We suspect that this proportion was somewhat lower in 1993, given that the number of Lions is inferred to have increased in these countries while decreasing in the remainder, and use a figure of 1/4 or 25% for our species population trend calculation. If 25% of the Lion population increased by 12%, and 75% decreased by 60%, this results in an inferred trend of (0.75*-60%) + (0.25*12%) = -43% between 1993 and 2014 (Table 6, Supplementary Material).</p><br/>This qualifies the Lion as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that the vast majority of the population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the criteria for Endangered. Since our sample subpopulations were all monitored, we suspect an even greater average rate of decline for unmonitored unfenced subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort.<br/><br/><strong>Abundance</strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers, we present no new data. A recent paper summarized and updated efforts to estimate the population size of the African Lion leading to the most recent estimate of 32,000 lions in 67 Lion areas (Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). The paper presents some recent data, but where no new data were available it included unaltered numbers from earlier sources, such as Bauer and Van der Merwe (2004) and Chardonnet (2002). As a consequence, Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) include numbers from 2002 and 2004 for areas where we believe the downward trend described above occurred. We therefore consider these sources to be insufficiently precautionary for our purpose and feel that an assessment on numbers is less robust than our assessment based on trends. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative (see above), we decided not to use total Lion numbers for the present assessment<br/><br/>However, we do attempt to correct for outdated sources in the Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimate by application of the regional trends we found (Table 3, Supplementary Material) to the 2002 population size estimates within the respective regions (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004, Chardonnet 2002). These are two largely independent and reasonably comprehensive sets of estimated numbers that were coherent in time. Rather than presenting these numbers as in any way current, we look at how they might be expected to have changed.&#160;We calculated estimated present Lion numbers per region (Table 7, Supplementary Material) by applying the observed trend over the subsequent 12 years, except that numbers for West Africa were taken from a comprehensive recent survey (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014) because of their greater precision. As a small modification from Chardonnet (2002) we moved the estimate for Selous ecosystem to Eastern Africa to be consistent with the regional divisions used here. The two 2002 estimates were compared in detail (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2005a,b), showing the ALWG study (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004) was more conservative and stricter on data quality. Most notably, Bauer and Van Der Merwe (2004) lacked data for Ruaha and Tarangire which may hold close to 5,000 Lions. With all these considerations, we have greater confidence in an estimate of closer to 20,000 Lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000.<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty&#160;</strong>We do not have sufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates to employ them to estimate trend and for this assessment have used groupings of scientific time series site estimates as a proxy. &#160;Although these data are more numerous for Lions than for other big <em>Panthera </em>cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2015) and our treatment of it to estimate species population trend. Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2014) state that, ""All attitudes (towards uncertainty) should be explicitly documented. &#160;In situations where the spread of plausible values (after excluding extreme or unlikely values) qualifies a taxon for two or more categories of threat, the precautionary approach would recommend that the taxon be listed under the higher (more threatened) category.""&#160;<br/>As noted in Table 2 (see Supplementary Material), if the species trend is inferred directly from the total sample population trend, the result, a decline of 22%, would qualify the species as Near Threatened rather than Vulnerable. However, considering the demonstrated significant regional differences such an approach would be inappropriate.&#160;<br/>We treated Mozambique's Niassa subpopulation trend as an outlier and removed it from our trend analysis for reasons described above, but we also documented the effect of the exclusion. Some contributors proposed a second outlier: Tanzania’s Katavi subpopulation. Katavi has been consistently and repeatedly monitored, but the survey methodology was imprecise (vehicle transects: Caro 2011), this yielded a significant decline rate approaching 100% in a large population of over 1,100 estimated lions in the study site portion of the park in 1993 (Table 3). If Katavi would have been treated as an outlier and excluded from the analysis, inferred rate of decline would be 33%, and the rate of decline for Lions in East Africa would be 37%. Lions are still extant in Katavi (as shown in our map), although well below carrying capacity (Kiffner <em>et al.</em> 2008). Rather than using an arbitrary low value, we used the value documented by surveys (zero); Lions are extant but at a density so low as not to be detected. While the methodology is imprecise, it has proved reliable for carnivore monitoring in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al</em>. 2011). Furthermore, the extent of decline may have been measured with lack of precision, but population decline remains uncontested. Since it is one of only two long-term monitoring programmes in Tanzania (Caro 2011) we decided that it was important to include these data and decided that there was insufficient ground to treat it as an outlier.<br/>Another uncertainty that needs to be documented is our treatment of small fenced reserves in southern Africa. Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where intensive management practices include translocations, stocking, contraception and euthanasia. Such management is atypical, and as pointed out by Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) the Red List Guidelines are ambiguous as to the inclusion or exclusion of fenced areas. Their exclusion from the analysis would raise the inferred Lion decline rate to 49%. Following through on our supposition that unmonitored Lion populations have undergone an even higher rate than our monitored sample, this could potentially have been interpreted as a suspected rate of decline over 50%, qualifying the Lion as Endangered. However, we did not exclude fenced populations from our assessment. Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) state that such decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific. We consider that management of Lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes, aims to retain adaptive potential and follows a meta-population management approach. We further consider that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer<em> et al</em>. 2013). We find this sufficient justification for inclusion of these reserves.<br/>National estimated rates of population change are most meaningful in practice, and these are given in Table 3 in the Supplementary Material. &#160;We did not use national rates to gauge species decline, as the sample sizes are generally small and estimates of national Lion populations imprecise.",Decreasing,"Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from Northern Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lions are found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The last assessment of extant Lion range is provided by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013); they identified 67 Lion areas comprising 3.4 million km², which is 17% of historical range or about 25% of savanna Africa. We took those layers as a starting point, but made a few modifications to reflect the cautionary approach used by the IUCN Red List. Like with population numbers (see Population section), Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) copied old layers in the absence of new information. <em>De facto</em>, this means that large swathes of land are classified as Lion range based on the group exercises led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; they found 86 Lion Conservation Units (LCUs) covering 4.6 million km² or 22% of historical range (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008). Henschel <em>et al</em>. (2010, 2014) found that many of these LCUs in West and Central Africa no longer contained Lions, and the range map was adapted accordingly for this assessment. Similarly, the survey and mapping unit at Panthera conducted further range updates based on new survey results and other properly documented information from other regions. Furthermore, some of the mapped LCUs are located in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on lion persistence (e.g. Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof of the contrary, and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as Possibly Extinct but maintained Protected Areas inside them as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as Possibly Extinct could contain relict Lion subpopulations, and should be prioritized for field surveys aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Areas where we consider Lion populations Possibly Extinct total 1,811,087 km², over half (52%) of the range classified as extant by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013). We estimate extant Lion range, areas where we are reasonably confident that lions persist, based on recent records, at 1,654,375 km², or 8% of historical range. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and&#160; the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> in CITES Appendix I. CITES listing of the Lion is currently undergoing a Periodic Review process to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the present situation, with a final recommendation of the Animals Committee expected at its 28th meeting in 2015. The Animals Committee also noted recent information regarding possible changes in the nomenclature of Lions and requests its nomenclature expert to&#160; review this information (CITES AC27 WG8). <br/><br/>In Africa, Lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way Lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for Lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2006). These regional strategies have been used in many countries to develop Lion Conservation Action Plans. While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em></em>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The taxon is subject to population fluctuations due to disease and effects of severe winter conditions. However, several recent authorities agree on a figure of approximately 1,000,000 and the range is expanding towards the north-west. Annual monitoring of the status of this species is required as an upsurge in illegal hunting in conjunction with adverse climatic conditions or outbreak of disease could result in a sharp fall qualifying for a classification of Near Threatened or Vulnerable.","Inhabits rolling arid steppes and grassy plains; in particular feather grass (<em>Stipa </em>spp<em>.)&#160;</em>steppes and sometimes semi-deserts (Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997). Mongolian Gazelles move constantly over their range in search of food, except during the rutting and birthing seasons.","The major threats to this species are disease outbreaks,&#160; illegal hunting, habitat conversion, habitat fragmentation, and severe winters. Illegal hunting (in addition to the legal harvest) is an increasing threat and male-biased hunting before and during the rut could have serious consequences for the fecundity of the population (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).<br/><br/>The Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway is double-fenced and has effectively cut off the smaller western populations from the core population in eastern Mongolia (Ito <em>et al.</em> 2005), although the large population and high mobility of the species has allowed sufficient gene flow (Okada <em>et al.</em> 2015). Outbreaks of disease and severe winters result in sporadic heavy mortality. Increasing livestock numbers has led to an increase in associated disease transmission (e.g. bacterial pneumonia caused by<em> Pasteurella</em>, viral influenza, foot-and-mouth, and anthrax) (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Schaller and Lhagvasuren 1998, Nyamsuren <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;The distribution of Mongolian Gazelle is influenced by the activity of the vole <em>Lasiopodomys brandtii</em>. For example, in the 1990s a large increase in the <em>L. brandtii</em> population destroyed a huge area of pasture in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces and the gazelles disappeared from these areas and moved north (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).","Population estimates over the last 10 years have ranged from 400,000 to 2,700,000. The taxon is subject to population fluctuations due to disease and effects of severe winter conditions.

Most of the current population is found in the eastern Mongolian steppes. Smaller populations are found in central and western Mongolia. Some move south into China in winter where at one time up to 250,000 may occurred. Numbers in China have been greatly reduced by hunting and expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing and it is considered Critically Endangered in the national Red List (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Stable,"<em>Procapra gutturosa</em> occurs in eastern Mongolia and adjacent areas of Russia and north-eastern China. Smaller populations are still found in central and western Mongolia where they were previously abundant (Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004). There is a translocated population on Homin Tal steppe in Zavkhan Province of west-central Mongolia. In the past 50 years, the geographic range of the Mongolian Gazelle has been reduced by about 76%. The vast majority of Mongolian Gazelles are now found in Mongolia itself; and within Mongolia the species is found in large numbers in only four provinces: Dornod, Khentii, Sukhbaatar and Dornogobi (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997) and in smaller numbers in other provinces.","The species is harvested for meat, hides and use of body parts (horn,&#160;liver, heart, lungs, kidneys and fat)&#160;in Asian medicine.&#160;Locally the tanned hides are used to produce chamois and the horns are made into handles for knives and various household articles (Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997). From the horns of young Mongolian Gazelles, the Institute of National Medicine under the Ministry of Public Health of the Mongolian People's Republic produced a drug named 'procaprin', which is said to exert sedative and tonic effects (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997).&#160;Former tight control in Mongolia has weakened during the last decade and tens of thousands (80-85 per cent of which are thought to be males) are killed illegally on top of the official harvest (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997). A hunting survey found that local herders in the eastern steppe region alone take as many as 150,000 gazelles annually (K. Olson, pers. comm. in Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004). Above the total sustainable off-take of 6% a year, or&#160;60,000 gazelles, that&#160;harvest models suggest (Milner-Gulland and Lhagvasuren 1998).&#160;This hunting could be exacerbated if there is a commercial switch from Saiga to Mongolian Gazelle horns, and evidence for this ominous trend has been found in the recent increase in price for gazelle horns (Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Terrestrial,"Occurs in some protected areas in Mongolia but most of the population occurs outside these.

Overall it is very widespread and hence it is currently considered to be Least Concern.","It prefers mature spruce-dominated forests with a significant proportion of deciduous trees, especially aspen <em>Populus tremula</em>, birch <em>Betula </em>sp. and alder <em>Alnus </em>sp. (Reunanen <em>et al.</em> 2000, 2002). Large deciduous trees are an important source of both food and nest-sites: the flying squirrel feeds primarily on alder and birch catkins in the winter and alder leaves in the summer, and nests in old woodpecker holes or natural cavities in decaying wood. They are nocturnal and do not hibernate. They are found from lowlands to montane regions (Abe, <em>et al.</em>, 2005).","Modern intensive forestry and logging are the major threats to this species (Hanski <em>et al.</em> 2001). Large tracts of mature boreal forest have been felled and replaced by a managed forest landscape that is a mosaic of semi-natural forest, young saplings, and clear-cut patches. Fragmentation of forests is a particular problem for this species, as flying squirrels are reluctant to cross open areas on the ground. Managed forests also tend to have fewer deciduous trees (which are an essential winter food source), less decaying wood and fewer tree-holes (which are needed for nest-sites). In parts of Russia, it has been estimated that up to 50% of logging is illegal (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002). Illegal logging is particularly destructive, as unsustainable practices such as high-grading or 'skimming' are used, meaning that for every ten trees felled only one or two high-quality logs will be used (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002). The species is also hunted for commercial use of its fur, but this is not considered a major threat at present (Nowak 1991).<br/><br/>In Mongolia, habitat loss caused by selective logging, human-caused fires and natural wildfires in some parts of its range are a threat.","The species continues to decline in many parts of its range owing to loss of old-growth mixed forests. In Finland, it is still locally quite common but declining everywhere, with detailed local studies showing 20-58% declines over periods of 10-20 years (Hanski <em>et al.</em> 2001, Hanski 2006). Declines were noted in all parts of Finland; there were no areas where the population was stable or increasing, and declines are predicted to continue in the future (Hanski 2006). A three year census ending in 2005 estimated the Finnish population at 140,000 females (95% confidence limits 134,800-151,300: Hanski 2006).  It has been found at c.50 sites in Estonia (T. Maran pers. comm. 2006). In Russia, it is considered widespread but rare in Karelia, and in the Karelian isthmus its status is similar to that of the Finnish population (A.

Now that the grey squirrel has become established on the continent, it can be expected that it may ultimately spread throughout much of the red squirrel's range. Grey squirrels not only out-compete the smaller red squirrels, but also carry parapox virus, which is highly pathogenic to red squirrels. Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected, and recent (2006) UK studies have shown that 61% of apparently healthy grey squirrels have been exposed to the virus and may be carriers (C. McInnes <em>in litt.</em> 2006). When the virus is present, the grey squirrel can replace the red squirrel 20 times faster than normal replacement rate (Rushton <em>et al.</em> 2006).

It occurs from the coast up in to mountains up to the tree line. It climbs trees, but lives in simple shallow burrows underground. Summer nests are in stumps, fallen trees, sometimes in low hollows. Usually the burrows consist of two big chambers, nest and larder, and small chambers used as a lavatory. These burrows can become up to 9 m in length, and each chipmunk 'owns' one burrow.

The Marine Otter has a restricted distribution along the Pacific coast from northern Peru along the Chilean coast to Cape Horn and Isla de Los Estados in Argentina. It is patchily distributed from Peru to Tierra del Fuego. Its distribution north of 39°S latitude is becoming highly fragmented because of exploitation, pollution and increased human occupation along the seashores. Poaching is still present in many regions, especially south of 39ºS latitude, where there is little or no enforcement of protective legislation. The greatest threats to its continuous existence are accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and competition for prey, accidental kill in crab pots and poaching throughout the range. The original range of Marine Otter has decreased considerably because of excessive hunting (Redford and Eisenberg 1992), and the species has been nearly exterminated from the regions of Cape Horn and southern Tierra del Fuego (Brownell 1978) as well as from the northern extremities of its former range (Chehebar 1990).</p><p>Additionally, Marine Otters are persecuted and killed directly for alleged damage to local fish, bivalves, and shrimp populations (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004).) Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing, accidental death by entanglement (bycatch) in fishing nets) are a frequent problem in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as Huarmey (Valqui 2012) and Paracas (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004, Valqui 2012). Pollution of the Marine Otter's habitat comes from several centres of industrial fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru, where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40 years, altering several kilometres of the littoral (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p><p>A&#160;common denominator for all the range countries is the weak law enforcement in Marine otter conservation as hunting or killings of otters at fish farms do not implicate consequences to the offenders.&#160;Global natural factors like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may considerably affect the marine otter population (Vianna <em>et al</em>. 2010), due to the more or less drastic climatic and oceanographic changes that cause the mortality of several marine communities from fish to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999, Wang and Fiedler 2006).</p><p>These threats are inferred to result in future population reductions of at least 50% over the next three generations (30 years Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) unless conservation measures are strengthened. Therefore it is proposed to keep the Marine Otter listed under the category Endangered based on criterion A3cde.</p>","<em>Lontra felina</em> is the only species of the genus <em>Lontra </em>that is found exclusively in marine habitats. It uses coastlines with range extending approximately 30 m inland and 100-150 m of sea offshore (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979). The species inhabits marine areas exposed to heavy seas and strong wind (Cabello 1978, Ostfeld <em>et al.</em> 1989) and prefers rocky shores with caves that are above water at high tide, as well as areas with large algae communities offering a wide abundance and diversity of prey species (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979). Sandy beaches offer marginal habitat (Sielfeld 1989) and typically are used only for travel between dens and water (Ebensperger and Castilla 1992). Marine Otters are, for the most part, restricted to marine waters, but may occasionally travel up freshwater rivers in search of prey (Brownell 1978, Cabello 1978, Redford and Eisenberg 1992). Because not all coastlines are suitable, marine otters are found in disjunct populations throughout their distribution range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992).<br/><br/>The fact that Marine Otters are solitary or only gathering in small groups suggests high ecological requirements regarding space. The species' preference for coastal waters offering a wide abundance and diversity of prey species (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979) is in conflict with the increasing artisan and industrial fishing effort. Marine Otters are top predators with a high metabolic rate, thus pollution of their environments may affect them more than other species, as their position in the food chain leads to high bioaccumulation of heavy metals, pesticides and other toxic elements.<br/><br/>The Marine Otter diet is composed mostly of invertebrates, including crustaceans (decapods, shrimps, and crabs) and molluscs (bivalves and gastropods), and vertebrate prey, including fish from the families Blennidae, Cheilodactylidae, Gobiesocidae, and Pomacentridae, and occasionally birds and small mammals (Cabello 1978, Castilla and Bahamondes 1979, Ostfeld <em>et al</em>. 1989, Sielfeld 1990). Along the Valdivian coast in the south of Chile the diet of marine otter consisted of 25 species; 52% (13/25) of the species identified were crustaceans, 40% (10/25) were fish, and 8% (2/25) were molluscs. Crustaceans were found in 78% of 475 spraints, 100% of 929 prey remains, and 90.8% of prey determined by direct observation, fish in 20% of spraints and 9.0% of prey determined by direct observation, and molluscs in 2% of spraints and 0.2% of prey determined by direct observation. Observed seasonal variation in prey availability was reflected in the otter diet. Fourteen prey species were trapped; 43% (6/14) were crustaceans and 57% (8/14) fish, crustaceans were 93% of 566 trapped individuals, fish 7%. <em>L. felina</em> showed opportunistic feeding behaviour, selecting prey seasonally according to their availability rather than to their energy input (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Some studies have found that fruits (<em>Greigia sphacelata</em>, <em>Fascicularia bicolor</em>) may also be consumed on occasion (Brownell 1978, Cabello 1978, Medina 1995). Marine Otters may compete with gulls (<em>Larus</em>) and the South American Sea Lion (<em>Otaria flavescens</em>) for similar species of prey fish (Cabello 1978). The most important natural predator of the Marine Otter is the Killer Whale (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Cabello 1978), but adults also may be killed by sharks (Parera 1996) and birds of prey may capture juveniles when on land (Cabello 1983). <br/><br/>The Marine Otter is most likely a monogamous species. Mating typically occurs during December or January (Cabello 1978) with gestation of 60-65 days (Housse 1953, Sielfield 1989). Parturition usually occurs from January to March. It takes place in a den or on shore between rocky outcroppings and vegetation. The litter size varies from two to four young, with two being observed most frequently. Young Marine Otters remain with their parents for approximately ten months. Adults transport their young by carrying them in their mouths or resting the young on their bellies as they swim on their backs. Both adults in the monogamous pair bring prey back to the den to feed their young (Parera 1996). When not breeding, Marine Otters are mostly solitary. The group size is seldom more than two to three individuals. Its activity pattern is generally diurnal, with peaks of activity noted in early morning, mid-afternoon, and evenings. Marine Otters are much more agile in the water than on land.","<p>Hunting was the major threat on the Marine Otter in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). 38 000 otter pelts were exported from Chile between 1910 and 1954 (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986). Although two otter species (<em>L. provocax</em> and <em>L. felina</em>) were subsumed as “otters” and no hunting estimate of each species can be inferred from this data, these numbers show the magnitude of the pelt industry in the 20<sup>th</sup>&#160;Century. Today, the lack of demand in the pelt market and fur trade prohibitions, have diminished the hunting threat considerably. Nonetheless, illegal hunting for fur and trophies still occurs in some areas as Samanco, (Sánchez and Ayala 2006), La Libertad (15°29'S) and Morro Sama (18°00'S) (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004), Peru and south of 39°S latitude in Chile.</p><p>In the last decades, the major threats derive from an intensive urbanization of western South America, where the immense anthropogenic pressure on the coastal ecosystem accelerates habitat degradation and increases its fragmentation (Brownell 1978, Eisenberg and Redford 1989, Sielfield and Castilla 1999, Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2008, Vianna <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is not yet clear at what point these fragmentation forces will cause isolation to result in local extinction events due to lack of gene flow (Valqui 2012). In any case, these global changes will trigger many specific more local threats in different regions. In and around human settlements, big dens with terrestrial entrances may be occupied by dogs, cats and rats, displacing the Marine Otter from its reproduction, feeding and resting areas (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2003, Valqui 2012). Dog attacks are increasingly reported in several locations of the distribution (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p><br/></p><p>Industrial and artisan fishing ports have been established along the Pacific coast, affecting structure and productivity of marine life communities. Although <em>Lontra felina</em> shows certain capacity to coexist with humans, for example in fishing ports (Valqui 2004, Ruiz 2009, Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2007), fishing has intensified global natural declines in the abundance of many forage fishes, leading to reduced reproductive success and reduced abundance of birds and marine mammals (Majluf <em>et al</em>. 2002). The human-otter coexistence implies competition for resources that humans exploit for food, commerce and housing (Moreno <em>et al</em>. 1984; Ostfeld <em>et al</em>. 1989; Moreno 2001; Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2007, 2008), as it is the case of mariculture (crabs and molluscs (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004). Additionally, marine otters may be persecuted and killed directly for alleged damage to local fish, bivalves, and shrimp populations (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004).). Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing) are a frequent problem in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as Huarmey (Valqui 2012) and Paracas (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004, Valqui 2012). Industrial ships have frequently been observed fishing closer to the coast than allowed by law (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004), perturbing the coastal habitat on a broader scale. Another threat for Marine Otters is accidental death by entanglement (bycatch) in fishing nets (Brownell 1978, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Pizarro 2008) and in crab pots (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2004), although the dimension of these mortality cases is unknown.</p><p><br/></p><p>Pollution of the Marine Otter´s habitat comes from several centres of industrial fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru, where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40 years, altering several kilometres of the littoral (Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p><p><br/></p><p>Additionally, spills of domestic effluents reach the ocean directly or through rivers (Hinrichsen 1998, Thorne-Miller 1999). Thus, heavy metals and other toxic substances can be diffused through currents and progressively transmitted through the food chain at least in a regional level (Valqui 2004, Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004). Oil spillage and extreme noise affect the species in areas near beach resorts in the vicinity of big cities (Valqui 2004).</p><p><br/></p><p>A common denominator for all regions is that there is very law enforcement regarding the Marine Otter´s conservation status and protection, as hunting or killings on fish farms do not implicate consequences to the offenders.</p><p><br/></p><p>Global natural factors like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may considerably affect the Marine Otter population (Vianna <em>et al</em>. 2010), due to the more or less drastic climatic and oceanographic changes that cause the mortality of several marine communities from fish to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999, Wang and Fiedler 2006).</p>","<p>The density estimates proposed by various authors are very variable (from 0.04 to 10 individuals per kilometre, see Castilla and Bahamondes 1979, Castilla 1982, Cabello 1983, Rozzi and Torres-Mura 1990, Ebensperger and Castilla 1991, Sanchez 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Medina-Vogel 1995, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2006), therefore the reported numbers are to be taken with care. Survey numbers and abundance estimations are highly dependent on the methodology applied (Valqui 2012) and detecting individuals on the rocky shores is very difficult. The fact that the species is solitary or only present in very small groups (not larger than ten individuals) makes it difficult to determine if the species is abundant in one specific area. Nevertheless a global population of about 800 to 2,000 individuals is proposed for the Peruvian coast (<em>ca</em>&#160;150 km) by Valqui (2012),&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marine Otter is distributed along the southern Pacific Coast of South America from Chimbote (9°S) in northern Peru (Valqui 2012), to Isla Grevy (56°S) at the southern tip of Chile (Sielfeld 1997) and eastwards to the Isla de los Estados (54°S), in Argentina (Parera 1996). &#160;In 1964, Schweigger reported <em>Lontra felina</em> up to the Isla Lobos de Tierra (6° 26'S) in northern Peru. Studies of the last decades registered the northern range limit at Chimbote (9°S) (Brack 1978, Brownell 1978, Larivière 1998, Apaza <em>et al</em>. 2004, Sánchez and Ayala 2006, Valqui <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent sightings in Huanchaco (8°S) suggest at least occasional events of recolonization north to the actual northern limit of distribution range, yet reasons for appearance or disappearance in these areas remain unclear (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the south the species´ presence is unclear in the XVth, Ist, XIth and XIIth regions and in the Tierra del Fuego region in Argentina (Cassini 2008).</p><p>Although Redford and Eisenberg (1992) stated that “The original range of <em>Lontra felina</em> has decreased considerably because of excessive hunting in the past decades“, the authors do not mention any specific regions or study cases. &#160;Brownell (1978) stated that ”the species has been nearly exterminated from the regions of Cape Horn and southern Tierra del Fuego” but several works (Sielfeld 1989, 1990, 1992; Sielfeld and Castilla 1999) reported the species' presence between 49°S (Puerto Orella) and 55°S (Isla Grevy).</p><p>The Marine Otter´s habitat is naturally fragmented in a very heterogeneous alternation of suitable habitat (rocky shore patches with caves or, sometimes, docks, shipwrecks or abandoned fishing boats) and unsuitable habitat (sandy beaches or rocky shoreline without caves). Thus, Marine Otters may be absent in several hundreds of kilometres of coast throughout the species´ total distribution range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Vianna <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Valqui 2012).</p>",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The Marine Otter is protected in Argentina, Chile, and Peru.

121707666,12519,Lynx lynx,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Listed as Least Concern given its wide range and stable populations in the north of Europe and in large parts of its range in Asia (Bao 2010, Bersenev <em>et al. </em>2011, Kaczensky&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). A recent assessment of the status of Eurasian Lynx (hereafter just Lynx) in Europe shows that some isolated subpopulations remain Critically Endangered or Endangered (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2012).</p>","The Eurasian Lynx occurs in a wide variety of environmental and climatic conditions (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2011). Throughout Europe and Siberia, it is primarily associated with forested areas which have good ungulate populations and which provide enough cover fur hunting. It inhabits extended, Temperate and Boreal forests from the Atlantic in Western Europe to the Pacific coast in the Russian Far East (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>In Europe it can be found in Mediterranean forests up to the transition zone of taiga to tundra and lives from sea level up to the tree line (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008).<br/><br/>In Central Asia, Lynx occur in more open, thinly wooded areas and steppe habitats. The species probably occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the tree line (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003, Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Lynx occur sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau, and are found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Armenia Lynx are strongly associated with true forests and arid sparse forests and to a lesser extent with subalpine meadows. Lynx have been observed up to 5,500 m (Guggisberg 1975).<br/><br/>The Eurasian Lynx is the largest lynx, and the only one to primarily take ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller species where ungulates are less abundant. Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smaller ungulate species, such as Roe Deer, Chamois, Reindeer and Musk Deer. Occasionally, Lynx also hunt foxes, hares, marmots, wild pigs, beavers, birds or domestic animals such as sheep and goats, or, in Scandinavia, semi-domestic reindeer. In European Russia and western Siberia, where Roe Deer are absent, Mountain Hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base. Hares and birds are important prey also in other Central Asian regions where habitats are dryer and less forested (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).<br/><br/>Home range size varies widely from 100 to over 1,000 km² (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Home ranges averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland’s Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 1997). Average home range sizes in Switzerland were 90 km² for females and 150 km² for male Lynx. Male home ranges generally enclose 1-2 female territories (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Densities are typically 1-3 adults per 100 km², although higher densities of up to 5/100 km² have been reported from Eastern Europe and parts of Russia and lower densities of 0.3/100 km² from Scandinavia (Jedrzejewski <em>et al</em>. 1996, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sunde <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Saihanwula nature reserve in Inner Mongolia the density was estimated at 1.7-2.1/100 km² by camera trapping and track survey (Bao <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Turkey, a density of 4.2/100 km² has been estimated for the Ciglikara Nature Reserve, Antalya. However, this high Lynx density may be temporarily and may decline with major prey (hare) fluctuation (Avgan <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p></p>","The major threats to Lynx in Europe are low acceptance due to conflicts with hunters (and in northern Europe also with livestock farmers), persecution, habitat loss and fragmentation mainly due to infrastructure development, poor management structures and accidental mortality (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the Jura Mountains human related mortalities (traffic accidents, poaching) were responsible for 70 % of the known losses (Breitenmoser-Würsten <em>et al</em>. 2007). There are also concerns in regard of the low genetic diversity and small population sizes shown in some of the populations (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff 2003, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sindicic <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx is mainly threatened by poaching, loss of prey base and habitat degradation (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Asia the major threats are habitat fragmentation and loss mainly due to livestock farming, infrastructure development, resource extraction and logging activities, and poaching, mainly as retaliatory killing due to livestock depredation or for the fur trade (Kretser <em>et al</em>. 2012, Mousavi <em>et al</em>. 2014). In areas where livestock is the primary livelihood source, the conflict is even enhanced. Other threats include accidental mortality through trapping or dogs and human disturbance (Bao 2010). In Russia the Lynx is still important for the skin market and the pelt industry. In Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Pakistan prey base depletion due to poaching is considered a major threat (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ud Din and Nawaz 2010). In Turkey and Nepal low population size is assumed to be problematic.<br/><br/>Poor management structures and insufficient law enforcement and the lack of capacity and funding facilitate poaching and lead to higher habitat fragmentation, aggravating the situation of the Lynx (Shkvyria 2012).","The European Lynx population (excluding Russia and Belarus) has been estimated at 9,000-10,000. In Europe, the Lynx is divided into ten distinct subpopulations which are: Alpine, Balkan, Baltic, Bohemian-Bavarian, Carpathian, Dinaric, Jura, Karelian, Scandinavian and Vosges Palatinian (Kaczensky<em> et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Most Lynx populations in Europe are generally stable. However, status and trend varies greatly within the European range (Kaczensky<em> et al</em>. 2012, Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Balkan and the Vosges-Palatinian subpopulations have decreased and the Jura and the Scandinavian ones have increased (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). The autochthonous populations in north and east Europe (Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic and Carpathian) number each around 2,000 individuals. All the re-introduced populations are of small size (less than 200 or even less than 100 animals) and are classified as Endangered (Alpine, Dinaric and Jura subpopulation) or Critically Endangered (Bohemian-Bavarian, Vosges-Palatinian subpopulation) (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). The European population with the greatest conservation concern is the Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx subpopulation estimated at only 40-50 individuals (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013, Melovski 2012). In the Ukraine the Lynx is considered to be decreasing (Bashta and Dykyy 2013, Shkvyria and Shevchenko 2009).&#160; Its population in the Carpathian region has been estimated at 350-400 and the one in the Polysya region in the north of the country at 80-100 animals. Detailed status and trend information on European subpopulations can be found on <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm</a>.<br/><br/>Although a large portion of the Lynx’s range is in Asia, status and trend in many countries are poorly understood due to insufficient data. The following information has been gathered through a questionnaire sent to range country representatives (see supplementary material). In Russia the Lynx is thought to be stable in some regions and to be decreasing in others (Bersenev <em>et al</em>. 2011). The Russian Lynx population has been estimated at around 22,510 individuals in 2013 (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl)). The numbers are based on different methods in different regions, but mainly on winter tracking plus expert corrections. More accurate censuses are performed in regions with lower lynx densities than in areas where they are abundant. Lynx has been estimated to number 1,940 in the Central region, 4,110 in North-western region, 680 in the Northern Caucasus, 40 in the Southern region, 2,400 in the Volga region, 1,070 in the Ural, 6,390 in the Siberian region&#160; and 5,890 in the Russian Far East for 2013 (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl) and with help of V.V. Rozhnov 2014). In Mongolia the Lynx population was estimated at around 10,000 (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). The Lynx population in China has been estimated at around 27,000 by the State Forestry Administration in 2009 and is listed as Vulnerable (Wang 1998, Bao 2010). Its population and range is thought to be increasing in Inner Mongolia.<br/><br/>In Afghanistan the presence of the Lynx has been confirmed by camera trap surveys in the Wakhan District of Badakhshan and in the Northern Plateau, Yakawlang District of Bamyan provinces, since 2006. In Armenia the lynx is thought to be a common species, especially in some protected areas but the population trend is unknown. In Azerbaijan Lynx populations are thought to be stable in the Talysh Mountains, Zangezur Ridge and the foothills of the Greater Caucasus, and in arid and semi-arid landscapes around the Mingechaur Water Reservoir. In Bhutan the lynx is thought to occur in the Jigme Dorji National Park and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, however, no concrete evidence exists (Wangchuck <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Lynx is proposed as Vulnerable in Iran (Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Iraq, except a Lynx sighting in 2006 in Darbandikhan and the first confirmed record of Eurasian Lynx in 2011 from the Barzan area, there are no recent observations (Barzani 2013). The population in Kyrgyzstan is thought to be stable but not very high and classified as Near Threatened (Sludsky 1978). The Lynx is thought to be decreasing in Nepal and classified as Vulnarable (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2011), but there is no hard evidence. The only indication for its presence comes from the northwestern district of Humla, from the Dhorpatan hunting reserve and upper Mustand area in the Annapurna conservation area in 1996 (Fox 1985). Jnawali <em>et al</em>. (2011) maps the distribution of the lynx additionally in the Rara National Park and Shey-Phoksundo National Park. The Lynx might be declining in Pakistan and its long-term survival is not assured, although it is listed as Least Concern (Sheikh and Molur 2004). In 2003 the Lynx population in northern Pakistan has been estimated at 80-120 animals and the permanently occupied area in the whole country at around 25,252 km² (Sheikh and Molur 2004). In Tajikistan the Lynx is considered as rare and is mainly found in the southern part of the country in the Darvaz range, westernmost part of the Pamir Mountains, the Ghunda valley and the Wakhan valley. In Uzbekistan, the Lynx is considered Vulnerable and thought to be decreasing but seems to be stable in the Gissar Nature Reserve, with an estimated population of 130 in 2013.",Stable,"<p>The Eurasian Lynx has a very broad distribution. It occurs along forested mountain ranges in southeastern and Central Europe and from northern and eastern Europe through the Boreal forests of Russia, down into Central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Kaczensky <em>et al.</em> 2012, Nowell and Jackson 1996,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The Lynx's stronghold is a broad strip of southern Siberian woodland stretching from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). Subpopulations in the southeast of its range (Europe and southwest Asia) are generally small and widely separated, whereas the bulk of its historic range from Scandinavia through Russia and Central Asia is largely intact.<br/> <br/> In Europe, it was probably absent from some of the larger islands such as Ireland and Sicily and from countries with few forests. It was also absent from the Iberian Peninsula, where the smaller Iberian Lynx<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>Lynx pardinus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;occurs. Lynx have been extirpated from most of Western and Central Europe with the exception of the Carpathian Mountains. It survived in a small area in the Balkans (Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro). Larger populations persisted in Fennoscandia, the Baltic States, and European Russia. Lynx have been released in several countries of Europe in an effort to bring back this elusive predator, including in Switzerland, Slovenia, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and France (IUCN 2007).</span></p>",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II and protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix III).

In Sweden, Finland and Romania the lynx is protected but a limited number of Lynx can be killed under derogation. In Estonia and Norway the lynx is listed as a game species with an open hunting season and in Latvia Lynx can be exploited to a limited extent by sports hunting (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Lynx is also subject to hunting in Iraq and Russia. In Russia, the Lynx is only hunted in places where it is abundant as in some areas of the Central region and the Volga region, in most areas of the North-Western region, the Ural, the Sibirian region and the Russian Far East. Hunting is not allowed in the Northern Caucasus and in the Southern region. The Lynx is not protected in Armenia.<br/><br/>Since 2006, a programme for the recovery of the Balkan Lynx is being implemented and range wide conservation strategies were developed (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). In several European range states, prevention measures to counteract livestock depredation are in place and awareness has increased but measures for managing conflicts with hunters are still missing (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>There is a need for improved monitoring activities in the Carpathian and Dinaric Lynx populations in Europe and many parts of Asia (a.o. Ud Din and Nawaz 2010, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). Connectivity between small isolated European lynx populations should be enhanced to allow gene flow and prevent inbreeding depression (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer Ruff 2003). In Italy and Austria a reinforcement project has started to address the threat of genetic deterioration due to low population size and lacking connectivity by translocating Lynx. Detailed recommendations for the conservation of the European subpopulations are given in <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm</a>.<br/><br/>Genetic monitoring is also needed in parts of Asia to detect the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the Lynx (Bao 2010).<br/><br/>In some parts of its range awareness for the species was enhanced as for example in Iraq, where stakeholders, students and social media were engaged to stop illegal hunting or as in Afghanistan, where public awareness has been raised among local communities, particularly in Badakhsahn and Bamyan Provinces, wildlife laws have been enforced in some areas and the Border Police and Customs office in certain parts of the country have been trained to control fur trade. In China the patrolling by local police was strengthened and a nature reserve network was established to expand suitable Lynx habitat. In Iran a preliminary status assessment of the lynx was conducted from 2006-2009 and a country wide status assessment in 2010-2012 (Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010, Mousavi <em>et al</em>. in press). In Pakistan measures specific for carnivore conservation have been introduced which benefit also the Lynx. In 2010 a project focusing on lynx research and conservation education has been implemented and the protected area network has been increased. In Tajikistan measures adopted to reduce conflicts with Snow Leopards are working for Lynx as well.<br/><br/>From most range states there is only sparse information on the lynx available. Data on population trend is mainly missing. There is a need for management improvement, better monitoring and more research on Lynx ecology and distribution in Asia to increase the knowledge on the population status and trend, as well as on threats and conservation needs (Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010, Bao 2010).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

True rates of decline are imperfectly known but are unlikely to exceed 50%. The assessors have chosen to take a precautionary approach in listing the species as Vulnerable, especially considering the burgeoning demand for pangolins in the Asian markets, the resultant severe declines in some Asian pangolin populations and more recently plausible declines in at least two African pangolin species and the unquantified levels of both local and international trade (although both are known to be increasing). The growing human population is also increasingly restricting this species to protected areas through a combination of direct persecution and habitat transformation, with a simultaneous decrease in the Area of Occupancy. Further research into the levels of trade and status of this species is urgently required.</p>","This is a predominantly solitary, terrestrial species that inhabits mainly savannas and woodlands in low-lying regions with moderate to dense scrub where average annual rainfall is between 250 mm and 1,400 mm. Also occurs in floodplain grassland, rocky slopes and sandveld up to 1,700 m asl (Coulson 1989, Pietersen 2013, Swart 2013), but does not inhabit forest or true desert. It occurs widely on well-managed livestock farms where it is afforded protection from human persecution, but is absent from croplands and human settlements. <br/><br/>Temminck's Pangolins are largely water independent but will drink from free-standing water when it is available (Stuart 1980, D. Pietersen, unpubl. data). The most important habitat requirements are believed to be a sufficient population of the various ant and termite prey species and the availability of dens or above-ground debris in which to shelter. Ambient temperatures and annual temperature fluctuations are likely also important governing factors as these directly affect the prey species, while pangolins also have poor thermoregulatory capabilities and appear to rely on environmental conditions for thermoregulation (Pietersen 2013).<br/><br/>The female gives birth to a single young (rarely twins) after a gestation period of 105–140 days (van Ee 1966, D.W. Pietersen unpubl. data, R, Jansen, unpubl. data). Based on the gestation period, the observed time that it takes the female to regain her pre-parturition condition and field observations on the frequency of births, it is suspected that females may only give birth every second year. Adults come together briefly to mate and the offspring typically remains with the mother for 3–6 months, though this appears to vary somewhat with region (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, W. Panaino unpubl. data). Young start dispersing when about one year old (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>There are very few data on the longevity of any pangolin species in the wild, making estimates of generation length difficult. Two Indian Pangolins (<em>Manis crassicaudata</em>), which have a similar ecology and are of a similar size to Temminck’s Pangolin, lived for 12 and 19 years, respectively, in captivity (Hoyt 1987; Weigl, 2005). Considering that captive pangolins usually show a greatly attenuated lifespan (Hoyt 1987, Hua <em>et al</em>. 2015), these lifespans are probably minimum estimates. Based on available growth rates, the relative late onset of the start of reproduction, the slow reproductive rate (on average one young per year, perhaps only every second year), and longevity of the sympatric Aardvark (<em>Orycteropus afer</em>), which has a similar ecology and life history, Temminck’s Pangolins are expected to be relatively long-lived, probably surviving for 20 years or more in the wild (D.W. Pietersen and L. Hywood, unpubl. data).","Although present in a number of protected areas across their range and protected by law in all range states (though not included as a protected species in all range states), it is inferred that Temminck's Pangolin numbers are declining due to an increasing demand for their body parts, including scales, for local and international use for medicinal purposes and superstitious value (Coulson 1985, Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994, Whiting<em> et al</em>. 2011, Swart 2013, Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016, Baiyewu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Over-exploitation of Temminck's Pangolin for medicinal use is occurring in South Africa and elsewhere throughout its range, and is increasingly focused on core conservation areas (Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Baiyewu <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/><br/>There has been a sharp increase in the number of individuals that have been seized from illegal trade since 2010 (APWG unpubl. data, Tikki Hywood Foundation unpubl. data). Although the final market for these individuals is unknown, the majority were confiscated in rural areas suggesting local use, although some were confiscated in ports and high-end suburbs suggesting that at least some individuals are likely destined for international markets or for local consumption, potentially by foreigners. This is further supported by large shipments of scales being exported from East Africa to Asia (Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/>A number of seizures of African pangolins or their body parts in Asia (or en route to Asia) provide evidence of an intercontinental trade in African pangolins to Asian markets (Challender and Hywood 2012, Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016, Cheng <em>et al</em>. 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017). The demand for, and price of, pangolin products in Asia appears to be increasing, and traffickers are turning their attention to the African species. As syndicates smuggling pangolins (and rhino horn and ivory) from Africa to Asia become ever more sophisticated and as the Asian pangolin numbers dwindle, so African pangolin species have become more important as source populations for the Asian markets.<br/>Across its range Temminck’s Pangolin is increasingly threatened by shifting agriculture, small-holder farming and agro-industry farming. These farming practices are directly impacting pangolins through habitat loss and alteration, while the increased human presence in these previously undisturbed areas is resulting in increased levels of poaching. Nomadic grazing is also having a negative impact on Temminck’s Pangolins across their range as a result of increased levels of poaching. In Zimbabwe, and likely in other parts of this species’ range, artisanal mining is negatively impacting pangolins and other wildlife species. Artisanal mining results in the creation of deep mining pits which are invariably abandoned once the mineral reserves are depleted. These pits are left uncovered and form lethal pitfall traps into which various animals fall and cannot escape. Artisanal mining also affects pangolins through increased rates of poaching and habitat destruction, while a lot of these mining activities (especially in Zimbabwe) occur within the borders of National Parks and other protected areas.<br/>Temminck's Pangolins are regularly electrocuted on the lower strands of electrified fences in South Africa in particular (Beck 2008, Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014), but also throughout their range where electrified fences are prevalent. The mortality rate for South Africa is estimated at 2–13% of the total population per annum (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fencing is becoming more prevalent across this species’ range, and although not all of these fences are electrified, these fences are likely to become more prevalent and more widespread. Road mortalities are also having a negative impact on the species (Coulson 1989, Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014). In South Africa and Namibia accidental bycatch of Temminck’s Pangolins in gin traps that have been set for other species is also a threat, while in Zimbabwe substantial habitat alteration and loss of protected areas due to changes in the land use systems since independence has further impacted populations (L. Hywood, unpubl. data). Elsewhere in Africa local and international trade and habitat loss are the main threats, although reports of accidental electrocutions are increasingly reported from across the species’ range (L. Hywood, E. Connelly and D.W. Pietersen, unpubl. data).","<p>In the eastern Lowveld of South Africa Temminck's Pangolins have an estimated breeding density of 0.12 individuals/km² and an estimated total density of 0.24 individuals/km² (Swart 2013). In the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, densities have been calculated at 0.16 reproductively active individuals/km² and overall densities at 0.23 individuals/km² (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Gokwe district of Zimbabwe they had an estimated overall density of 0.11 individuals/km² (Heath and Coulson 1997, Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014); however populations in Zimbabwe are thought to have decreased since this time (L. Hywood and E. Connelly, unpubl. data). South Africa is estimated to have 16,329–24,102 mature individuals (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2016) but abundances in other regions of Africa are unknown.</p>",Decreasing,"The most widespread African pangolin species, recorded from southeastern Chad, through South Sudan, much of East Africa and southern Africa as far south as the Northern Cape, North-West and northeast KwaZulu-Natal Provinces of South Africa (Swart 2013, Pietersen <em>et al.</em> 2016), with the western limits of its range being reached in Namibia and southern Angola. The northern limits of the distribution are not well defined, although the species has been recorded from extreme northeastern Central African Republic, southeastern Chad and South Sudan (Swart 2013, APWG unpubl. data). They are also confirmed from the Omo River basin region of southwest Ethiopia and so probably do occur, marginally, in the western border regions of Ethiopia (Swart 2013). Their presence in Somalia is doubtful (Swart 2013). Records from West Africa undoubtedly refer to the Giant Pangolin (<em>Smutsia gigantea</em>; see Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species may have been extirpated in eSwatini (Pietersen <em>et al.</em> 2016)","The species is eaten as bushmeat to various extents across its range (for example in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and Tanzania), although its use as bushmeat appears to be limited. Of greater threat is overexploitation for body parts and scales which have superstitious and spiritual value and which are extensively used for medicinal purposes (Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 2004, Setlalekgomo 2014, Baiyewu <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Tanzania, Temminck’s Pangolins are sometimes referred to as <em>Bwana mganga</em> ('the doctor') because every part is believed to have some medicinal value (Wright 1954). Many East African people believe that burning pangolin scales keeps lions away (Kingdon 1971). Across their range the scales are widely believed to bring good luck and to bring rain, while smoke from burning scales is said to improve the health of cattle and cure persistent nose-bleeds. The amaZulu believe that seeing a pangolin indicates that there will be a drought, and the only way to prevent the drought is by killing the animal (Kyle 2000). Scales are also used as talismans and in traditional dress (Kyle 2000, Manwa and Ndamba 2011).<br/>In Zimbabwe it is traditionally a good omen to catch and present a pangolin to a superior such as a local chief (Coulson 1985) and 25 individuals were reportedly captured and presented to the Zimbabwean president and other authority figures at the onset of majority rule in Zimbabwe. <br/><br/>Between 2008 and 2018 more than 100 Temminck’s Pangolins were seized in Africa, each comprising one individual (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In South Africa, trade has increased dramatically with 10 individuals seized in 2016, 16 in 2017 and 43 in 2018 (APWG unpubl. data). In addition to local use, there is increasing evidence that at least some of the trade is destined for international markets (Challender and Hywood 2012, Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Terrestrial,"Although locally extirpated in some areas (e.g., parts of South Africa - see Pietersen <em>et al.</em> 2016), Temminck's Pangolins occur in many national parks and other protected areas (e.g. Kruger National Park, South Africa). While it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and is afforded at least some legislative protection in all range states, there is a need to improve protective legislation and facilitate capacity development to enforce this legislation over much of its range. Projects are needed to determine current population densities and rates of population decline through anthropogenic influences. These should be coupled with research into the scale of both local and intercontinental trade in this species. Mitigation measures are also required to reduce the number of pangolins that are electrocuted on electrified fences.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
123789863,2815,Bison bison,Near Threatened,C2a(i),2017,2016-09-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is listed as Near Threatened in light of its dependence on ongoing conservation program to persist beyond the next 5 years, a very limited number of viable populations (five), and large number of small (13 of 20 less than 400) isolated populations. The North America bison population underwent a drastic decline in the 19th century caused by over hunting but has since partially recovered. There has been a modest increases in the number of conservation herds and individuals in populations managed for species conservation and ecological restoration, however, all mature individuals occur within active management programs which if ceased would result in the species qualifying for a threatened status. About 97% of the continental population is managed for private captive commercial propagation; very few of these herds are managed primarily for species conservation and none is managed in the public interest for conservation. Herds managed for conservation purposes in the public interest are typically small (&lt;400), and populations are widely dispersed with few geographic situations that provide conditions for natural movements between subpopulations. The total number of mature individuals in wild free-ranging and semi-free-ranging populations is estimated to be approximately 11,248-13,123 and only 4 subpopulations have more than 1,000 individuals, thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). The species is not currently in decline but wild mature individuals could be greatly reduced if current management regimes are changed or removed. This is a conservation dependant species.<br/> <br/> The current number of ecologically restored large populations managed primarily for conservation (populations exceeding 1,000 and managed in the presence of most natural limiting factors) is small. The species is most limited in Mexico, where only one herd may remain in the wild; it is subject to adverse policies when individuals move across the international border into the United States where they are classified as livestock. Creation of opportunities for a few additional, large-scale ecological restoration projects is dependent on cooperation between government agencies and non-government organizations. Future progress in conservation and recovery of the North American bison will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by federal and state/provincial agencies, harmonization of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organizations, and public tolerance and support of wild, free-ranging bison managed as wildife on limited, large-scale landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different agencies or organizations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">The likelihood of wild bison increasing over the next five years is entirely dependent upon conservation interventions.&#160;Currently six of the 20 wild herds representing 11,956 animals (63.7%) are anchored by National Parks, Refuges or Sanctuaries. Without these large protected landscapes bison would not likely survive and the future survival of American bison would be in serious jeopardy. Beyond these 6 herds in protected areas the remaining 14 wild herds are dependent upon conservation actions and management decisions by conservation programs of States, Tribes and Provinces who regulate the populations to assure sustainability of these herds.&#160;None of the 20 wild bison herds would persist without the management prescriptions and subsequent actions of the managing authorities.&#160;Wood bison are currently protected under the Species at Risk Act and are managed under a National Recovery Strategy.&#160;Hence, wild bison (wood or plains) are totally dependent upon conservation actions and protected lands.&#160;American Bison would not persist without those intensive conservation measures.</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">North American bison are primarily grazers and forage primarily in grassland and meadow vegetative communities. They had the widest natural range of any North American herbivore, from the arid grasslands of Chihuahua State in northern Mexico, through the grasslands of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, to the riparian meadows of interior Alaska. They can persist in arid regions (e.g. Mexico and New Mexico) and in areas experiencing deep snow cover (e.g., Yellowstone National Park). Grasses and sedges form the mainstay of the annual diet in all regions. However, summer and fall diets may be broader, including flowering plants, woody plant leaves, and lichens, in addition to grasses and sedges, depending on local availability. Bison excavate snow at foraging sites by sweeping it away using side to side motions of their muzzle. The plains bison undertook seasonal migrations when they were abundant prior to European settlement of the continent. Bison no longer migrate owing to land use change contributing to range restriction and depopulation. The Wood Bison was not migratory and remains so. Both subspecies exhibit strong seasonal aggregation during the calving through breeding seasons (May through August).</p>","In the 19th Century, market, subsistence and recreational hunting nearly eliminated the bison throughout its range in North America. Conservation measures have brought about limited recovery in the wild and in captive conservation herds. Private commercial production of bison has resulted in significant numerical recovery, but does not provide for conservation of the bison as wildlife in the sense used for Red List designation. Existing threats include: habitat loss; genetic manipulation of commercial bison for market traits; small population effects in most conservation herds; few herds are exposed to a full range of natural limiting factors (natural selection); cattle gene introgression; loss of genetic non-exchangeability through hybridization between bison subspecies; and the threat of depopulation as a management response to infection of some wild populations hosting reportable cattle diseases. Canada, the United States and Mexico list bison nationally as both wildlife and domestic livestock. Legal status varies among State and Provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, four provinces and two territories classify bison as both wildlife and livestock. Bison are legally classified as livestock in the United Sates only 10 states classify bison as wildlife in all or portions of the state. An additional threat to populations of this species is culling to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.","There are approximately 31,000 total bison in 68 conservation herds (herds managed in the public interest by governments and environmental organizations) in North America. These include about 20,000 Plains Bison and 11,000 total Wood Bison. For this assessment we applied a rigorous set of criteria to classify herds as functioning as wild, functioning as wild with limitations and not functioning as wild. We excluded from this assessment 30 of 68 conservation bison herds that are very small (&lt;300) and managed on small landscapes (&lt;10,000 acres) for education, public viewing and research. Based on our criteria these bison cannot function as wild bison under current management schemes. We also did not include 9,523 bison in 18 herds managed behind fences and held in captivity, although these are important conservation herds. These herds are considered captive, intensively husbanded and culled by artificial selection.<br/><br/>There are 14,703 bison in eight herds that are in populations &gt;400 and function as wild bison subject to the full range of natural selections forces. Another 4,044 wild bison are found in 12 herds that free-range but suffer from small populations size (&lt;400) and may experience limited predation from large carnivores. For this assessment we considered the wild bison population to be 18,748 bison from these 20 free-ranging herds occupying large landscapes and primarily subjected to the forces of natural selection. We conducted Population Viability Analyses (PVA) for the eight largest herds to determine both the demographic and genetic viability of each population and their viability if they were managed as a meta-population out to 200 years (see the attached PVA report).<br/><br/>The number of calves and yearlings in a bison population will vary considerably between populations and years (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2008). Therefore It is difficult to establish the exact number of mature individuals in each of 20 bison herds but demographic data from many show that 30-40% are individuals under 2 years of age. We estimated that there are between 11,248 and 13,123 mature bison in the current populations of wild free-ranging bison in North America.<br/><br/>Populations are considered viable in the long term if they exceed 1,000 individuals (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are two Plains Bison conservation herds and two Wood Bison conservation herds each exceeding 1,000 individuals—therefore according to this criteria the total number of viable populations is only four. However, a specific population viability analysis was performed on the eight bison herds functioning as wild and results demonstrate that all are demographically viable but all but the two largest herds will lose 5-8% of their genetic diversity over the next 200 years (see the PVA report in the Supplementary Material).",Stable,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The original North American range <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">for <em>Bison bison</em> extended from northern Mexico to Alaska. Plains Bison (<em>B. b. bison</em>) occurred from Northern Mexico to central Alberta, Canada. Wood Bison (<em>B. b. athabascae</em>) occurred from central Alberta, Canada to Alaska, USA. The species' current range is restricted by land use and wildlife management policies in the southern area and by wildlife and reportable disease management policies in the northern portion of the North American range. Bison functioning as wild currently occupy less than 1.2% of their original range (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""><em> </em>2008, this report).</span></span></p>","<p>Approximately 300,000 bison are commercially propagated on 4,000 farms and ranches in North America (based on data from 2014). Conservation practices vary widely among private owners and are not regulated. Escapes from private commercial herds have been documented in Montana, Alberta, and British Columbia. Artificial selection for market traits is a cause for concern: escaped individuals may become established in the wild or interbreed with established wild populations.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">A recovery program for wood bison has existed in Canada since the early 1960s where the subspecies was designated as 'Threatened' by the Committee on Endangered Species of Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). In May 2004 COSEWIC assessed the status of plains bison and recommended listing them as 'Threatened' in Canada. National Refuges and Parks and State parks play an important role in maintaining conservation herds in Canada and the United States. Wild free-ranging herds are managed by government agencies. The Nature Conservancy manages 13 captive herds and the American Prairie Reserve manages one fenced bison herd primarily for conservation objectives. Restoration of large populations of plains bison are being considered in Alberta, southern Colorado, Arizona and northern Montana. The State of Alaska recently reintroduced wood bison to the wild in the Yukon region. Better coordination among various federal initiatives for plains bison conservation is being accomplished by a designated Department of Interior Bison Working Group commissioned by secretarial order in 2008. A Plains Bison reintroduction is scheduled for Banff National Park in spring 2017.<br/> <br/> The Bison Specialist Group (North America) produced a bison conservation assessment and action plan that provides support and guidance for policy development and conservation planning and management for public and private sector projects, including: numeric, geographic and genetic status of North American bison, including public and private herds; a review of legislation and policies of individual range states regarding bison conservation; geographic assessment of priority conservation areas in North America (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010); enhancing the capacity of members of the Bison Specialist Group and organizations they represent to provide timely, innovative and practical solutions to conservation challenges; guidelines for management in support of species’ conservation and ecological restoration. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are potential opportunities for ecological restoration of herds managed primarily for conservation on federal, state, provincial lands in some jurisdictions (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, Freese <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recently the U.S. Department of Interior published a document titled “looking forward” where they enumerated potential restoration sites in the United States (National Park Service 2014a). In addition the U.S. National Park Service has identified bison restoration as a key activity in their plan for the next 100 years. Badlands National Park is undertaking a bison range expansion within the parks boundaries that will permit increasing the population management target from 800 bison to &gt;1,000 bison.</span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There may also be opportunities for establishing herds on Native-owned lands that are managed for combined conservation and socio-economic purposes.

Given the inherent difficulty of assessing this species, the normally low density with which it occupies the landscape and the effects that small population and habitat degradations can have on the species, our minimum assessment of population decrease could be a significant underestimate.<br/><br/>Since the previous Red List assessment in 2008, the threats to Jaguars have continued or intensified. The first expert mapping of Jaguar range took place in 2002 (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), and the resulting map was used for the 2008 Red List assessment. Today, more is known about Jaguar distribution and abundance, allowing us to retrospectively classify areas as Jaguar range in 2015 that were previously identified as non-range or gaps in knowledge (Supplementary Material Figure 1). The 2015 mapping exercise also reflects updates to range recommended by Jaguar experts, with sufficient evidence (i.e., tracks, camera-trap photos, sightings of live or dead animals) to warrant inclusion/exclusion of range. The updated range indicates increasing fragmentation of Jaguar populations, particularly in eastern and southeastern Brazil, northern Venezuela and the Maya Forest (Selva Maya) of Mexico and Guatemala. Comparing 2015 Jaguar range to the extent of “known” range from the 2002 exercise, thereby controlling for the difference in knowledge extent, there is a 20.0% decline in Jaguar range over the past fourteen years (2002-2015), from 8.77 million km² to 7.02 million km² (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). With a more robust range map from which to begin the next assessment, the species will likely qualify for VU in the near future.<br/><br/>With a generation length of 6.84 years, we suspect at least a 20-25% loss in mature individuals over the past 21 years (three generations) because there are documented population declines together with habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Paviolo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Jedrzejewski <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales (de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017a, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","The Jaguar has a stocky, heavy body with short massive limbs associated with reduced cursorial behaviour and dense forest habitat, and robust canines and large head allowing a more powerful bite than other large cats (Seymour 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Mean body weight varies by up to 100% across their range, those living further from the equator tend to be larger (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990). This extreme variation in size may reflect variation in the availability of large prey in different habitats: the largest Jaguars occur in open flood plains areas, the Llanos in Venezuela and the Pantanal in Brazil, and take the largest prey, and the smallest Jaguars inhabit the dense forest areas of Central America and Amazonia and take smaller prey (Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi 1996, Oliveira 2002).<br/><strong><br/><u>Habitat</u></strong><br/>Jaguar habitat is typically characterized by dense forest cover (mainly primary and secondary forest), the presence of water bodies and a sufficient prey base (Swank and Teer 1989, Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). However, they are found in range of habitats from rainforest to seasonally flooded swamp areas, pampas grassland, thorn scrub woodland, and dry deciduous forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars mainly inhabit tropical lowland forest, followed by dry tropical forest, xeric habitats and finally arable lowland pastures (Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Although Jaguars have been reported from elevations as high as 3000 m (Brown and Lopez Gonzalez 2001), they typically avoid montane forest, and have not been found in the high plateau of central Mexico or above 2700 m in the Andes (Ceballos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>, 2011). The species is more strongly associated with water in comparison to any of the other Panthera cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), indicated by their higher densities within tropical moist forests than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest (Maffei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Even within drier areas they are only found around the main water courses. This characteristic quickly brings them into conflict with expansion of high intensity agriculture, having the same requirements of nearby water sources for irrigation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Home range</strong></u><br/>Jaguar home ranges vary in size across their geographic range, often according to the season and availability of resources (e.g. Crawshaw and Quigley 1991, Núñez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). Generally males range further than females.<br/><br/>In the dry tropical deciduous forest of Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, female home range size ranged from 25 km² (dry season) to 60 km² (wet season) (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Nunez et al 2002). In the semi-deciduous and seasonally flooded forest of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, male home range size ranged from 33 to 41 km² for males and 32 to 59 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In the tropical broadleaf moist lowland secondary forest of Belize, male home range size ranged from 28 to 40 km² (radio telemetry; Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). In the mosaic landscape (secondary broadleaf forest, savannah and agriculture) of Central Belize, male home ranges ranged from 103 to 194 km² in the dry season and 179 to 386 in the wet season, and from 86 to 99 km² for a single female in the dry and wet seasons respectively (95% MCP, GPS collars, Figueroa 2013).<br/><br/>In the llanos of Venezuela, home range size ranged from 93 to 100 km² (males, dry season) and ranged from 51 to 80 km² for females in the wet season and dry season respectively (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Scognamillo <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There are numerous studies of home ranges from the seasonally inundated landscape of the Brazilian Pantanal: females 25 to 38 km² (radio telemetry; Schaller and Crawshaw 1980), females 5km² and males 20 km² for males in the wet season, and 70 and 79km², respectively, in the dry season (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw and Quigley 1991), female 38km² and male 67km² (95% fixed kernel, radio telemetry; Azevedo and Murray 2007), 57 to 176 km² (95% MCP, GPS collars; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), and females 34 to 101 km² in the wet season, and 42 to 89 km² in the dry season, and males 79 to 149 km² in the wet season, and 58 to 263 km² in the dry season (90% adaptive kernel estimator, GPS collars, Cavalcanti and Gese (2009).<br/><br/>In the semi-deciduous rainforest of the Brazilian Atlantic forests, male home range size ranged from 87 to 139 km², and from 44 to 133 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Cullen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). It can be seen in the above review that the more recent studies using GPS technology show considerably larger range sizes compared to older VHF studies, this is especially indicative for recent GPS studies from areas where previously VHF studies were carried out. The differences are ranging from ~4-6 times larger. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these older ranges are considerably underrepresenting Jaguar home ranges. Densities based on these ranges are therefore equally overestimated.<br/><strong><br/><u>Diet</u></strong><br/>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters. Over 85 prey species (wild and livestock/domestic), including mammals, reptiles and birds, have been recorded in their diet across their geographic range (Seymour 1989).<br/><br/>Jaguars take a wide variety of prey species but large-sized ungulates are preferred when available (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The intake of large prey likely helps Jaguars save energy, since it is estimated that 50% of kills are larger prey on which they will feed for up to 4 days (Schaller and Crawshaw 1980, Nunez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Nevertheless, Jaguar diet is highly variable, depending on prey availability, ease of capture, and a variety of additional factors (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Seymour 1989). In some areas cattle (<em>Bos</em> sp.) comprise an important item in their diet (Polisar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palmeira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Cavalcanti and Gese 2010). The decline of wild prey below a minimum threshold increases livestock depredation by big cats (Khorozyan <em>et al</em>. 2015), which in turn may lead to retaliatory killings of felids by livestock owners. High frequency of smaller prey species is frequently reported in Jaguar diet, e.g. armadillo (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Novack <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Foster <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). The species has therefore gained a reputation of being able to persist in relatively disturbed areas with incomplete prey assemblages (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). However, most diet studies rely on scat analysis. Palomares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) showed that the high majority of these scats are from males. Diet studies are therefore highly biased towards male diets. As males do not contribute anything to the rearing of young, as single individuals, they are able to sustain themselves better at a varied diet of small species. Mothers with cubs will likely require the larger ungulates but this important component of the populations is extremely poorly represented in diet studies of scats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Reproduction</strong></u><br/>There are few studies on the reproductive ecology of Jaguars in the wild. Males and females may come together for breeding opportunities at any time of the year (e.g. Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). The female is in oestrus 6-17 day period, and gestation lasts 91-101 days (in captivity), after which the female gives birth to up to four cubs, usually two, which will stay with her for up to 24 months (Mondolfi and Hoogesijn 1982, Seymour 1989, Kitchener 1991, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cubs are fully dependent on their mother’s milk for the first 10-11 weeks, and continue to suckle until 5-6 months old (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cycling could resume 2-3 weeks following lactational anestrus (Soares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). However, inter-birth intervals documented in the wild are approximately two years (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Carrillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). By 15-18 months, Jaguars travel and hunt independently within their mother’s range, although they may still come together at kill sites (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars are usually independent by the age of 24 months, however the age of dispersal or the social circumstances associated with it are poorly known (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Dispersal does not appear to be linked with the onset of sexual maturity, estimated at 24-30 months for females and 36-48 months for males (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Few data are available on dispersal distances however telemetry studies in the Brazilian Pantanal suggest that males disperse further than females (Quigley and Crawshaw 1992, Quigley and Crawshaw 2002). Dispersal through human-dominated landscapes may increase the likelihood of conflict with humans, particularly in areas where the habitat is highly fragmented (e.g. Sáenz and Carrillo 2002). The maximum age of last reproduction of a female recorded in the wild is 13 years (Brown and Lopez-Gonzalez 2001).<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013). Values for age at first reproduction and longevity were agreed to by experts at the 2012 National Action Plan workshop for Jaguars in Brazil, and can be used for generation length calculations as:<br/><br/>GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs<br/>R<sub>span</sub> = 15 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 11.5 yrs<br/><br/>Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/>Thus, GL = 11.5*0.29 +3.5 = 6.84 yrs for Jaguars.","Jaguar populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010a, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Nijhawan <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press), killing for trophies/illegal trade in body parts, pro-active or retaliatory killings associated with livestock depredation (Zimmermann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2008, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), and competition for wild meat with human hunters (Jorgenson and Redford 1993, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Deforestation rates in Latin America are the highest in the world together with tropical Africa (FAO forest update, D’Annunzio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em>et al.</em> 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Keuroghlian <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.","<u><strong>Historic assessment of Jaguar viability </strong></u><br/><strong>High chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that populations in 70% of the Jaguar range (over 6 million km²) had a high probability for survival. Most of that area consists of the Amazon Basin rainforest, and adjoining areas of the Pantanal and Gran Chaco (Torres <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Other areas considered by Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) to have a high probability for long-term Jaguar persistence included tropical moist lowland forest in Mesoamerica (the Selva Maya of Guatemala, Mexico and Belize) and a narrow strip of the Choco-Darien of Panama and Colombia to northern Honduras.<br/><br/><strong>Medium chance of survival: </strong>Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that Jaguar populations in 18% of the Jaguar range (1.6 million km²) had a medium probability of long-term survival. These areas are generally adjacent to the areas considered to have a high-probability probability of survival and include a large portion of the northern Cerrado, most of the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos, and the northern part of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. In Central America and Mexico, they include the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, southern Mexico, and the two eastern mountain ranges of Mexico, Sierra de Taumalipas and the Sierra Madre Oriental.<br/><br/><strong>Low chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) classified the remainder of Jaguar range (12%) as having a low probability for Jaguar survival, and of most urgent conservation concern. These areas include the Atlantic Tropical Forest and Cerrado of Brazil; parts of the Chaco in northern Argentina; the Gran Sabana of northern Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana; parts of the coastal dry forest in Venezuela; and the remaining range in Central America and Mexico.<br/><br/><strong><u>Current assessment of Jaguar populations</u></strong><br/><strong>Mexico</strong>: Jaguar densities in Mexico have been estimated from 0.75 to 6 adults per 100 km² (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). The Jaguar population in the Selva Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico was estimated in 2000 individuals (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Rodriguez-Soto <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In the Greater Lacadona Ecosystem in southern Mexico, Jaguar density was estimated at 1.7-4.6/100 km², with an estimated population of 62 to 168 Jaguars within the protected areas of this region (de la Torre and Medellín 2011). Overall, Mexico’s national Jaguar census estimated at 4,000-5,000 individuals in 2011 (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press). The northern and central areas of Mexico are however becoming increasingly isolated with Jaguars disappearing where they were previously still detected (Grigione <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Rosas-Rosas and Bender 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Central America</strong>: Estimates of Jaguar density from Mesoamerica from 27 studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 range from 0.74 to 11.2 /100 km², however most of the studies did not cover the minimum area to ensure unbiased density estimates (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Nevertheless, across these sites density estimates were higher in tropical moist forest than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest, and higher in national parks compared to those from other multiple use areas (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Densities in the Belizean Selva Maya rainforest were estimated at 7.5-8.8/100 km² (Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). Jaguar density estimates in the protected lowland moist tropical forest of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize range from 3.5 (+/- SE = 0.7) to 11.0 (+/- 3.1)/100 km² (Harmsen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Jaguar density was found to decline across the human-influenced landscape, a mosaic of unprotected forest, savannah, agriculture and settlements with distance from the protected forest (Foster 2008). The Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica and Panama support a Jaguar population, but the probability of long-term persistence is medium to low (Gonzalez-Maya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Similarly the Jaguar populations located in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are under a great pressure from deforestation and hunting (Petracca <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>South America</strong>: Jaguar density in the Brazilian Pantanal has been estimated as 6.6-6.7 /100 km², or 10.3-11.7/100 km² depending on the method used (telemetry versus camera traps, respectively, Soislao and Cavalcanti (2006). In the Bolivian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 2.8/100 km² (Madidi National Park Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004), and in the Colombian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 4.5/100 km² and 2.5/100 km² (Amacayacu National Park and unprotected areas respectively; Payan 2008). Estimates of Jaguar density are 2/100 km² in the savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, 3.5/100 km² in the semiarid scrub of the Caatinga, and 2.2/100 km² in the Atlantic Forest (Silveira 2004), and 2.2-5 per 100 km² in the Bolivian Gran Chaco (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). The Atlantic Forest subpopulation in Brazil has been estimated at 200+/- 80 adults (Leite <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). Jaguar populations in the Chaco region of northern Argentina and Brazil, and the Brazilian Caatinga, are low-density and highly threatened by livestock ranching and persecution (Altrichter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, T. de Oliveira pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Historic methodological biases</strong></u><br/>Unfortunately, many of these reported density estimates have inadequate sample sizes of area or capture and recaptures. Careful reviews have shown that these estimates tend to be biased positively rather than negatively (Foster and Harmsen 2012, Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Tobler and Powell 2013). This means that many of the older publications from before 2010 tended to overestimate densities at an unknown quantity. It also means that previous assessments have been overly optimistic about Jaguar status throughout their range.<br/><br/><u><strong>Subpopulation status</strong></u><br/>De la Torre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2017) identified 34 Jaguar subpopulations where there is little likelihood of demographic or genetic exchange, and assessed each against Red List criteria. Overall, 97% met the criteria for Critically Endangered (25 subpopulations) or Endangered (eight subpopulations) (see Figure 3a-e in the Supplementary Material). The large Amazonia subpopulation, estimated to hold 89% of the total species population (57,000 out of 64,000), was assessed as Least Concern.",Decreasing,"The Jaguar is the largest cat of the Americas, and the only living representative of the genus <em>Panthera </em>in the New World (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Historically it ranged from the southwestern US (where there are still some vagrants close to the Mexican border) through the Amazon basin to the Rio Negro in Argentina (McCain and Childs 2008, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) (updated with the collaboration of 44 experts—see the lists of Assessors and Contributors and the Assessment Rationale section for a thorough description) is estimated at 9.02 million km², with its stronghold the rainforest of the Amazon basin, which comprises 57% of its total EOO. The Jaguar has been virtually eliminated from much of the drier northern parts of its range—Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and extreme northern Sonora state in Mexico—( Johnson and Van Pelt 2016), as well as northern Brazil, the pampas scrub grasslands of Argentina and throughout Uruguay (de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016). In 2002, Jaguars were estimated to occupy only about 46% of its historic range (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). With our improved knowledge of Jaguar range (see the Assessment Rationale and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), this percentage is set at 51% currently.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) defined the most important areas for conservation of viable Jaguar populations (Jaguar Conservation Units or JCUs). These 51 areas cover 44.49 million km², or 49% of Jaguar range according to present calculations.","Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

Specific conservation plans for the species have been developed in Mexico, Panama, Honduras, and Brazil. <br/><br/>With habitat fragmentation a major threat, and taxonomic research suggesting little significant differences among Jaguar populations, an ambitious program has been launched to conserve a continuous north to south habitat corridor through the species range (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010).<br/><br/>Addressing livestock management and animals that prey on livestock is a high priority for conservation efforts in many Jaguar range countries due to the impact of retaliatory killing of Jaguars and other predators.<br/><br/><strong><u>Jaguar Conservation Actions</u><br/></strong>The following is a list of actions that a variety of Jaguar range countries have put in place to enhance Jaguar conservation. <br/><ol><li>Respond to reports of livestock depredation, and provide advice and assistance to improve livestock management practices, thereby reducing depredation and associated retaliatory killings of Jaguars; </li><li>Understand and address the hunting of Jaguar prey for sport, commercial and subsistence uses, and raise awareness about the laws governing the hunting of wildlife and the need for adopting sustainable hunting practices;</li><li>Monitor and safe-guarding Jaguar core populations, Jaguar Conservation Units, or JCUs (see Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010);</li><li>Maintain national and regional population connectivity through the identification of corridors for Jaguar movement between JCUs and applying conservation actions in those corridors through the engagement of corridor stakeholders as in the development of a Conservation Action Plan for the Central Belize Corridor (Kay <em>et al.</em> 2015);</li><li>Develop national, regional and local monitoring programs for Jaguars and their prey.</li></ol>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

In addition, the species is widely distributed and occurs in many protected areas.","Fishers inhabit upland and lowland forests, including coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forests. They occur primarily in dense coniferous or mixed forests, including early successional forest with dense overhead cover (Thomas 1993). They generally avoid areas with little forest cover or significant human disturbance. The Fisher is adapted for climbing but is primarily ground-dwelling. It is a generalised predator with major prey of small to medium-sized mammals and birds, and carrion (Powell 1981).","During the 19th and early 20th centuries the Fisher declined over most of its range because of excessive fur trapping and habitat destruction through logging. Aubry and Lewis (2003) stated that over-trapping appears to have been the primary initial cause of Fisher population losses in south-western Oregon. The high value of the skins, the ease of trapping Fishers (Powell 1993), year-round accessibility in the low to mid-elevation coniferous forests, and the lack of trapping regulations resulted in heavy trapping pressure on Fishers in the late 1800s and early 1900s (Aubry and Lewis 2003). Timber harvest can fragment Fisher habitat, reduce it in size, or render the forest structure unsuitable for Fishers.","Densities in preferred habitat are about one Fisher per 2.6 to 7.5 km²&#160;(Coulter 1966, Kelly 1977). The total population size is unknown but probably is at least in the low hundreds of thousands; for example, the harvest in North America during the 1983-1984 trapping season was about 20,000 (Novak <em>et al</em>. 1987), and the average in the 1960s and 1970s was about 13,000 (Strickland <em>et al</em>. 1982).",Unknown,"Fisher has a&#160;large range in northern North America:&#160;from Quebec, the Maritime Provinces, and New England west across boreal Canada to south-eastern Alaska, south through the western mountains to Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and California, and formerly south to Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, and North Carolina (Lewis, J.C., Powell, R.A. and Zielinski, W.J. 2012). Extirpation from southern portion of range, mainly because of&#160;habitat loss, has been counteracted by recent natural and human-aided range expansions in the eastern U.S.; adequate population data are unavailable for much of the range, but the species currently is regarded as secure.","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,There are currently efforts underway to implement a conservation strategy to reintroduce the Fisher into its former range along the Pacific Coast.

Based on the best available data, the total number of wolves in the EU 28 Members States is likely to be in the order of 13,000-14,000, and the number of wolves in geographic Europe (excluding Russia) is likely to exceed 17,000, a marked increase over the last ten years. Consequently, the species qualifies as Least Concern at both the European and EU 28 level. The quantity and quality of data on population size and structure varies greatly between European countries: see Appendix 1 for an explanation of the methods used to obtain the numbers for each subpopulation.<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Near Threatened. The Iberian subpopulation&#160;is large (about 2,500 wolves) and expanding towards the south and east. It does not qualify for the category Vulnerable and it is maintained in the Near Threatened category because of the fragmentation in management regimes, the lack of a subpopulation-level management plan, the occurrence of largely unpredictable events of human persecution (poison, shooting, etc.) that may threaten the subpopulation&#160;at the local level and the near isolation of some of its subpopulation&#160;segments. Wolf presence in the Sierra Morena area is limited to few signs (last recorded in 2014): the species is below functional levels and is possibly locally extinct.<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>Vulnerable (D1). The Alpine subpopulation&#160;was founded based on a recent expansion of the Italian peninsula wolf subpopulation&#160;and has grown rapidly and steadily (10-20% /year) to about 420-550 wolves in 2015/2016. It may be estimated to be 550-700 in 2017/2018. However, it has limited genetic and demographic contacts with the adjacent source subpopulation&#160;in the Apennines (Fabbri <em>et al.</em> 2007), meaning that it qualifies as a discrete subpopulation under IUCN Red List guidelines. Its relatively small size with an estimated at least 330-415 mature individuals, its relative isolation and dispersion over a large range justifies its assessment in category Vulnerable (D1).<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Near Threatened. The Italian peninsula wolf subpopulation&#160;is estimated to be 1,100-2,400 individuals. The shape of the range is narrow and elongated, mainly restricted to the Apennines mountains. The subpopulation&#160;has limited exchange with the subpopulation&#160;of the western-central Alps and recent genetic evidence indicates a flow of genes only in the direction toward the Alps. In spite of the recent increase in numbers and range, the Italian peninsula wolf subpopulation&#160;is locally vulnerable to local extermination from human pressures (poison, shooting) and the locally high prevalence of wolf-dog hybridization. The stochastic nature of these events suggests that the subpopulation&#160;may easily reverse its current favourable status. If considered at the lowest limit of the estimate (1,100), the subpopulation&#160;would qualify for the category Vulnerable (D1) as the number of mature individuals would be less than 1,000. However, it is likely that the true size of the subpopulation&#160;is between the upper and lower estimates, hence the use of Near Threatened.<br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>Least Concern. This wolf subpopulation&#160;does not qualify for any Threatened categories because of its large size (c.4,000 animals) and wide distribution. However, several parts of the range may be subject to excessive pressure from lethal control and poorly regulated hunting. In many countries the data quality is poor, and management plans are poorly developed or absent.<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>Least Concern. This large wolf subpopulation&#160;(c.3,460-3,840 animals) appears to be maintaining its conservation status mainly due to the management implemented in Romania. Some of the peripheral areas of the range may be subject to excessive hunting and poaching pressure (e.g. Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria), limiting the recovery of the subpopulation&#160;in those areas (Kutal <em>et al.</em> 2016) and may require appropriate conservation measures to limit mortality. In other countries, wolves are fully protected (e.g. Poland and the Czech Republic). These peripheral areas are under threat because of completely different management regimes implemented in neighbouring countries (Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) (Nowak <em>et al.</em> 2008). To ensure the viability of these peripheral parts of the Carpathian subpopulation&#160;it is important to coordinate management at the international level. <br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>Least Concern. The relatively large number of wolves (c.1,713–2,240) in the EU members (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) and the continuity of its range into Russia and Belarus support its assessment in the category of Least Concern. A large part of the subpopulation&#160;is fully protected in eastern Poland (1,040 wolves). However, the portions of the subpopulation&#160;in some of the Baltic States are intensively hunted with high hunting quotas at 40-50% and may require conservation measures to ensure their long-term persistence. <br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>Near Threatened. The total subpopulation, shared by Finland and Russian Karelia is estimated to be 750 individuals and would qualify for Vulnerable. However, the Karelian subpopulation&#160;is generally considered to have connections with the very large Russian subpopulation, and there could potentially be a rescue effect, so the subpopulation-level assessment is downgraded by one step to Near Threatened. The total subpopulation&#160;size&#160;in Finland is small (c.200 mature individuals) and it would qualify for the category of Endangered (D1) if it was isolated. The number of wolves in Russian Karelia is not well known but is likely to be in the order of 500 and it may be declining as a result of excessive persecution. The degree of fragmentation is not known. Very little information is currently available on the status of the wolf in Russian Karelia, and this subpopulation&#160;should be reassessed if any new relevant data becomes available.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Vulnerable (D1). The subpopulation&#160;size is well known (430, CI = 340-559) and the estimated number of mature individuals (c.260) justifies the category Vulnerable. The subpopulation&#160;has low genetic variability due to a small number of founders and has little genetic exchange with the Karelian subpopulation. The management policies (low population goals and high hunting/control quotas) in Norway dramatically affect the future conservation prospects of the overall subpopulation, and there is no common management plan at the subpopulation&#160;level.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European<br/></strong>Vulnerable (D1). This subpopulation&#160;has grown very rapidly since 2000 and it is now estimated in the order of 780-1,030 wolves. The estimated number of mature individuals is 468-620, justifying the category Vulnerable. In Germany, the number of mature individuals has been estimated to be at least 150-160 (BfN 2017). In the German part of the subpopulation, the expansion is mainly occurring in a northwest direction, whereas the expansion to the southwest is taken place slowly. Although the geographic gap between the Central European subpopulation&#160;and the Baltic subpopulation&#160;is nearly closed the genetic exchange between both subpopulations&#160;appears to be limited (Pilot <em>et al.</em> 2006, Hulva <em>et al.</em> 2018).","Wolves live in diverse habitat types and their broad distribution ranges show the species' adaptability to the most extreme (both in terms of natural and anthropogenic factors) habitat conditions. The wolf's habitat has been prosaically described as anywhere where humans do not kill it and where there is something to eat. Where wolves depend on wild ungulate prey, their habitat is that of their prey. Habitat quality should thus be interpreted in terms of human disturbance, prey densities and range size. In general, large forest areas are particularly suitable for wolves in Europe, although wolves are not exclusively a forest species. The wolf has a very diversified diet and is a true generalist that feeds opportunistically on what is most available in its habitat. The wolf’s diet may include large prey, such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar, as well as small mammals and birds, invertebrates, vegetation and carcasses. Diet composition throughout the geographic range and seasonal variations depends on the relative abundance of potential prey, as well as accessibility and availability. A wolf typically requires 3-5 kg of meat per day, although it can fast for several days when food is not readily available.","Human intolerance is perhaps the most important limiting factor facing wolves in Europe today. Fear, misunderstanding and the fact that wolves do kill livestock have prompted an uneasy relationship with people in many areas, leading to direct conflicts and retaliatory/preventative persecution. In some countries, poorly regulated hunting of wolves poses a threat, while in others licenses for killing wolves are issued irrespective of biological understanding. Poaching is widespread and probably represents the most important mortality factor for the wolf in many parts of Europe. Wolf depredation on domestic animals has been a problem since man progressed from hunter/gatherer to farmer, and although the numbers of sheep or cattle taken are, as a percentage, very low, livestock depredation remains the primary reason for persecuting wolves. Wolves have also become symbolic of wider issues of social change facing rural life, such that the politics of wolf management has become very controversial and intertwined with multiple other issues. It also appears that institutions in many countries are ill-equipped to handle the biological and socio-politic challenges of wolf management. Human land use is the most significant threat to wolf habitat. Wolves can live close to humans but they require safe areas in which to retreat. This is not always considered in land use planning in wolf areas and the small, fragmented subpopulations&#160;in western Europe can result in animals moving into unsuitable habitat. Although wolves show a good ability to cross linear infrastructure like highways and railroads, these structures can be associated with wolf mortality and there is a need to ensure wildlife permeability in all infrastructure projects. Wolf-dog hybridization has been increasingly reported in most European countries but only appears to be a major issue in Italy and other Mediterranean countries because of poor dog management practices. Legislation and public attitudes towards dog management and dog control policies impede the implementation of a coordinated effort to manage the occurrence and spread of hybridization (Ciucci 2012). Specific threats to different European wolf subpopulations are as follows:<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Illegal killing is still common (estimated to account for 50% of the total mortality) and poison baits are still used. Illegal killing appears the primary cause of the (virtual) disappearance of the Sierra Morena subpopulation. <br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>Documented causes of mortality include car or train accidents and poaching. Several cases of illegal killing have been reported in France and Italy, and conflicts with hunters and farmers are constantly reported. Both France and the Regional Government of Piemonte have been carrying out extensive and continuous research and monitoring of the wolf subpopulation&#160;and damages to livestock, and excellent data is available for management purposes. The number of livestock depredations in the Italian Alps is decreasing, despite the increase in wolf numbers, due to the large efforts in the implementation of preventive practices promoted by the authorities. Although wolf presence is still far from being accepted by local farmers and livestock breeders, the general attitude is improving (<a href=""http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/"">LIFE WOLFALPS</a>).<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;is protected on paper, but the law is poorly enforced with illegal killing remaining common (and rarely prosecuted) throughout the range. Poison baits are increasingly used against dogs, foxes and wolves. Hybridization with dogs has been documented and, in certain areas of central Italy, it appears to account for at least 40% of the total wolf subpopulation&#160;(Verardi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Ciucci 2012). <br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>There is an enormous diversity in threats occurring throughout the range. Poorly regulated legal hunting and illegal killing, often with the use of poison) are taking an unknown number of wolves throughout most of the range. Other pressures that are commonly reported include; habitat fragmentation due to the construction of fenced highways and a shortage of wild prey. In many countries, there is very limited knowledge about wolf ecology or status (Huber <em>et al.</em> 2002, Iliopoulos 2005, Trbojević 2016).<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>Poison baits and illegal killing are widespread throughout the range. In Ukraine, wolves are treated as a pest species. Poorly regulated legal hunting in Slovakia hinders the recovery of the wolf in the Czech-Slovak borderlands (Kutal <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>The Baltic subpopulation&#160;is subject to hunter harvest in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Access to good quality population monitoring data is, therefore, crucial to ensure that quotas are set at sustainable levels. There is room for substantial improvement in monitoring effort in Latvia and Lithuania.<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>The main threat to wolves in this region is killing by humans. In south-central Finland, wolves cause very limited damage to livestock, but predation on domestic dogs and a perception of competition for game species is the most frequent impact that causes strong resentment from the public. In the north of Finland, potential conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer herding effectively prevent its expansion.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Due to the small number of founders the inbreeding coefficient is very high, on average higher than for full siblings mating (Liberg <em>et al.</em> 2005). Predation on domestic dogs, sheep and semi-domestic reindeer are the most frequent damages that cause continuing debate on wolf conservation. In the north of Sweden and Norway, potential conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer herding effectively prevent its expansion. Norway has a restrictive policy that officially prevents further expansion.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>The main cause of documented mortality in Germany is traffic accidents (70%). Cases of illegal killing have been reported in Poland and Germany, and complaints from hunters and farmers are constantly reported from Germany. The implementation of livestock protection measures in Germany does not keep track with the fast population growth providing the ground for permanent and growing conflict with farmers, whereas such conflicts appear to be much less in the Polish subpopulation&#160;segment. The habitat is also very heavily modified and fragmented. Coordination between the federal states of Germany and between Germany and neighbouring countries is crucial.","Because of the diversity in climate, topography, vegetation, patterns of human settlement and historical development of wolf range, wolf populations in various parts of the original range vary dramatically in&#160; density Wolf densities normally vary from about one per 12 km² to less than one per 120 km² (Mech and Boitani 2003). The overall European wolf population can be viewed as a large metapopulation with several distinct fragments, although dispersal could theoretically connect almost all fragments, and connections are being re-established in many areas. Following the bottleneck of the 1960s and 1970s, the European wolf population is generally increasing in number and expanding its distribution range. However, some European populations are still small and not all have more than 1,000 animals (see below for specific details). Dispersing animals can potentially be found anywhere in mainland Europe, for example as revealed by the appearance of transient individuals in the Netherlands and Belgium. The total number of wolves in the EU 28 is likely to be in the order of 13-14,000; some of the subpopulations&#160;are continuous with wolf populations living in countries outside the EU. The number of wolves in geographic Europe (excluding Russia) is likely to exceed 17,000.<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Subpopulation&#160;size: 2,160-2,880 wolves. The Iberian wolf (<em>Canis lupus signatus</em>) may be a distinct subspecies. After the population reduction up to the 1960s, it has increased dramatically since the 1970s and has been stable or slightly increasing in the last ten years and expanding its range across central Spain. The subpopulation&#160;occupies most of north-western Iberia and is expanding south and east after having crossed the Duero River in Spain. There are two distinct subpopulation&#160;segments within this subpopulation. The largest is that north of the Duero River&#160;in both Spain and Portugal. South of the Duero in Portugal there is a small subpopulation&#160;segment of around 50 wolves which has only limited exchange of animals with the segments north of the Duero in Portugal and east to the Spanish segment south of the Duero.<br/><br/>The nearest wolf subpopulation&#160;is in the western Alps and connections between the two are non-existent or limited to exceptional cases. In the Pyrenees (regions of Cataluña and Aragón) there are currently a few non-reproducing wolves that have been genetically identified as members of the Alpine subpopulation&#160;from where they are assumed to have dispersed naturally (Alvares <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Blanco and Cortés 2012, Jiménez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, López-Bao <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018, Torres and Fonseca 2016).<br/><br/>The isolated Sierra Morena subpopulation&#160;in southern Spain has (virtually) disappeared.<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>Subpopulation&#160;size: c.550-700 wolves. This subpopulation&#160;is of Italian Apennines origin and all wolves share the same distinctive Italian genetic haplotype. Individual wolves dispersing from the Apennines first colonized the Alps in 1992 and succeeded in establishing a permanent and expanding population which shows a highly dynamic spatial pattern spreading towards the west and north (and then to the east along the Alpine arc). Dispersing animals are regularly reported in Switzerland where there are about 30 wolves. More recently (2015) dispersing individuals from Dinaric-Balkans and the western Alps formed a pack in the central Alps. The total number in 2015/2016 was estimated to be about 420-550 wolves (65 packs and 12 pairs; WAG 2018, Marucco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), and in 2017/18 it may be estimated to be 550-700, increasing on average by 10-20% per year. The genetic continuity with the Apennines subpopulation&#160;has been recently assessed at 1.25-2.5 individuals per generation, all of them moving from the Apennines to the Alpine subpopulation&#160;(Fabbri <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). In 2005, a young radio-marked wolf dispersed more than 1300 km from Parma (Italy) to Nice (France), providing a demonstration of the natural dispersal along the northern Apennines range to the Alps. In spite of the continuity between the two subpopulations, their ecological and socio-economic contexts are sufficiently different to justify a separation into two functional population units for management purposes (Marucco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017, LCIE 2007, <a href=""http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/Quoi-de-neuf-Le-Bulletin-d-information-du-reseau-loup-download130"">http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/Quoi-de-neuf-Le-Bulletin-d-information-du-reseau-loup-download130</a>, <a href=""http://www.kora.ch/"">http://www.kora.ch/</a>, <a href=""http://carmen.carmencarto.fr/38/Loup_presence_communale.map"">http://carmen.carmencarto.fr/38/Loup_presence_communale.map</a>, <a href=""http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/"">http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/</a>).<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 1,070-2,400 wolves. The subpopulation&#160;was described in 1921 (Altobello 1921) and confirmed in 1999 (Nowak 1999) as a distinct subspecies (<em>Canis lupus italicus</em>). It is genetically recognized by the presence of a unique mtDNA haplotype. After the population bottleneck of the 1960s, when total numbers were estimated to be about 100 animals, the subpopulation&#160;has steadily recovered throughout the Apennines and expanded into the western Alps. In 2006, the subpopulation&#160;was estimated to be 500-800 wolves, but recent estimates (2017) suggest numbers to be 1,100-2,400 with an estimate of 1600 probably being close to the real number. However, the difference between the 2006 and 2017 estimates is also due to improved estimation methods. The nearest subpopulation&#160;(apart from that in the western Alps, see above) is in Slovenia (Dinaric-Balkan subpopulation). However, a large portion of the central Alps and the agricultural Po River valley effectively separate the Italian peninsula and the Dinaric subpopulations&#160;(Galaverni <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Boitani and Salvatori 2016).<br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 3,750-4,000 wolves. There is continuity of the subpopulation&#160;and suitable habitats throughout the range although the subpopulation&#160;might be significantly sub-structured within this massive elongated range. Although the subpopulation&#160;is estimated to number almost 4,000 individuals, locally the densities may vary greatly and its overall demographic trend is unknown. In Croatia and Slovenia, the subpopulation&#160;has recovered significantly following improved management in the 1990s. In Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Trbojević 2016) it is likely that the subpopulation&#160;has decreased in recent few years due to overharvesting. To the north, the subpopulation&#160;has no functional contact with the nearest subpopulation&#160;in Italy, although dispersing animals are reported in Austria and one dispersing male successfully established a pair and a territory in Veneto (northern Italy) with a mate from the western-central Alps subpopulation. To the east, the subpopulation&#160;may exchange individuals with the large wolf subpopulation&#160;of the Carpathians which extends into northern Bulgaria and eastern Serbia (Iliopoulos 1999; Kusak <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005; Štrbenac <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005; Jeremic <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, 2015, 2016; Trbojević 2016).<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>This subpopulation&#160;is estimated to number c.3,460-3,840 animals, the majority of them living in Romania and Ukraine. The difference between the 2006 and 2017 estimates is partly due to improved estimation methods. Slovakia hosts about 300-400 wolves and southern Poland contributes with good wolf habitat in the areas along its southern borders (the wolf subpopulation&#160;in the Polish Carpathians is about 380 individuals). In the past, there was natural continuity with wolves living in northern Poland and Belarus, but this link is now constrained by large areas where wolves have been exterminated. Nevertheless, it is likely that some level of genetic exchange still occurs with the Dinaric-Balkan subpopulation&#160;in western Bulgaria / eastern Serbia, and with the Baltic subpopulation&#160;in eastern-central Poland (Okarma 1993; CLCP 1997-98, 2000, 2001, 2002; Smietana and Wajda 1997, Okarma <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Shkvyrya 2008, Cazacu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Pirga <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Rigg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>Subopulation size: about 1,713–2,240 wolves in EU countries and an additional 1,000-1,500 in Belarus and 1,600 in the adjacent Russian oblasts. At the start of the 20th-century the subpopulation was greatly reduced, but still widely present, these increased during and after World War 1. In the period between the wars, populations were greatly reduced again, but recovered to peak levels during and after World War II, only to be heavily persecuted in the 1950s such that they again reached very low levels in the 1960s and early 1970s. The populations appear to have then increased, peaking in the early 1990s – before being reduced again in the late 1990s. This subpopulation&#160;is the westernmost portion of the large Russian subpopulation&#160;and it ultimately connects with the wolf range of Russian Karelia. In Poland, although the distribution is not continuous, it is highly likely that dispersal regularly connects the Baltic and Central European subpopulation&#160;(Bluzma 2000, Sidorovich <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Linnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Nowak and Mysłajek 2016, Bragina <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018, Ozolins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Kawata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Geldon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 204-234 wolves in Finland and about 750 including Finland and Russian Karelia. Following widespread control of the subpopulation&#160;in the first part of 20th century, the subpopulation&#160;recovered after the 1980s and 1990s. The current estimates are based on counts of family groups in Finland and the subpopulation&#160;is expanding. In Russian Karelia, wolf numbers appear to be stable.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 430 (CI = 340-559) wolves. The subpopulation&#160;derives from a pair that immigrated from Finland and first reproduced in Sweden in 1983. A third immigrant in 1991 boosted the reproduction and the subpopulation&#160;is now estimated to be 440 wolves (about 85 in Norway). The subpopulation&#160;has been steadily increasing from 1983-2001, then slightly decreased in 2002-3, and then is increasing again. There is evidence of limited further genetic exchanges with the Finnish/Russian wolf subpopulation&#160;after 1991. Immigration from Russia / Finland is the only possible mechanism to increase the genetic variability of the subpopulation&#160;which is critical for its future viability (Chapron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016; Svensson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017; Wabakken <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016).<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 780-1030 wolves. Wolves were exterminated in Germany during the 19th century, but individuals that were dispersing from Poland were shot occasionally throughout the 20th century. In the late-1990s a pack began breeding in Saxony, and there are currently 60 packs breeding regularly and 13 pairs. Wolves in western Poland have had a dynamic history of persecution and heavy harvest with periods of total absence and very low numbers in 1950 - 1990s, but since 2000 the subpopulation&#160;started to recover from immigrants originating in eastern Poland and presently there are about 60 packs in the region. Three packs were confirmed in the Czech Republic in 2016 /2017 (Kutal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017, Hulva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018). This subpopulation&#160;is highly dynamic and dispersing animals have reached Denmark (1 confirmed pack), Belgium and the Netherlands. Connections exist to the Baltic subpopulation, but the distances are in the order of up to several hundred kilometres (Fechter and Storch 2015; Reinhardt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015; Sunde and Olsen 2017; Nowak and Myslajek 2016, 2017; Nowak <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).",Increasing,"Historically wolves were found over most of Europe, including the British Isles. By the mid-20th century, their range was greatly reduced to remnants in northwest Iberia, central Italy, parts of the Baltics, the Carpathians, and the mountain areas of the Balkans. In the last 50 years, their range has greatly expanded with wolf presence being recorded in all continental European countries (with the exception of Luxemburg). The European wolf subpopulation&#160;is currently a large meta-population with several distinct subpopulations, which can be described as follows (Chapron <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014):<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian </strong><br/>Wolves are found in the northwestern quadrant of Iberia (both Spain and Portugal). The Iberian subpopulation&#160;does not extend as far east as to the Pyrenees (although some individuals are now colonising from the Alps, via France). Wolves are expanding southwards and are now found on both banks of the Duro River in both Spain and Portugal. The subpopulation&#160;segment in the Sierra Morena mountains in southern Spain seems to be near or at extinction (Blanco and Cortés 2002, Alvares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Blanco and Cortés 2012, Jiménez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016, López-Bao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2018).<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;occupies a large area that includes most of the Western Alps in France and Italy, many wolf packs territories being transboundary along the French-Italian border, and occupies large areas of south-eastern France up to the Massif Central. Increasing numbers of wolves are found in Switzerland as far as the canton of Grisons. Numbers are rapidly building up in Veneto and Trentino and will likely expand through most of the central Alps (<a href=""http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/Quoi-de-neuf-Le-Bulletin-d-information-du-reseau-loup-download130"">Bulletin d’information du réseau Loup</a>, <a href=""http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/"">LIFE WOLFALPS</a>, KORA (<a href=""https://www.kora.ch/"">Carnivore Ecology and Wildlife Management</a>), Cubaynes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Marescot <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Duchamp <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, WAG 2014, Schnidrig <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). The first packs based on individuals from the Alps and animals from the Dinaric-Balkan subpopulation&#160;are forming in the easternmost part of its range.<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Wolves occur in the whole Apennines range from Liguria to Calabria (Aspromonte) and extending into northern Lazio and central western Tuscany (provinces of Siena, Grosseto and Pisa) (Ciucci and Boitani 1998, Boitani 2003, Galaverni <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Boitani and Salvatori 2016).<br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;covers a vast area from Slovenia in the north to central Greece in the south and it includes the whole Dinaric mountain range through Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, western Serbia and Kosovo, Montenegro, FYR Macedonia, Albania, and western and southern parts of Bulgaria. <br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;extends across several countries, from Northern Bulgaria and Eastern Serbia, Romania, south-western Ukraine, Slovakia and southern Poland. Small numbers of wolves are also present in the Czech Republic and Hungary on the periphery of the distribution (Kutal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016, 2017).<br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>This subpopulation&#160;covers eastern Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, northern Ukraine and the neighbouring parts of Russian (including the oblasts of Kaliningrad, Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, Tver, Smolensk, Bryansk, Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod and Orel).<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>Wolves occur in Finland (mainly in the southern half of the country) and Russian Karelia. The Karelian wolf subpopulation&#160;is the western extreme of a large Russian subpopulation&#160;which is presumed to be continuous across most of the country.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>The distribution range of the subpopulation&#160;is in central Sweden and, to a lesser extent, in southeastern Norway. It is spreading slowly toward southern Sweden but is being prevented from expansion in Norway because of government policy.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>This subpopulation&#160;is expanding rapidly into the central European lowlands from its core in the western half of Poland and the eastern part of Germany. A few packs are also found in the Czech Republic. Individuals have dispersed as far as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark (which has one established pack).",The species is sometimes hunted for sport. In some&#160;countries the species is also important for the skin market and the pelt&#160;industry.,Terrestrial,"By default, the species is strictly protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix II) and Habitats Directive (Annex II and IV), meaning that wolves may not be killed except under strict conditions, and key wolf habitat must be protected as part of the European protected area networks Natura 2000 (Habitats Directive, Annex II) and Emerald Network (Bern Convention, Appendix II). However, there are many national and regional exceptions. Regarding the Habitats Directive:<br/><br/>1) in Spain, wolves north of the Duero river are not subject to Annexes II or IV, but covered instead by the more flexible regime of Annex V, which permits harvesting – and it remains uncertain which regimes apply to wolves east of the Duero river (Trouwborst 2014);<br/>2) in Greece, wolves north of 39°N have a similar status (only Annex V);<br/>3) in the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) wolves have a similar status (only Annex V);<br/>4) in Finland, wolves occurring in the reindeer herding area in northern Finland fall under Annex V; wolves outside the reindeer herding area fall under Annex IV but not Annex II;<br/>5) In Bulgaria and Slovakia, wolves are subject to Annex II and Annex V;<br/>6) In Poland, wolves are also on Annex II and Annex V of the Habitats Directive, but strictly protected under the national legislations and government has not opened for harvest.<br/><br/>A similar set of diverse situations exist under the Bern Convention, with some countries having taken total exceptions (e.g. Finland) and others treating it as Appendix III instead of Appendix II.<br/><br/>In general, habitat restoration is required in some key areas (especially in southern Europe) in the form of fostering a healthy prey base, and encouraging wolves to move back into their former range where appropriate. Conflicts with humans need to be addressed by involving local people in wolf management plans and through education programmes to increase people's understanding of wolf biology and behaviour. Problems resulting from wolves preying on domestic animals need to be tackled by livestock protection schemes and compensation systems. In general there is a need for innovative governance regimes that balance the need for large scale (international level) coordination of management with the need to give local stakeholders a voice into local level solutions to local problems. Finally, there is a need to increase investment in population monitoring in many countries in southern and eastern Europe where the largest subpopulations&#160;live. Details of specific conservation measures for European wolf subpopulations&#160;are given below: <br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Wolves are fully protected in Portugal and south of the Duero river in Spain. North of the Duero in Spain, wolves can be game species under various management regimes depending on the legislation of 8 autonomous regional governments. The autonomous regions are gradually approving their action plans. Asturias has a wolf management plan and Galicia and Castilla y León also have approved their plans. However, management coordination among the regional governments and between Spain and Portugal is very limited. By allowing the (virtual) extinction of the Sierra Morena subpopulation&#160;in southern Spain, Spain has violated its obligations under the Habitats Directive’s Annex II and Annex IV regimes, and EU law requires the Spanish authorities to restore this subpopulation&#160;(Trouwborst 2014).<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;is fully protected under the French, Italian and Swiss law. In France and Switzerland, the national Action Plans include provisions for legal take of a few wolves under strict conditions in response to damages on livestock. The three countries signed (2006) a formal agreement of cooperation for the management of the entire subpopulation, recognizing that the biological subpopulation&#160;needs to be managed through a common and accepted approach, but the agreement has not produced any concrete cooperation at the administrative or political levels. <br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Fully protected by a national law, with damage compensation provided by 14 different regional laws. Compensation is paid for livestock lost to wolf predation, but the effectiveness of compensation programs has never been assessed and it is increasingly questioned. Apart from formal protection the subpopulation&#160;is not actively managed. The species occurs in several protected areas throughout its range but the size of these areas is far too small to protect any viable subpopulations. In spite of formal protection, illegal killings are estimated to take a substantial portion of the subpopulation&#160;every year (up to 15-20%). A national Action Plan setting the broad strategic ground for management has been under discussion for several years (2015-2017) but has not been approved because of disagreement between the national and regional governments (Boitani and Salvatori 2016). <br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>Management is fragmented by multiple national laws. Most of the range is also outside the EU and therefore not bound by the protection of the Habitats Directive, although all range countries are now Bern Convention signatories. It is a game species in almost all countries, except for Slovenia, Croatia, Albania and Greece south of 39° latitude where wolves are fully protected. In Slovenia and Croatia, an effective Action Plan is in place and implemented (Štrbenac <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, <a href=""http://www.mop.gov.si/fileadmin/mop.gov.si/pageuploads/podrocja/velike_zveri/akcijski_nacrt_upravljanja_volk_2013_2017.pdf"">http://www.mop.gov.si/fileadmin/mop.gov.si/pageuploads/podrocja/velike_zveri/akcijski_nacrt_upravljanja_volk_2013_2017.pdf</a>) but no plans exists for any of the other countries. With the exception of Slovenia and Croatia, in general, law enforcement is weak or totally absent, institutions in several of the countries are not fully functional, there is very limited monitoring and research, and wildlife management structures for regulating hunter harvest of the prey base are poorly developed. There is a major need for investment in institution building in these countries.<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>In Slovakia wolves are a game species with a hunting season; in Poland and the Czech Republic they are strictly protected by national laws; in Romania they are legally protected, but are managed as a de facto game species with hunting quotas decided yearly; in Ukraine wolves are neither a game species nor protected (often treated as “pest” species, with bounties of c.20 Euro per individual) (Salvatori <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is a need to improve monitoring, especially in Slovakia, and ensure that quotas and seasons are scaled with respect to realistic population estimates. <br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>Wolves have been strictly protected in Poland since 1998, but are harvested in the three Baltic States (EU Habitats and Species Directive Appendix V) and in neighbouring Belarus and Ukraine. There is a new action plan for the conservation of the wolf in Latvia (2017). In all countries, there is a need to ensure that monitoring is effective at detecting trends in subpopulation&#160;development so that hunting quotas and seasons can be adjusted accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>In Finland, wolves occurring in the reindeer herding area fall under Annex V of the Habitats Directive; those outside the reindeer herding area fall under Annex IV. Finland has a National Management Plan that includes removal of some wolves under controlled circumstances. In Russian Karelia, wolves are killed throughout the range and at any time. In spite of the small number of wolves, Finland has approved a plan to maintain the subpopulation&#160;within the maximum of 25 packs. The discontinuous flow of dispersing wolves from Russia allow a reasonable but cautiously positive forecast on the conservation of this subpopulation. Illegal killing of wolves remains a major problem in Finland. There are also widespread social and political conflicts that centre on wolf conservation.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Wolves are fully protected in Sweden and Norway; however, Norway applies both a zoning system and operates with very low management goal that restricts wolves to a small area (c. 5% of the country) along the border with Sweden and prevents population expansion. Both Norway and Sweden provide full compensation for damages. Both countries greatly restrict the presence of wolves in the reindeer herding areas that cover the northern part of the peninsula. The main issue for long-term viability of the subpopulation&#160;is inbreeding, which can only be improved by facilitating the movement of wolves through the northern reindeer herding areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Social and political conflicts around wolf management are intense.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>Wolves are functionally protected in all countries. In Germany, conservation is implemented by the local authority but there is a certain degree of coordination at the federal level. In Poland, wolves are strictly protected since 1995. The main threats stem from the intense social and political conflicts around wolf management.",Palearctic,,false,false,Europe
145266191,12519,Lynx lynx,Least Concern,,2018,2018-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)<br/>EU 28 regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT)</p>  <p>The Eurasian Lynx is abundant in the northern and eastern part of its range. There are 8,000-9,000 lynx (number of individuals) present in Europe&#160;excluding&#160;Russia and Belarus (LCIE in prep., Chapron<em> et al.</em> 2014) and this number has been stable since the last regional assessment in 2007. The European subpopulation doubles to 17,000-18,000 individuals when taking European Russia into account where in 2013 roughly 9,200 lynx were estimated (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl) and with help of V.V. Rozhnov 2014). Consequently, the species is classed as Least Concern at the European level.</p>  <p>The lynx population within the EU Member States remains small. With an estimated 7,000-8,000 total individuals it is below the population size threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion C (10,000 mature individuals). It does currently not meet the subcriteria, though. However, some of the larger subpopulations (Scandinavian and Baltic) have shown declining trends in the past decade and if this trend persists, the lynx population within the EU could meet Criterion C1 in the near future. Consequently, it is assessed as Near Threatened at the EU level.</p>  <p>Continued conservation measures are required to ensure the recovery of the species. This is particularly true for the Critically Endangered Balkan lynx subspecies, but also for the reintroduced populations in Western and Central Europe (Alpine, Vosges-Palatinian, Jura, Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian, Dinaric) which are still small and are classified as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Additionally, the recent negative trends in some of the larger autochthonous subpopulations (Scandinavian and Baltic) have to be reversed.</p>  <p>Note: The assessment of the subpopulations is mainly based on total population size (number of lynx individuals) or number of independent individuals (adults and subadults, based on capture-recapture estimates by means of camera trap surveys extrapolated to the distribution area of the subpopulation) as these are the estimates usually available from the range countries. The number of mature individuals is, however, lower than these numbers, which was taken into account when assessing the Category.</p>  <p><strong>1. Jura</strong><br/>Endangered (D). Lynx numbers in the Jura Mts. have increased to c.140 independent individuals and the range has expanded. It however still qualifies as Endangered under Criterion D because the subpopulation size is below 250 mature individuals. In recent years, a few male lynx from the Jura Mts. have dispersed to neighbouring regions (e.g. the Black Forest in Germany). However, there is too limited immigration of lynx from neighbouring subpopulations, e.g. the Alps, into the Jura subpopulation to provide a sufficient demographic rescue effect. Therefore, the Red List Category is not adjusted for connectivity.</p>  <p><strong>2. Vosges-Palatinian</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (C1, D). The Vosges-Palatinian subpopulation is on the verge of extinction. Numbers had dropped from 30-40 lynx in 2005 to 1-3 ten years later which is a reduction of 91% (CR Criterion C1 (25% reduction in 4 years) in addition to Criterion D for the very small population size). Since 2011, two individuals have been detected in camera-trap surveys and one collared individual from the EU LIFE project ""Reintroduction of lynx in the biosphere reserve Palatinian Forest"" has been observed in France. In the frame of this EU LIFE project, a few individuals are being released into the Palatinian Forest in Germany. Nine individuals were released in 2016-2017, with a total of 20 lynx&#160;planned to be released. However, as the reintroduction only started in 2016 and there was a continuing decline throughout the years before, Critically Endangered under Criteria C and D is still considered valid. There is so far too limited immigration from the Jura Mts. to provide a demographic rescue effect.</p>  <p><strong>3. Alpine</strong><br/>Endangered (D). The subpopulation has slightly increased to c. 163 individuals, which is however still small and the subpopulation&#160;remains Endangered. In addition, the increase was partly due to the foundation of stepping stone subpopulations through translocations of lynx. So far the subpopulation is not receiving any relevant immigration from neighbouring subpopulations&#160;which are all also small and having conservation problems themselves (e.g. Dinaric subpopulation). The Alpine subpopulation&#160;itself is fragmented into four smaller subpopulations in the Western and Eastern Alps. Consequently, the Red List Category is not adjusted.</p>  <p><strong>4. Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (D). The distribution of the Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian subpopulation&#160;has stagnated since the late 1990s (Magg <em>et al. </em>2016). The subpopulation has decreased from an estimated 75 individuals in 2005 to c.50 individuals in 2006-2011. In the past few years, it has slightly recovered to 60-80 independent individuals in 2015 and numbers seem to stabilize. 60-80 independent individuals correspond to about 45-60 mature individuals, which is just around the threshold (50 mature individuals) for Endangered under Criterion D. Considering the previous long-term negative trend and that limiting factors have not yet been reversed (Magg <em>et al.</em> 2016) suggests however a precautionary approach (thus taking into account the lower population estimate of less than 50 mature individuals) and classification as Critically Endangered. Neighbouring lynx subpopulations are small and threatened, and there are barriers to dispersal, consequently, no rescue effect from them can be expected and the Red List Category is not adjusted.<br/> <br/><strong>5. Dinaric</strong><br/>Endangered (D). The subpopulation&#160;size in total has been rather stable in the past decade at around 130 individuals, however, it has decreased in the northern part of its range. Besides a high level of human-caused mortality (Sindicic <em>et al</em>. 2016), problems of inbreeding have been noticed due to the very few founder individuals released in 1973 (Sindicic <em>et al.</em> 2013). The subpopulation is isolated and no rescue effect can be expected. It is assessed as Endangered under Criterion D. Efforts are on the way to reinforce the subpopulation with lynx from the Carpathians in the frame of the EU LIFE project “<a href=""https://www.lifelynx.eu/"">Preventing the Extinction of the Dinaric-SE Alpine Lynx Population Through Reinforcement and Long-term Conservation</a>“).</p>  <p><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>Least Concern. The Carpathians host one of the largest continuous lynx subpopulations&#160;in Europe. The overall number is about 2,100-2,400. Overall it appears to be rather stable, although in certain regions numbers have decreased, either reflecting a real trend (e.g. Ukraine and Bulgaria) or due to better monitoring systems in place which proved that previous numbers were overestimated (e.g. Slovakia, Kubala <em>et al. </em>2017). When considering the number of mature individuals, the threshold for Near Threatened under Criterion D is almost met. A careful monitoring of the situation (which requires the implementation of better monitoring systems in many of the range countries) and a re-assessment within a few years are recommended.</p>  <p><strong>7. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Vulnerable (C1). The Scandinavian subpopulation&#160;has a large range (AOO over 450,000 km²) but has further declined in numbers in the past decade. It is now estimated at c.1,300-1,800 individuals compared to c.1,800-2,300 in 2011 and c.2,000 in 2001. The drastic decline, which is at least in part due to a management goal designed to reduce conflicts related to sheep and semi-domestic reindeer depredation, would qualify for classifying the subpopulation as Endangered under Criterion C1 (less than 2,500 mature individuals and a 20% decline over two generations). However, in 2015 and 2016, the decline was halted. There is some connectivity with the Karelian subpopulation and single individuals are likely to disperse. The Category is therefore altered to Vulnerable. The extent of this connectivity and the phylogeny of these two subpopulations, however, need some further investigation. A careful monitoring of the situation, an adaptive adjustment of hunting quotas and derogations, and a re-assessment within a few years are highly recommended.</p>  <p><strong>8. Karelian</strong><br/>Least Concern. The subpopulation in Finland has further increased and is now estimated c.2,500 individuals (compared to 1,100 animals in 2004). Although there is no up-to-date information from Russian Karelia, the overall subpopulation is also thought to be stable there. It is furthermore connected with the large neighbouring subpopulation&#160;in Russia from which a potential rescue effect is to be expected. Therefore, the Karelian subpopulation&#160;is assessed as Least Concern.</p>  <p><strong>9. Baltic</strong><br/>Least Concern. The subpopulation consists of around 1,200-1,500 individuals, without considering Russia and Belarus for which no current information is available. Although there was a slight decrease – particularly in Estonia (probably due to the effect of prey declines following snow-rich winters) – this subpopulation&#160;is connected both to the Karelian and the larger Asian Russian subpopulation from which a potential rescue effect can be expected. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern. Developments in the Baltic States and Poland, however, need to be carefully surveyed as the distribution area in this part of the range is still fragmented. A further reduction in Estonia has to be prevented.</p>  <p><strong>10. Balkan</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (D). This subpopulation consists of&#160;only&#160;20-39 mature individuals and has been assessed as Critically Endangered in 2015 (Melovski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Number and distribution have not changed since, and the population is isolated. Therefore, Critically Endangered under Criterion D is still valid.</p>  <p><strong>11. Harz</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (D). This population has been newly founded through re-introduction of lynx into the Harz Mountains in Germany. Formerly treated as an “occurrence”, it is now considered a subpopulation. Between 2000 and 2006, 24 lynx were reintroduced into the Harz National Park in Lower Saxony. Since 2002, reproduction is regularly recorded (<a href=""https://www.luchsprojekt-harz.de/luchsprojekt/de/start/"">https://www.luchsprojekt-harz.de/luchsprojekt/de/start/</a>). It is currently estimated at 46 independent individuals, is isolated, and qualifies for Critically Endangered under Criterion D (below 50 mature individuals).</p>","<p>Throughout Europe and Siberia, the Eurasian Lynx is primarily associated with forested areas which have good ungulate populations and which provide enough cover for hunting. It inhabits extended, temperate and boreal forests from the Atlantic in Western Europe to the Pacific coast in the Russian Far East (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). In Europe, it can be found in Mediterranean forests up to the transition zone of taiga to tundra and lives from sea level up to the tree line (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). In the far north of Scandinavia lynx can also make extensive use of open alpine tundra habitats.</p>  <p>The Eurasian lynx is the largest species in the <em>Lynx </em>genus, and the only one to primarily depend on ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller species where ungulates are less abundant. Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smaller ungulate species, such as roe deer and chamois. Occasionally, lynx also hunt foxes, hares, marmots, wild pigs, beavers, birds or domestic animals such as sheep and goats, or, in Scandinavia, semi-domestic reindeer (Odden&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Mattisson <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the northern parts of European Russia and western Siberia, where roe deer are absent, mountain hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).</p>  <p>Home range size varies widely from 100 to over 1,000 km² (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008) depending on both prey density and social pressure (Herfindal <em>et al.</em> 2005, Aronsson <em>et al</em>. 2016). Home ranges averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland’s Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 1997). Average home range sizes in Switzerland were 90 km² for females and 150 km² for male lynx (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). In contrast, home range sizes are almost an order of magnitude larger in northern Scandinavia. Male home ranges generally enclose 1-2 female territories. Densities are typically 1-3 adults per 100 km², although higher densities of up to 5/100 km² have been reported from Eastern Europe and parts of Russia and lower densities of 0.3/100 km² from Scandinavia (Jedrzejewski <em>et al.</em> 1996, Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sunde <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>","<p>The major threats to lynx in Europe are low acceptance due to conflict with hunters (and in northern Europe also with livestock farmers and semi-domestic reindeer herders), illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation mainly due to infrastructure development, poor wildlife management structures and poor law enforcement, and accidental mortality.</p>  <p>There are also concerns in regard to the low genetic diversity and small population sizes shown in some of the populations. Besides the authochthonous Balkan lynx population this particularly concerns all the reintroduced populations which have – compared to the Carpathian source population – a considerably reduced heterozygosity and the high number of lost alleles as a consequence of genetic drift (Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2011, Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff unpubl.). This phenomenon is more pronounced in the Alpine (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff unpubl., Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff 2003), Dinaric (Sindicic <em>et al</em>. 2013), Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian and Vosges-Palatinian populations (Bull <em>et a</em><em>l.</em> 2016) while the Jura subpopulation is doing better. Inbreeding and inbreeding depression is, therefore, a potential threat to all the reintroduced, small subpopulations.</p>  <p>Additional threats to the European populations are detailed below:<br/> <br/><strong>1. Jura</strong><br/>Traffic accidents, illegal killing, conflicts with hunters and lack of knowledge about conflict mitigation.</p>  <p><strong>2. Vosges-Palatinian</strong><br/>Illegal killing due to conflicts with hunters and fragmentation used to be the major threats. Currently, the small population size is of big concern.</p>  <p><strong>3. Alpine</strong><br/>Threats include illegal killing, infrastructure development (especially road constructions), vehicle and train collisions, and limited dispersal. An emerging threat for the Alpine population is the narrow genetic base: all of the relatively few founder animals came from the same region and some of them were probably closely related. Genetic analysis indicates that the Alpine population has today the smallest level of heterozygosity of all European lynx populations.</p>  <p><strong>4. Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian</strong><br/>Intentional illegal killing, conflicts with hunters, and poor enforcement of legislation are the most relevant threats. Illegal killing is considered the most likely cause for the limited distribution (Magg <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  <p><strong>5. Dinaric</strong><br/>Poor enforcement of legislation (illegal killing), traffic mortalities and prey/food base depletion are major threats to the Dinaric population. An emerging additional threat is inbreeding depression as the population displays a considerable level of inbreeding (Sindicic <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>  <p><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>Poor integration of science into decision-making, traffic mortalities, conflicts with hunters, and lack of knowledge about species numbers and trends (lack of robust monitoring systems) are considered the most prominent threats.</p>  <p><strong>7. Scandinavian</strong><br/>The main threats are legal hunting (i.e. quotas are set too high) and illegal killing, both due to conflicts with livestock (nomadic grazing of reindeer, free-ranging sheep, Mattisson <em>et al.</em> 2014) and conflicts with hunters. Data indicate that illegal killing is an important mortality cause in some areas (Andrén <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>8. Karelian</strong><br/>Potential threats are intentional legal hunting/calling, conflicts with hunters, and lack of capacity and funding in management authorities.</p>  <p><strong>9. Baltic</strong><br/>Roads and railroads, poor dialogue with stakeholders, prey/food base, lack of knowledge about species numbers and trends, and lack of capacity and funding in management structures were considered the most important threats.</p>  <p><strong>10. Balkan</strong><br/>Poor enforcement of legislation, lack of capacity and funding in management structures, poor integration of science into decision making, corruption, accidental illegal killing and poorly regulated large-scale forestry all pose a major threat to the Balkan lynx.</p>  <p><strong>11. Harz</strong><br/>Road fatalities and diseases are the most relevant mortality factors of the released lynx so far (Anders 2016).</p>","<p>The total number of lynx in Europe is estimated at 8,000-9,000 individuals (excluding Russia and Belarus) and 17,000-18,000 individuals including European Russia, respectively. The largest subpopulations are the autochthonous ones in the north and east which have around 1,500-2,500 individuals each: Scandinavian (~1,300‐1,800), Karelian (Finish part ~2,500), Baltic (~1,200-1,500), Carpathian (~2,100-2,400). All the re‐introduced populations are still of small size. The current subpopulation sizes are as follows: Alpine 140‐170, Bohemian‐Bavarian-Austrian 60-80, Dinaric ~140, Jura ~140, Vosges‐Palatinian a few individuals, Harz 46 individuals. The subpopulation of greatest conservation concern is the fifth autochthonous one, the Balkan lynx subpopulation, which numbers only 20-39 mature individuals.</p>  <p>Most subpopulations have generally been stable in the past few years. Exceptions are the Scandinavian and Baltic subpopulations which have decreased and the Vosges-Palatinian population which has almost vanished.</p>  <p>Information on the status, distribution and developments of the European subpopulations over time are compiled in Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten (1990), Breitenmoser <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2000), von Arx <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2004), Linnell <em>et al. </em>(2008), Kasczensky <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2013), Chapron <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) and LCIE (in prep.).</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Eurasian Lynx has a very broad distribution. It occurs along forested mountain ranges in southeastern and Central Europe and from northern and eastern Europe through the boreal forests of Russia, down into Central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Europe, it was probably absent from some of the larger islands such as Ireland and Sicily and from countries with few forests. It was also absent from the Iberian Peninsula, where the smaller Iberian Lynx (<em>Lynx pardinus</em>) occurs. From this extensive distribution, lynx were exterminated from most of western and Central Europe with the exception of the Carpathian Mountains. It also survived in a small area in the southeastern Balkan (FYR Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro). Larger populations persisted in Fennoscandia and the Baltic States (but populations were heavily reduced), and in European Russia. Human activities reduced the lynx to its minimum numbers in the 1950s. In recent decades, many populations have recovered (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014). Lynx have been released in several areas of Europe in an effort to reintroduce this elusive predator, including in Switzerland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and France. There are some local but insufficiently documented releases known to support lynx populations in Poland and Lithuania.</p>  <p>Lynx occurring in Europe are viewed as belonging to eleven distinct populations (von Arx <em>et al.</em> 2004, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 2008, LCIE in prep.):<br/> <br/><strong>1. Jura</strong><br/>This population stretches across the Jura Mountains from central-eastern France north of the Rhone to western Switzerland between Geneva and Basel. Based on reintroduction in Switzerland in 1974/75, lynx have now colonised almost the entire mountain range. <br/> <br/><strong>2. Vosges-Palatinian</strong><br/>Founded through re-introductions in the French Vosges Mountains in the 1980s, the established population expanded to the German Palatinian Forest. The population started declining in the 1990s and is currently at the verge of extinction. A current <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&amp;n_proj_id=5104"">EU LIFE project</a> (Reintroduction of lynx in the biosphere reserve Palatinian Forest”) aims at releasing 20 lynx from the Carpathian and Jura populations into the Palatinian Forest in Germany (<a href=""https://snu.rlp.de/de/projekte/luchs/"">https://snu.rlp.de/de/projekte/luchs/</a>). <br/> <br/><strong>3. Alpine</strong><br/>Originates from re-introduction projects in the 1970s in Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. In the 1990s the population was fragmented into two sub-populations, nowadays, four subpopulations are identified (Molinari <em>et al.</em> 2018): (1) The area occupied by lynx in the north-western Alps (CH, FR) which has increased, (2) a new subpopulation founded in north-eastern Switzerland with the translocation of 12 lynx between 2001 and 2008, (3) a new occurrence established through the release of five lynx from 2011–2017 in the north-eastern Alps (Kalkalpen AT) and (4) the south-eastern Alpine subpopulation (IT, SI) which has however decreased continuously since 2000.<br/> <br/><strong>4. Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian</strong><br/>The population stretches in the triangle of the three range countries: in the south-western Czech Republic (Šumava Mts., SE-part of the Český les Mts. = Oberpfälzerwald, the Šumava foothills, Blanský les, Novohradské Mts.; Kutal <em>et al. </em>2017), eastern Germany (Bayerischer and Oberpfälzer Forest, Fichtelgebirge, Frankenwald), and northern Austria (Böhmerwald, Mühlviertel, Waldviertel).<br/> <br/><strong>5. Dinaric</strong><br/>The Dinaric population is distributed from central-southern Slovenia through central Croatia (Gorski Kotar and Lika) up to western Bosnia.<br/> <br/><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>The distribution area covers at present almost the entire mountain chain of the Carpathians. The stronghold of the population is in Romania. Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine also hold relevant population segments. The distribution in Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria is scattered. Distribution and numbers may be overestimated as in many of the range countries no robust monitoring system exists. <br/> <br/><strong>7. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Lynx occur from southeastern to northern Norway and almost all over Sweden. <br/> <br/><strong>8. Karelian</strong><br/>The population stretches from the Republic of Karelia across to Finland where it is however only permanently present in the south to the centre of the country. The occasional presence in northern Finland is consistent with the situation in Murmanskaya Oblast, where indications are also much more scarcely compared to Karelia (Bragina <em>et al.</em> 2015) and with animals shared with the Scandinavian population.<br/> <br/><strong>9. Baltic</strong><br/>In the north (Estonia, eastern Latvia and northern Belarus) the distribution is continuous with Russia. In the rest of the range (Lithuania, main parts of Belarus, Poland, the Ukraine, and Kaliningrad) the distribution is highly fragmented.<br/> <br/><strong>10. Balkan</strong><br/>The Balkan Lynx is distributed in the south-west Balkans, mainly in the border area between Albania and Macedonia. Mavrovo National Park in Macedonia is the stronghold of the population. The Munella Mts. in Albania host the second but smaller subpopulation. Two different individuals were pictured in Bjeshkët e Nemuna, western Kosovo, not far from the border with Montenegro. From time to time there are single, unconfirmed observations in northern Greece.</p>  <p><strong>11. Harz</strong><br/>Lynx were reintroduced into the Harz National Park in Lower Saxony from 2000–2006. They have settled the entire Harz Mountains and surrounding areas.</p>",The species is sometimes hunted for sport. In some&#160;countries the species is also important for the skin market and the pelt&#160;industry.,Terrestrial,"<p>Included on CITES Appendix II and protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix III with the exception of the Balkan lynx <em>Lynx lynx balcanicus </em>which is listed in Appendix II) and the EU Habitats Directive (Annexes II and IV, except for Estonia where it is Annex V and with an exception from Annex II, and Finland and Latvia where it also has an exception from Annex II). The Lynx is protected and hunting prohibited in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine. In Sweden, Finland and Romania the lynx is protected but a limited number of lynx can be killed under Derogation. In Estonia and Norway the lynx is listed as a game species with an open hunting season and in Latvia lynx are exploited to a limited extent under derogation (Kaczensky <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the European part of Russia, the lynx is hunted/trapped in places where it is abundant as in some areas of the Central region and the Volga region, and in most areas of the North-Western region. Hunting is not allowed in the Northern Caucasus and in the Southern region (Bersenev <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>Since 2006, a programme for the recovery of the Balkan Lynx is being implemented aiming to secure the survival and recovery of this Critically Endangered subspecies.</p>  <p>In several European range states, prevention measures to counteract livestock depredation are in place and awareness has increased but measures for managing conflicts with hunters are still missing (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>There is a need for improved monitoring activities in many parts of the Carpathian and Baltic populations.

147992107,41695,Civettictis civetta,Least Concern,,2019,2015-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"African Civet is listed as Least Concern because the species has a wide distribution range, is present in a variety of habitats, is relatively common across its range, is present in numerous protected areas,&#160;and has a total population believed to be relatively stable. It may, however, be undergoing some localised declines through hunting, including the off-take of wild animals (males) for the production of civetone, which is used as a fixing agent in the perfume industry.","African Civets occupy a wide variety of habitats including secondary forest, woodland, and bush habitats, as well as aquatic environments. They are generally absent from arid regions, with the exception of riverine systems therein. They are apparently uncommon in mature interior forest habitats, but will infiltrate deep forest via logging roads, and in the forests of West and Central Africa, they thrive in degraded and deforested areas, and are regularly encountered near villages (Ray 2013). They are also found on cultivated land, for instance in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Ethiopia (Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;African Civets are&#160;omnivorous and opportunistic foragers (Ray and Sunquist 2001,&#160;Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008b,&#160;Amiard 2014), and their diet may include cereals (maize, wheat, barley)&#160;and domestic fruits (e.g., bananas, figs, olives; Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008b). They are terrestrial, nocturnal and solitary, with exception of the breeding season when two or more individuals can be seen together. In Ethiopia, in the Bale Mountains National Park, one radio-tracked sub-adult male had a home range of 11.1 km²&#160;(Admasu <em>et al.</em> 2004), while in Wondo Genet, one adult male (0.74 km²) and one sub-adult female (0.82 km²) ranged over much smaller areas (Ayalew <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last two individuals moved at an average speed of 326 m/h and travelled between 1.33 and 4.24 km each night.","There are no major threats to the species. However, African Civets are commonly found for sale as bushmeat, for example in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al.</em> 2013) as well as in SE Nigeria, where they are used for both food and skin (Angelici <em>et al.</em> 1999). They are frequently found trapped for meat in other countries, including Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, DR Congo and Central African Republic (Ray 2013). The majority of animals (generally males, because of&#160;their higher civet musk production) kept for the trade of civetone are taken from the wild, and such off-takes are likely to have localised&#160;impacts&#160;on wild populations, as well as potentially to lead to a severely female-biased sex ratio. In addition, several African Civets have been reported to die within the first three weeks of capture&#160;because of&#160;severe stress and physical assault during capture and transportation (Pugh 1998). There are also some concerns about the welfare of these animals, which are typically maintained in very small cages in order to facilitate handling during musk extraction from the perineal glands.","This species is generally common. In South Africa, Amiard (2014) reported densities&#160;of 7.5–14.2 individuals/100 km²)&#160;in three game reserves located in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, respectively; these estimates were based on&#160;camera-trapping and individual identification (using natural markings on the flanks).&#160;Using the same methods,&#160;Isaacs <em>et al.</em> (in press) reported slightly lower densities (4.43–8.63 individuals/100 km²) in three study sites—two conservation areas and one mosaic area made of ecotourism, hunting and livestock farms—within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve (Limpopo). These authors hypothesised that differences in African Civet density might result from top-down regulation from large carnivores, recreational hunting, poisoning, resource provisioning or human activity.",Unknown,"African Civet is widely distributed in Africa from Senegal and Mauritania to southern Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and southern Somalia southwards in all countries to northeastern Namibia, north and east Botswana, and northeastern South Africa (Ray 2013). It is present on Zanzibar Island (Pakenham 1984, Stuart and Stuart 1988) and has been introduced to Sao Tome Island (Dutton 1994). The species is recorded from almost sea level to altitudes of 5,000 m a.s.l. on Mt Kilimanjaro (Moreau 1944).","Besides their prevalence in bushmeat markets in West and Central Africa, in particular,&#160;African Civets are economically important because of their perineal gland secretion (civet musk;&#160;Randall 1979, Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008a, Wondmagegne <em>et al.</em> 2011), which was exploited for many centuries as a fixing agent, called 'civetone', in the perfume industry (Anonis 1997). Even though synthetic alternatives have been available for nearly 70 years, civetone remains an important export commodity in several countries, such as Ethiopia, and to a lesser extent, Niger and Senegal (Ray 1995, 2013; Abebe 2003; Ray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>Between 1985 and 1997, civiculture (civet cat farming) generated a total revenue of between&#160;<em>ca</em>&#160;US$ 150,000–835,000 per year in Africa.&#160;According to Kumera (2005 <em>in</em>&#160;Bekele&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008b), there are over 200 registered and licensed African Civet farmers who capture African Civets in the wild and keep several thousand individuals in captivity for musk production in Ethiopia.&#160;In that country, only 2% of the civet musk produced is used nationally; the rest is exported, essentially to France (85%), for the perfume industry (Girma 1995). Small quantities of civet musk are also exported&#160;to Arabian&#160;countries for medicinal purposes and to India for use in the tobacco industry (Tamiru 1995).",Terrestrial,They are present in numerous protected areas across their range.

156536762,11638,Leptailurus serval,Least Concern,,2019,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern the Serval is relatively abundant and widespread.Within the last few years there are many new records of Servals implying an expanding and recolonizing of some areas (Herman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bout 2010, Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hickisch and Aebischer 2013, Mugerwa 2013). There is no data confirming the new findings to be an enlargement of the Serval's distribution range or to be a shift of the range due to habitat loss and/or degradation, climate change or human impact, etc. However, habitat loss and degradation of wetlands is of concern, as is the level of skin trade in west Africa (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Servals are rare south of the Sahara in the Sahel region such as Senegal (Clement <em>et al</em>. 2007). A 2007 Mediterranean Mammal Assessment workshop classified Servals north of the Sahara as regionally Critically Endangered. The isolated population along the Mediterranean coast, where it is known to occur only in Morocco (Cuzin 2003), possibly in Algeria (K. de Smet pers. comm.), and has been reintroduced (from East African stock) in Tunisia (Hunter and Bowland 2013), is classified regionally as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(i). There are fewer than 250 mature individuals; each subpopulation is smaller than 50 and completely isolated (from each other and from sub-Saharan African populations). The status of these populations has not been reassessed and since 2003 there are have been no new confirmed records.<br/><p><br/></p><p>  </p>","Sunquist and Sunquist (2002) stated, that the Serval has quite specific habitat requirements, so it may be locally restricted to smaller areas within its broad distribution range; it is not found in areas of rainforest or desert like habitats.<br/><br/>In sub-Saharan Africa, Servals are found in well-watered savanna long-grass environments and are particularly associated with reedbeds and other riparian vegetation types (Thiel 2011). Geertsema (1981) associated Servals with well-watered habitats like grass savannas along river reed beds and swamps, in brush and open woodlands and along the edge of forests. Van Aarde and Skinner (1986) showed significantly higher usage of riverine habitats than expected. Grimshaw <em>et al.</em> (1995) and Andama (2000) even reported Servals on high altitude moorlands and bamboo thickets. They also range up into alpine grasslands, up to 3,800 m on Mount Kilimanjaro (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Servals can penetrate dense forest along waterways and through grassy patches, but are absent from the rainforests of Central Africa, and from desert environments. In North Africa, they are found from semi-desert to cork oak forest on the Mediterranean coast (De Smet 1989, Cuzin 2003). Servals are able to tolerate agricultural areas provided cover is available (Geertsema 1985, Thiel 2011), and may also benefit from forest clearance and the resulting encroachment of savanna at the edges of the equatorial forest belt (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Serval specialize in preying on small mammals, in particular rodents, with birds of secondary importance, followed by reptiles and arthropods (Geertsema 1985, Bowland 1990, Thiel 2011). In Zambia Servals feed mainly on small mammals weighing in average <em>ca</em>&#160;70 g and up to 1.5 kg, which mostly are nocturnal and have a preference for grassland, wetland or habitats associated with water; birds have an average weight of <em>ca</em> 250 g, in form of smaller birds (up to 200 g) or larger Galliformes (ground dwellers up to 4 kg) (Thiel 2011).","The major threat to Serval is wetland habitat loss and degradation (Thiel 2011). Wetlands harbour comparatively high rodent densities compared with other habitat types, and form the core areas of Serval home ranges. Of secondary importance is degradation of grasslands through annual burning followed by over-grazing by domestic livestock, leading to reduced abundance of small mammals (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>International legal commercial trade is generally declining (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although skins are still traded in large quantities in some countries, such as Senegal, Gambia and Benin (Burnham and Di Silvestre in Hunter and Bowland 2013), and exported to North Africa (K. de Smet and F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007). Serval pelts seen in trade in Morocco could come from elsewhere, or could indicate the species continued existence in that country (Arce and Prunier 2006). In Zambia pelts are rarely used for traditional clothing, often it is used as substitute for Leopard skins (C. Thiel pers. comm.) Trade in West Africa appears to be primarily for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. For example, they are highly valued for traditional medicine in Nigeria, where, among markets surveyed in five south-west Nigerian towns in 1994, Servals were the second most commonly offered mammalian species (Sodeinde and Soewu 1999 in Hunter and Bowland 2013).&#160;Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local&#160;markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2001) for occurrence in Cameroon and by Sayer and Green (1984) for occurrence in Benin.<br/><br/>Although Serval very rarely prey upon livestock (and indeed may even be beneficial to crop farmers due to their predilection for rodents), in rural areas throughout Africa, they are sometimes persecuted for taking poultry and indiscriminate predator control methods practised by pastoralists frequently kill them (L. Hunter and J. Bowland pers. comms.).<br/><br/>Sometimes other predators, such as leopards, hyaenas or lions, kill young and even adult Serval (Thiel 2011).","Outside northern Africa, where it is considered to meet the Red List Criteria for Endangered (Cuzin 2003) and the Sahel, where it is rare (Clement <em>et al.</em> 2007), the Serval is commonly recorded from most major national parks and reserves. Their status outside reserves is uncertain, but they are inconspicuous and may be common in suitable habitat as they are tolerant of farming practices provided there is cover and food available (Bowland 1990, Thiel 2011). The minimum density of Servals in optimal habitat in Ngorongoro Crater was 0.42 animals/km² (Geertsema 1985) and 0.1 animals/km² in Luambe National Park in Zambia (Thiel 2011).",Stable,"The Serval occurs widely through sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of tropical rainforest and the Saharan desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). North of the Sahara, there are few records from Morocco (Cuzin 2003), possible records in Algeria (K. de Smet pers. comm.), and after they went extinct in Tunisia, Servals have been reintroduced using animals of East African stock into Feijda National Park (Hunter and Bowland 2013). Servals are rare south of the Sahara in the Sahel region such as Senegal (Clement <em>et al</em>.  2007). Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local&#160;markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels <em>et al</em>.

The Serval is locally extinct in the South of South Africa.<br/><br/>Within the last years there are new records of Servals implying an expanding and recolonizing of some areas, such as central South Africa, Gabon, North West province of South Africa, eastern Central African Republic, south western Uganda and central Namibia (Herrmann <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bout 2010, Thorn <em>et al.</em>  2011, Hickisch and Aebischer 2013, Mugerwa 2013, C. Thiel pers. comm).","For uses, see under Threats.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The Serval is listed on CITES Appendix II.

Odzala N.P. in Congo Republic could be a key site for protecting serval as it is the only currently known protected population in the Gabon-Congolian savanna region, which are isolated from the Miombo woodlands south of the Congo River (P. Henschel pers. comm.).<br/><br/>As Geertsema (1985) and Bowland (1990) mentioned the key to Serval conservation is Wetland conservation. For these reasons it is crucial to investigate the Serval’s habitat requirements and to create an updated action plan for this species (Thiel 2011).

160755590,7960,Equus zebra,Vulnerable,A3bcd,2019,2018-04-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The global population of Mountain Zebra (<em>Equus zebra</em>) is estimated at 34,979 mature individuals (based on 55% to 75% mature). The majority of these are the subspecies Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra (<em>E. z. hartmannae</em>; about 33,265 mature individuals), with much fewer of the Cape Mountain Zebra subspecies (<em>E. z. zebra</em>; at least 1,714 mature individuals). The Cape Mountain Zebra has recovered from a nadir of 80 individuals in the 1950s with a steady population growth rate of 8-10% over the past three generations, leading to this subspecies recently being listed as Least Concern (Hrabar <em>et al.</em> 2015). While Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra is currently numerous, it has also recovered from a severe population reduction in the 1980s due to the effects of drought. The likelihood of increased drought frequency under climate projections, including the present four year drought, led to this subspecies recently being listed as VU A3bcd (Gosling <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>As about 95% of the global population of Mountain Zebra consists of the Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra subspecies, the listing of the species as a whole should follow the Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra listing: VU A3bcd, due to the probability of a future population reduction of at least 30% when further severe droughts occur.","Mountain Zebra inhabit rugged, broken mountainous and escarpment areas up to around 2,000 m with a rich diversity of grass species and perennial water sources. Mountain zebra are specialist grazers and browse only when forced to do so (Penzhorn 2013). Like most equids they are bulk, roughage feeders and so need to consume large daily quantities. They show seasonal movements with some individuals moving between summer and winter ranges and others staying in the same area. At the start of the annual summer rains, usually in November or December, mountain zebra sometimes move in large numbers to lower altitude green flushes (e.g., Joubert 1972). A physiological study suggest that their digestive efficiency and water requirements are similar to those of horses (Joubert and Louw 1976). Grobler (1983) showed that Cape Mountain Zebra are specialist grazers that select only a subset of the grass species available and that they prefer to feed at higher levels in the sward, sometimes selecting seed heads. Penzhorn (1982) reported that Cape Mountain Zebra make use of dwarf shrub foliage in the winter months but this was not seen by Grobler in the Mountain Zebra National Park. There are no studies of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra comparable to those on Cape Mountain Zebra. Gosling (pers ob) observed Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra browsing the leaves of <em>Catophractes alexandri </em>in Etosha NP even though grass was available nearby.<br/><br/>The typical social structure of Mountain Zebra is one of small harems comprising an adult stallion and one to three mares and their dependent foals and juvenile offspring; non-breeding groups consist primarily of bachelors, but sometimes include young fillies (Penzhorn 2013).<br/><br/>Movements between spatially separate ranges in different seasons have been recorded in some areas in Namibia, and in others seasonal movements without a clear separation of seasonal ranges have been seen. The fact that some animals move long distances to separate ranges under particular ecological circumstances means that Mountain Zebra should be regarded as a migratory species. Due to fences and other restrictions animals are not always free to migrate, however.<br/><br/>See the subspecies Red List assessments for more details on Habitats and Ecology.","Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra remains at risk of catastrophic decline under future droughts, as experienced in the early 1980s. The effects of drought and extreme weather on small populations has been documented for Przewalski's horses (<em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>) in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), and is currently affecting Grevy's Zebra (<em>E. grevyi</em>) in Kenya (B. Low-MacKaye, pers. comm. 2017). Increasingly sophisticated farming could further disrupt movements through fencing or by preventing access to surface water (Novellie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002).<br/><br/>The greatest current threat to Cape Mountain Zebra is further loss of genetic diversity through inbreeding, caused by small subpopulation sizes and/or small property sizes. New subpopulations have been created through translocation of animals, with all but one of these subpopulations originating from Mountain Zebra National Park (MZNP); the exception being De Hoop Nature Reserve, which consists of individuals from MZNP and Kammanassie Nature Reserve. Two thirds of the entire genotype is therefore located in just two populations (Kammanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserve (Moodley and Harley 2005)), while the remaining third comprises MZNP and reintroduced populations. Currently, the South African population of Cape Mountain Zebra is highly fragmented into a large number of small subpopulations yet little metapopulation management is practiced. Founder groups are often small (50% of subpopulations have had a founder population smaller than the recommended 14 animals, Hrabar and Kerley 2015), and genetic exchange between subpopulations is poor (73% of privately-owned subpopulations have only ever had a single introduction event, Hrabar and Kerley 2015), thereby increasing the risk of inbreeding and genetic drift. Vulnerability to disease also increases due to inbreeding. The subpopulations at both Bontebok National Park and Gariep Dam Nature Reserve, which have been shown to be inbred and lack genetic diversity, have both had an outbreak of sarcoid tumours (53% and 22% of the subpopulations, respectively), indicating a general immune system breakdown (Sasidharan 2006, Sasidharan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Development of a metapopulation management plan (and adoption of such plan into provincial and national conservation policy) which incorporates “resource mobilization strategies” (how human and financial resources will be utilized for successful implementation of the plan) is essential in ensuring the long-term survival of Cape Mountain Zebra.<br/><br/>Cape Mountain Zebra were once extensively hunted for their skins, because they competed with livestock for grazing, and allegedly because they broke fences (Penzhorn 1988). Today, however, the greatest threat to the Cape subspecies may stem from the risk of hybridization with Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra and Plains Zebra (Dalton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Hybridisation risk also exists for Hartmann’s Mountain zebra: possible hybridisation between mountain zebra and plains zebra (<em>E. quagga burchelli</em>) have been reported for some years in the Otjovasandu area of Etsoha NP where the two species overlap. Recent analysis of faecal DNA (Pauline Kamath pers. comm.) using microsatellite markers in samples of 21 of each species from Otjovasandu supports both hybridization and introgression. However, we do not know it this is part of a normal hybrid zone or if it is an artifact, perhaps caused by the boundary fence artificially keeping the two species in closer contact throughout the year than would be the case if mountain zebra were free to move westward. Hybridisation is also reported between the HMZ and donkeys in Angola (P. vaz Pinto unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In Namibia, there is commercial trade in Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra skins. Populations need to be carefully monitored so that harvesting does not adversely affect population viability. However, economical incentives provided through sustainable hunting also help improve prospects of coexistence with cattle farmers who occupy much of the range. Hartmann's Mountain Zebra are reportedly being harvested at a rate of about 2,000-3,000 per year, which may exceed their rate of population growth (e.g., Cape Mountain Zebra in Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve increase at about 5% per year; Watson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>A poorly understood, but emerging, threat is that of reintroduced large predators into areas containing subpopulations of Cape Mountain Zebra. This includes Lion (Addo Elephant, Mountain Zebra and Karoo national parks) and Cheetah (MZNP, some private reserves). Data indicate that Cape Mountain Zebra were preferred prey for Lion in Karoo National Park (C. Tambling unpubl. data), and anecdotal evidence suggests that cheetah suppressed population growth in at least one privately-owned population. Further research is needed to assess the extent and implications of this threat.","Mountain zebras were once widespread and numerous. In the 20<sup>th </sup>century both subspecies underwent dramatic declines, but subsequently populations have increased.

In 1998, the number of Cape Mountain Zebras had increased to about 1,200 individuals, with the largest population (reintroduced in the Karoo National Park), estimated to number 250 (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). From 1985 to 1995 the annual rate of increase was reported as 8.6 % (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996), 9.6 % between 1995 and 1998 (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002), 8.33 % between 2002 and 2009 (Hrabar and Kerley 2013) and 9.16% between 2009-2015 (Hrabar and Kerley 2015). However, estimating annual growth rate trends is challenging because most subpopulations are actively managed (maintained at sustainable stocking levels) and animals are often removed or augmented, which masks true growth rate.<br/><br/>Currently (2014/15), there are estimated to be between 1,714 and 3,247 mature individuals of Cape Mountain Zebra (using a 55% and 75% mature population structure respectively). In formally protected areas alone, there are an observed 1,714–2,338 mature individuals. A survey of animals on both formally protected and private properties found that the total population has grown to over 4,790 animals in 75 subpopulations (Hrabar and Kerley 2015). Fifty six populations (1,487 individuals) are on privately owned land and 19 are on formally protected areas (3,304 individuals). The majority of the population (69%) remains on formally protected land and the proportion on privately-owned land (31%) has not risen since 2009, despite the increase in subpopulation number. The MZNP and Karoo NP subpopulations continue to make up a significant proportion of the population, namely 25% and 18%, respectively.<br/><br/>The total formally protected population of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in 2004 was 80 individuals, increasing to 277 in Goegap Nature Reserve (M. Smit unpubl. data 2015) and Augrabies Falls National Park (Bissett <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>, 2016), plus an unknown number of animals in Richtersveld National Park. It is estimated that there are currently at least 570 Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra on private land in the Northern Cape (M. Smit, unpubl. Data, 2009-2013; A. Taylor, unpubl. data, 2014). A preliminary analysis to determine which private subpopulations can be considered wild, revealed that 64–95% of individuals on private land are eligible for inclusion in the assessment (N = 21 properties, A. Taylor, unpubl. data), which means 364-542 privately owned Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra are eligible for inclusion in this assessment. Private subpopulations are inferred to be increasing along with the expansion of the wildlife ranching industry. Overall the total mature and wild population size of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in South Africa, based on available data, is at least 592–724 (based on 75% mature). <br/><br/>There are therefore a total of 2,306-3,971 mature Mountain Zebra in South Africa, with an increasing population. However about 30% of Cape Mountain Zebra, and 25% of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra are located on private land, and the Mountain Zebras on protected areas are isolated.<br/><br/><strong>NAMIBIA</strong><br/>In 1998, the Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra population was estimated to number about 25,000, or approximately 8,300 mature individuals (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002) in Namibia. Limited data in 2008 indicated that populations were increasing on communal lands in the north-western part of the country (G. Stuart-Hill pers. comm. 2008): from 2000 to 2006 numbers increased from 6 to 27 individuals observed per 100 km of road surveyed. Nearly a decade of above-average rainfall was likely driving this increase. The national total of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in Namibia is currently estimated at 44,712 with an average density of 0.45 per km² (Gosling <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2018), although there has been a decline . This is certainly an underestimate because inadequate sampling precludes proper estimation of the numbers on private farms and freehold conservancies. Using the criterion of physiological maturity, rather than that of behavioral breeding status, the total number of mature individuals in Namibia is 32,416 mature individuals (72.5 % of 44,712). It should be noted that there has been a massive decline in zebras over the last 2-3 years due to the current drought (J. Muntifering Pers comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>ANGOLA</strong><br/>A recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Namibia in Iona National Park (Kolberg and Killian 2003) found an estimated subpopulation size of 263, or 191 mature Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra.<br/><br/><strong>GLOBAL POPULATION<br/></strong>Based on recent survey data, global population size of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra is about 33,265 (191 mature individuals in Angola, 592-724 in South Africa, and 32,416 in Namibia), with at least 1,714 Cape Mountain Zebra (in South Africa), resulting in a total global population of 34,979 mature Mountain Zebra.",Increasing,"The Mountain Zebra (<em>Equus zebra</em>) is currently found in South Africa, Namibia, and Angola. The Cape Mountain Zebra (<span><em>E. z. zebra</em>) is endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, while Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra (<span><span><em>Equus zebra hartmannae</em>)</span> is found mainly in Namibia, with small populations in Angola and South Africa. It is postulated that in historical times the two subspecies were separated by an area devoid of mountainous habitat, the Knersvlakte, which separates the Kamiesberg in the north from the Roggeveldberge in the south (Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). However there are no historical (pre-1920) records of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra south of the Orange River (Skead 2011).<br/><br/>Cape Mountain Zebra's historical distribution extended throughout the great escarpment range in the Cape, south of the Orange River, including the Cape Fold Belt Mountains (the southern parts of the current eastern Western Cape Province), and the southern extent of the Northern Cape province. Thus, although once widely distributed throughout the mountainous regions of the Cape, over-hunting and agricultural expansion reduced the population to fewer than 80 individuals located in just five areas of the former Cape province by the 1950s (Millar 1970). Only three remnant subpopulations from the former natural distribution survived: Mountain Zebra National Park, Kammanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserves (Smith <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>The current distribution of Cape Mountain Zebra is limited to (at least) 75 fenced and isolated subpopulations spread throughout the former range. Subpopulations have been reintroduced to, amongst others, Karoo, Addo Elephant, Bontebok, Tankwa Karoo and Camdeboo national parks, De Hoop Nature Reserve, Commando Drift Nature Reserve, Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area and Tsolwana Nature Reserve (Hrabar and Kerley 2015). Two of these reserve populations (Commando Drift and Tsolwana) are possibly extralimital, as there are no historical records of the species east of the Great Fish River (Skead 2007). The subpopulation at Gariep Dam Nature Reserve in the Free State Province is significantly extra-limital (Boshoff and Kerley 2013) and not included in this assessment. Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) regarded the West Coast National Park as being within the historical range but there is some doubt about this given that it is on the coast and 70 km from the closest historically-recorded subpopulation in Picketburg (Skead 2011). The issue of whether to include West Coast National Park to be within the subspecies’ range has not been resolved. The subpopulation at Oorlogskloof Nature Reserve in the Northern Cape lies in a historical range of Cape Mountain Zebra.<br/><br/>Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra primarily occupy the escarpment region of western Namibia that runs north-south along the entire length of the country and which form the boundary between an arid coastal plain (which includes the Namib Desert in the south and the Skeleton Coast in the north) and a wetter inland plateau. The current range of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra differs from the historical range in Namibia, partly because of the widespread establishment of artificial water sources which allow this water-dependent sub-species to occupy habitat that was previously unsuitable (Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/>Published accounts of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra distribution (Joubert 1973, Penzhorn 2013) refer to four subpopulations: (1) from Kunene Region southwards to the Ugab River and eastward to the Outjo District; (2) the Erongo Mountains; (3) the escarpment from the Swakop River southwards to the Naukluft Mountains and eastward along the Kuiseb and Gaub drainages into the Khomas Hochland; and (4) the Fish River canyon and Huns Mountains near the Orange River in the south.&#160; There is some evidence for these distinctions in the distribution map in Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002). However current information suggests that the three northern ‘subpopulations’ are essentially continuous. This may be due to significant population expansion or from under-sampling in some areas (especially where there are low levels of commercial farm questionnaire returns). The extent to which the Hunsberg/Fish River sub-population in the south is separated needs further investigation.<br/><br/>At the southern end of its distribution Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra extends into northern South Africa and are found in three conservation areas: Richtersveld and Augrabies National Parks and Goegap Provincial Nature Reserve (Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). They have also been introduced outside of their natural distribution range in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, North West and Free State provinces. At its northern end, the sub-species distribution extends into southern Angola and 263 were estimated in the Iona National Park in a 2003 survey (Kolberg and Kilian 2003).","Consumptive utilization of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in Namibia is allowed through appropriate regulations and a permit system. Permits issued by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism are required for any form of consumptive use in Namibia. The permit system aims to ensure that Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra utilization is sustainable and has no detrimental effect on the long-term survival of the species. ‘Shoot and sell’, trophy hunting and ‘keep and sell’ (live capture) are the different forms of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra utilization currently permitted in Namibia. The number of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra shot as trophies was 1,820 in 2008 and 1,064 in 2009 (van Schalkwyk <em>et al.</em> 2010). The mean number of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra harvested per annum in Namibia (2008–2012) was 3,538 (Shapi 2014), which is not predicted to impact population growth negatively. The number of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra killed illegally is not known however 6.2% of freehold farms reported losses over one recent year due to poaching (Lindsey 2011). No export of live animals from Namibia is allowed.<br/><br/>Cape Mountain Zebra are mostly traded as live animals on game auctions. The overall aim of harvesting on formally protected areas at present is population management but also to increase the national metapopulation. Overall, the offtake number is lower than the rate of population increase. No hunting takes place in any provincial or national parks where the species occurs, although translocations are used as a tool to manage subpopulation sizes. Illegal translocations and poaching occurs on a limited scale. Some poaching for bushmeat occurs in at least one subpopulation (Camdeboo National Park). Cases of Cape Mountain Zebra being hunted and sold or exported as Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra have also been reported. The CITES hunting quota is zero and thus there is no international trade.",Terrestrial,"Formally protected areas, and areas of good habitat (Lea <em><em>et al.</em></em> 206), are crucial for the conservation of Mountain Zebra, particularly in South Africa. Since Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra need to move flexibly over very large distances in response to spatial and temporal variation in rainfall and primary production, very large areas that are connected and support suitable habitat are needed if viable populations are to survive. <br/><br/>For details on specific conservation actions needed for the two subspecies see their Red List accounts. In summary, crucial actions needed for Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra include better surveys of population numbers, a regional perspective to land use planning, research on zebra ecology, hybridization and human-zebra relationships. For Cape Mountain Zebra key conservation actions are development and implementation of a metapopulation management strategy and a biodiversity management plan (also see Novellie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

They are abundant throughout their range and are increasing in distribution as humans continue to modify the landscape. The species is very versatile, especially in their ability to exploit human modified environments and there is no reason to expect that they are currently at risk of extinction.","Coyotes utilize almost all available habitats including prairie, forest, desert, mountain and tropical ecosystems. The ability of coyotes to exploit human resources allows them to occupy urban areas; their recent expansion in eastern Panama has been attributed to their using deforested areas and areas of cattle&#160;ranching (Méndez-Carvajal and Moreno 2014). Water availability may limit Coyote distribution in some desert environments.&#160;Coyotes are opportunistic, generalist predators that eat a variety of food items, typically consuming items in relation to changes in availability. Coyotes eat foods ranging from fruit and insects to large ungulates and livestock. Livestock and wild ungulates may often be represented in coyote stomachs and scats as carrion, but predation on large ungulates (native and domestic) does occur (Andelt 1987). Predation by Coyotes on neonates of native ungulates can be high during fawning (Andelt 1987). Coyotes in suburban areas are adept at exploiting human-made food resources and will readily consume dog food or other human-related items.","There are no current major threats to Coyote populations throughout their range. Local reductions are temporary and their range has been expanding. Conservation measures have not been needed to maintain viable populations. Coyotes adapt to human environs and occupy most habitats, including urban areas. Hybridization with wolves and dogs is documented, but likely occurs only at the leading edge of expanding populations, with back-crossing into the Coyote populations resulting in low levels of dog and wolf introgression spread throughout some new populations (VonHoldt <em>et al</em>. 2011; Mõnzon <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Coyotes are abundant throughout their range and are increasing in distribution as humans continue to modify the landscape. Elimination of larger predators (wolves, coyotes, jaguars) may also have assisted their expansion. Coyote density varies geographically with food and climate, and seasonally due to mortality and changes in pack structure and food abundance. Localized control efforts have sometimes temporarily reduced population size, but they quickly rebound through migration and breeding, and Coyote populations generally are stable or increasing in most areas.&#160;<br/><br/>Coyote densities in different geographic areas and seasons vary from 0.01–0.09 coyotes/km² in the winter in the Yukon (O'Donoghue <em>et al.</em> 1997) to 0.9/km² in the fall and 2.3/km² during the summer (post-whelping) in Texas (Knowlton 1972; Andelt 1985). Density in different geographic areas and seasons are listed in Gese and Bekoff (2004).",Increasing,"<p>Coyotes were originally native to the arid open country of U.S., Canada, and Mexico prior to European settlement (Hody and Kays 2018). During the 19th century, the Coyote expanded into forested biomes they previously hadn't used including eastern deciduous forests, taiga forests of the north, temperate rainforests in the north west, and tropical rainforests in the south. The fragmentation of forests with agriculture, and extinction of larger predators like the Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> and the Jaguar <em>Panthera onca</em>, are thought to have facilitated their expansion. Hybridization with dogs and wolves also played a role in their expansion eastward (Kays <em>et al</em>. 2010,; Von Holdt <em>et al</em>. 2011). Coyotes have now&#160;colonized all of North America except for polar areas, and are approaching the border between Central and South America in the Darien region of Panama.</p>","Coyote fur is still sought by trappers throughout its range, with harvest levels depending upon fur prices, local and state regulations, and traditional uses and practices.

It has become extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the USA, and their present distribution is more restricted; wolves occur primarily but not exclusively in wilderness and remote areas. Their original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third by deliberate persecution due to depredation on livestock and fear of attacks on humans. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes, rural human population shifts to cities and increasing prey populations have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonization in parts of its range and reintroduction in three areas of USA. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock and game species, exaggerated concern by the public regarding the threat and danger of wolves, and fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with long-term viability.<br/><br/>Although the Grey Wolf still faces some threats, its relatively widespread range and stable population trend mean that the species, at global level, does not meet, or nearly meet, any of the criteria for the threatened categories. The global population is estimated to be in the order of 200-250 thousands individuals.&#160;Therefore, it is assessed as Least Concern. However, at regional level, several wolf populations, such as those in Europe, are seriously threatened (<a href=""http://www.lcie.org/"">http://www.lcie.org</a>).</p>","Ranges in all northern habitats where there is suitable food (Mech 1970), densities being highest where prey biomass is highest (Fuller 1989).

Wolves will also eat smaller prey items, livestock, carrion, and garbage.","The historical range of the Grey Wolf has been reduced by about one-third, primarily in developed areas of Europe, Asia, Mexico, and the United States by poisoning and deliberate persecution due to depredation on livestock. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes, and rural human population shifts to cities have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonization in parts of Western Europe and the United States, and reintroduction in the western United States and Mexico. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock, especially in developing countries, exaggerated concern by the public concerning the threat and danger of wolves. Fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with long-term viability can be a threat in parts of the range with highest density of human activities.","Because of the diversity in climate, topography, vegetation, human settlement and development of wolf range, wolf populations in various parts of the original range vary from extinct to relatively pristine. Wolf densities vary from about one/12 km² to one/120 km².<br/><br/>Mech and Boitani (2004) provide details, for each range country, on subspecies present, population status, approximate numbers, the percentage of former range occupied at present, main prey (where known), legal status, and cause of decline. For Europe, the wolf population is essentially a large meta-population with several distinct subpopulations; the status and trends for each population is provided by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (<a href=""http://www.lcie.org/"">http://www.lcie.org/</a>) and in Chapron <em>et al</em>.

In general, population increases in North America and Europe are likely to be off-set by localized declines in other parts of the range.",Stable,"Originally, the Grey Wolf was the world's most widely distributed mammal, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15°N latitude in North America and 12°N in India. It became extinct in much of Western Europe (Boitani 1995), Mexico and much of the USA (Mech 1970) and Japan. Their present distribution is more restricted: wolves occur primarily in wilderness and remote areas, especially in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75°N to 12°N (Mech and Boitani 2004), but they are found also in human-dominated landscapes where there is sufficient prey base and human-caused mortality is low.

Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution with increased human populations (Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014), habitat fragmentation (UN 2014), increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008), excessive harvesting for ceremonial use of skins (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015), prey base declines (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East and West Africa, Middle East, East and South-east Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations have increased by 2.57 percent annually from 1994 to 2014 (UN 2014) driving a 57% increase in the conversion of potential Leopard habitat to agricultural areas from 1975 to 2000 (Brink and Eva 2009). Deforestation in South-east Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). These factors were not incorporated in the previous assessment and likely have a substantial impact on suitable Leopard range.<br/><br/>Comparison of the extent of extant range presented in this assessment (8,515,935 km², see map) with that produced by Red List Assessors in 2007 (21,953,435 km²: Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2008) yields a range reduction of 61%. However the severity of this reduction is inaccurate due to previous insufficient sampling (the 2016 map is much more detailed in resolution, see Methodology in the Supplementary Material), and the reduction has likely occurred over a longer time scale. Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2008, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect, however, that at least half of the reduction translates to real and relatively recent range loss. Also in southern Africa, the so called stronghold of the Leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that Leopard populations have remained stable (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015). In Zimbabwe, much Leopard range has disappeared due to the resettlement of private farmland and subsequent loss of prey populations (du Toit 2004). We estimate regional range loss of approximately 21% in southern Africa. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fusari <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2012) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Preliminary data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa. It is suggested that 4,500-7,000 Leopards area harvested annually to fuel the demand for Leopards skins by followers of the Nazareth Babtist (Shembe) Church only (Balme unpub. data).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme <em>et al.</em> (2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman <em>et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The concern about unsustainable trophy hunting has lately increased, e.g. South Africa has banned trophy hunting for 2016. This followed an alert by its CITES Scientific Authority that the number of Leopards in the country was unknown, and that trophy hunting posed a high risk to the survival of the species.<br/><br/>Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat and prey, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are not well understood, have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","<strong><em>Habitat Types and Range</em></strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the snowy regions of the Russian Far-East. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards do occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Occupancy survey found that Leopards occupied 174,066 km² of forest habitat in India (Jhalla <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Despite widespread occurrence they are killed in very large numbers in India (Raza <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong><em>Diet</em></strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10- 40 kgs) where available (Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitors density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the prey items in the diet (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Shehzad <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range.<br/><br/><strong><em>Home Range Size</em></strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 to 15 km² (Odden <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Hunter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Recent reports from northern Iraq suggest unsustainable levels of Leopard removal (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/>In the face of changing land-use, prey availability and direct mortality from humans, Leopards have persisted where other large predators have not. Their ability to live within human-dominated landscapes and feed on a variety of prey have given many people the impression that Leopards require little concern, however, recent trends have shown that current threats have substantially reduced Leopard populations throughout West and Central Africa, South-west and South-east Asia and China.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in review). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered and Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2008 and should retain these listings in 2016 based on the following population estimates and a declining trend:<br/><ul><li>Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(ii), D):&#160;&lt;60 (Jackson and Nowell 2008, Sugimoto <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Xiao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).</li><li>Arabian Leopard (<em>P. p. nimr</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 45-200 (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 350-525, with &lt;250 mature breeding adults (Ario <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 700-950 (Kittle and Watson 2015).</li><li>Persian Leopard (<em>P. p. saxicolor</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 800-1,000 (Khorozyan 2008).<br/></li></ul>[<strong>Note</strong> that although the Red List Categories and Criteria for the subspecies assessments published in 2008 have not changed, the assessments no longer appear on The IUCN Red List as the information they contain may be out-of-date or may contradictory to the information presented here.]<br/><br/>This current (2015) assessment looked at available information on Leopard status on a regional basis (as discussed below). Across the majority of range, leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) since the previous assessment as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards be listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. In India, the Caucasus and the Russian Far-East, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts.<br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> review). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were not undertaken for Leopards. Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and again, a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, from 1994 to 2014, the human population in Africa increased by 2.57 percent annually (from 0.699 billion to 1.139 billion) (UN 2014), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies <em>P. p. pardus</em> potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping, geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Since the previous assessment, remnant populations in Morocco and Algeria are likely extirpated as recent surveys have failed to confirm their presence (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). The Egyptian population is considered very small with only a few observed signs in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, whereas there has been no recorded sign in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, the North African subpopulation potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><u>Sub-Saharan Africa</u>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (Hatton <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UN 2013), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2013), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21 %, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa potentially qualifies as VU (criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for other areas of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g., Henschel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><u>Indian Leopard (<em>P. p. fusca</em>)</u>: The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Poaching for wildlife trade is an increasing threat to Indian Leopards (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). For example, Raza <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2012b) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Selvan <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Mondal <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000-14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). A full assessment is recommended for <em>P. p. fusca</em>, as it may potentially qualify as Vulnerable due to a suspected declining population containing fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/><u>North China Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. japonensis</em>)</u>: A recent review of Leopard distribution shows a &gt;80% reduction in range considered extant in 2008 (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). This subspecies, endemic to China, now occurs only in parts of seven provinces, and the total population is estimated at &lt;500 individuals (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), with the number of mature individuals likely less than that. Subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), and habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). These threats are expected to continue in the future, indicating that Leopard populations may continue to decline. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for <em>P. p. japonensis</em> or the subpopulation of North China, as it potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered or Endangered due to a small, steeply declining population.<br/><br/><u>Indochinese Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. delacouri</em>)</u>: A recent review showed a dramatic reduction of over 80% in range where Leopards are considered extant in South-east Asia compared to 2008 (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Singapore, and only small fragmented populations remain in Cambodia, southeastern China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a total estimated population of &lt;2,500 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade is probably the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (J. F. Kamler pers. obs.). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kawanishi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and thus likely to have negative impacts on the leopard populations. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for the Sout-heast Asian Leopard subpopulation (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>), as it potentially qualifies as Endangered due to a small declining population.<br/><br/><u>Other subspecies</u>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula (<em>P. p. nimr</em>), Java (<em>P. p. melas</em>), and Russian Far-East (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) continue to require listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. Although the population of <em>P. p. orientalis</em> may have increased recently, especially on the Chinese side of the border (Xiao <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the total population remains &lt;60 individuals. With no noted population or range increase, the Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) should retain its current status as Endangered. The Leopard of southwestern Asia (<em>P. p. saxicolor or ciscaucasica</em>) has been recorded in previously undocumented areas of the Caucasus, such as Georgia and Azerbajian (Sarukhanova 2014, Voskyanyan 2014), however, due to overall low numbers and restricted range, this subspecies should remain listed as Endangered (Khorozyan 2008). See the individual Red List accounts for more details regarding these subspecies.<br/><br/><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected.",Decreasing,"Our assessment of Leopard distribution has been divided into two geographic regions: Africa and Asia. In order to describe these regions, we have further divided Leopard distribution into sub-regions to address local population trends. A detailed discussion of the methodology used to produce the 2015 range map can be found in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Africa</em></strong><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in North Africa has been restricted by 97% of their former range with only remnant, isolated populations remaining (Durant <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). An adult male Leopard was killed in the Elba region of southeastern Egypt in retaliation for livestock depredation, though evidence of a breeding population is still uncertain (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2014). Continued camera-trapping efforts have failed to capture the presence of Leopard in the Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). The presence of Leopards was confirmed in the Ahaggar Mountains of Algeria from the genetic testing of one scat sample in 2005 but no presence has been confirmed since (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). Leopards are thought to be extirpated from Morocco (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u>West Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in West Africa has been dramatically reduced. This reduction is likely due to habitat fragmentation, but also more rigorous survey efforts that have confirmed presence and likely absence across the region (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014). Leopards have been confirmed in Niger along the southwestern border with Benin and Burkina Faso (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014) but previous reports in Air and Tenere National Reserves are unconfirmed. Leopards are generally restricted to a few protected areas from Senegal in the west to Nigeria in the east. Leopards have been reported in the south of Senegal including Parc National de Niokolo-Koba. In Sierra Leone, there are small remnant populations near Outamba Kilimi National Park and Gola National Forest as well as the eastern boundary with Guinea/ Liberia. Leopard populations in Liberia have been recorded in Lofa-Mano National Park in the west and Sapo National Park in the east. In Ghana, Leopards are found along the boundary with Côte d’Ivoire and Mole National Park in the north and west (<em>c.</em> Burton pers. comm. 2014). In Benin, Leopard are found along the northern boundary. Leopards are nearly absent from Nigeria.<br/><br/><u>Central Africa</u>: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Leopard range was largely reduced in areas of increased human influence and areas relatively easy to access and therefore open to illegal hunting and bushmeat trade. In Cameroon, Leopards are found in the northern and southern portions of the country. In Gabon, Leopards are found throughout the country with small absent pockets in the southeast and southwest. In the Central African Republic (CAR) Leopards are found in the southwest, central and eastern portions of the country. Leopards are found throughout South Sudan with the exception of the Sudd wetland.<br/><br/><u>East Africa</u>: The distribution of Leopards in East Africa has been reduced, in particular in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and central Tanzania. There are possible remnant populations in Djibouti, Eritrea, and North Sudan. They are nearly absent from Somalia. Leopards are found throughout southern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda and the west, central and southern portions of Kenya (Z. Davidson pers. comm. 2014, I. Seme pers. comm.2014, G. Yirga pers. comm. 2014). In Tanzania, Leopards are found throughout the Serengeti-Ngorogoro Crater system and to the south and west. It is thought that Leopards are absent from the southeastern boundary of Lake Victoria to Central Tanzania.<br/><br/><u>Southern Africa</u>: Southern Africa likely has the healthiest Leopard populations of their entire range. It is generally thought that Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have declining but healthy Leopard populations outside of human dominated areas (C.<em>&#160;</em>Begg pers. comm. 2014, A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2014, P. Schuette pers. comm. 2014). In Namibia, Leopards inhabit most of the country with the exception of the highly populated northern region, the arid southeast farmlands and the desert coast (Stein 2011). Botswana has a continuous Leopard population in the North and West. In South Africa, Leopards are found along the boundaries with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique with dense populations located in the Limpopo region. Leopards are also located in the Cape provinces of South Africa.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Asia</em></strong><br/><u>Middle East</u>: The main stronghold for the Arabian Leopard (<span><em>P. p. nimr</em>) is the continuous tract of the Dhofar area in southwestern Oman and the Hawf area in northeastern Yemen (Khorozyan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Spalton <em>et al </em>2014). There are also small, isolated populations in Saudi Arabia (Zaffar-ul-Islam <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In 2006, Leopard populations were estimated at eight individuals in Israel's Judean Desert and Negev Highlands respectively, however, they have not been confirmed since (Perez <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The species is likely extirpated in the Musandam Peninsula of Oman and UAE (J. Spalton pers. comm. 2014, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards are probably extinct in Jordan (Qarqaz and Abu Baker 2006), UAE (Edmonds <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006) and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), with the possibility of rare forays from the Negev (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/><em><strong>Southwest Asia and the Caucasus</strong></em><br/>Recent surveys found that Leopards have a wide distribution in Iran, mostly in the region of the two mountain chains consisting of Alborz running northwest to northeast and Zagros from northwest to the south (Sanei and Zakaria 2011). Their presence is also recorded in Golestan National Park, Iran which is located in the northeastern part of Iran near the border with Turkmenistan (Erfanian <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). A few recently confirmed records from Iraq and Turkey are restricted to the mountainous areas of Kurdistan (B. Avgan and H. Raza pers. comms. 2014), where Leopard is known to be scarce. There are numerous camera-trap records dated 2013-2014 confirming the presence of a small population in the Zangezur Ridge shared by Armenia and Azerbaijan (B. Avgan and A. Malkhasyan pers. comms. 2014, Voskanyan 2014, Sarukhanova 2014). Two individuals are recorded in Talysh Mountains of southeastern Azerbaijan (Sarukhanova 2014). There is recent camera trapping evidence from Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan (Avgan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Recently, a Leopard was video-trapped in North Ossetia, Georgia (P. Weinberg pers. comm. 2014). There are no confirmed recent records in Dagestan although Leopards definitely lived here in low numbers in the 1980s and the last confirmed photograph was taken in 2009 (Yarovenko 2010, Y. Yarovenko pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><u>South and Central Asia</u>: There is some indication of its presence in the Babatag and Kugitang mountains of Uzbekistan (N. Marmazinskaya pers. comm. 2014). A confirmed record of Leopard was obtained in Afghanistan in the Bamyan province in 2011 in a camera trap image (Moheb and Bradfield 2014). In Pakistan, Leopards also inhabits broken hilly or mountainous country throughout Waziristan, Baluchistan and Sindh Kohistan in association with acacia scrub forest (Roberts 1997). A recent study using DNA from scats found Leopard presence in northeast Pakistan from the Ayubia National Park (Shehzad <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards occur widely in the forests of Bhutan and Nepal. Leopards are widespread across India (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009) and Sri Lanka (A. Kittle and A. Watson pers. comms. 2014) occurring inside and outside Protected Areas.<br/><br/><u>Southeast and East Asia</u>: Leopard range has been significantly reduced in southeast and East Asia. The North China Leopard is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in Central China in the Ningxia, northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, northern Henan, western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Leopards of southeast Asia have been confirmed in protected areas in Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and southern China but are likely absent from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (S. Rostro-Garcia and J.F. Kamler unpubl. data). Some recent information indicates that they are still present in most forested regions of the island of Java, Indonesia but in very low numbers (H. Gunawan and H.A. Wahyudi pers. comms. 2015). In the Russian Far East, Leopards occur in a large area of about 7,000 km² along the eastern slopes of the East Manchurian Mountains on the border with China but their numbers are likely to be very low (Hebblewhite <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<p></p>","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for  medicinal purposes in eastern cultures).",Terrestrial,"The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and products is restricted to 2,560 individuals in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the geographic distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation.&#160; In 2014, sport hunting has been banned altogether in Botswana while South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards&#160;for the year&#160;in&#160;2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source. In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise <em>et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). In 2009, Leopards were protected from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan on the country’s Protected Species List (Zahler pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (G. Balme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Leopard population recovery efforts are currently under way with reintroduction projects in Sochi, Greater Caucasus and the Russian Far East (C. Breitenmoser pers. comm. 2015).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The overall rate of decline in population size over the last 18-24 years (=three generations) was estimated at about 28% by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012), with this rate substantially influenced by a severe decline in inland regions most exposed to recent drought. A separate expert elicitation process involving independent estimates (from 15 Koala experts) of population size in every bioregion inhabited by Koalas concluded that the Koala population size reduction or projected reduction over three generations is a mean of 29%, albeit with substantial variation amongst experts in estimation of this rate (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012). Climate change is expected to lead to an increased rate of population reduction over the next 20-30 years, and the impacts of other threats will magnify over this period. Here we consider that the conservation status of the Koala is border-line between Near Threatened and Vulnerable, but we adopt a precautionary assessment given the proximity of the estimated current and projected rate of decline to the threshold, and published assessments of the likelihood of additional and compound impacts due to climate change (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014)","<p>The Koala is an arboreal folivorous marsupial. It occurs in forests and woodlands, typically dominated by eucalyptus&#160;species. In inland (semi-arid) portions of its range, it occurs mainly in riparian woodlands (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2002, Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011). Elsewhere distribution may be associated particularly with soil fertility (and hence foliage nutrient content) (Moore and Foley 2000). The Koala has a specialist diet, mostly limited to foliage of <em>Eucalyptus</em> species, with occasional intake of leaves of other plant (mostly <em>Myrtaceous</em>) genera (Martin and Handasyde 1999; Moore and Foley 2000, 2005). At high population densities, Koalas can defoliate preferred tree species, causing tree death and subsequent Koala population crash (Menkhorst 2004, 2008).<br/><br/>The Koala is mostly solitary, but individuals have extensive overlap in home ranges. Home range size varies substantially with forest structure and productivity, and males typically have larger home ranges than females. In a coastal forest in New South Wales, average home range size was 10 ha (for females) to 20 ha (for males) (Lassau <em>et al</em>. 2008); in inland Queensland home ranges were 100 ha (for females) to 135 ha (for males) (Ellis<em> et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Breeding is seasonal, with births (typically of single young) in October-May. Females can produce young at annual intervals, but births per adult female per year average 0.3-0.8 (McLean 2003). Sexual maturity is reached at 18 months (Jackson 2007). In the wild, longevity of 12 (for males) to 15 years (for females) has been reported (Martin and Handasyde 1999). Generation length is 6-8 years (Phillips 2000).</p>","Current threats to this species include continued habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification (which makes them vulnerable to predation by dogs, vehicle strikes, and other factors), bushfires, and disease, as well as drought associated mortality in habitat fragments. Public concern for the species is high. There are management problems with many populations; remnant populations living at high densities in isolated patches of habitat are at greatest risk (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Effective management of some of the threats on the mainland could lead to excessive abundance and result in pest problems similar to those occurring on Kangaroo Island and in parts of Victoria.<br/><br/>The overall distribution of Koalas has been reduced since European settlement. This decline was primarily due to disease, bushfires, and widespread habitat destruction in the early decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Commercial harvesting also took place across the range towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century (large numbers, running into the millions, were killed for their pelts for a large export industry in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland). This was banned in Victoria in the 1890s, and it continued sporadically (and under regulation) in Queensland until 1927 (Hrdina and Gordon 2004). There is no evidence, however, that the early spate of commercial harvesting had any long-term impact on the overall population.&#160;Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species&#160;(Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012).","There are robust population estimates for some regions, notably the Mulga Lands of southwest Queensland (for which a 2009 estimate is about 12,000 individuals: Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011). More broadly, Queensland EPA (2006) estimated the Koala population size in Queensland in 2006 at between 100,000 and 300,000 individuals. In its 2012 listing advice, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012) provided State-based ‘best estimates’ of population size in 2010, tallying to between 347,000 and 518,000 individuals across all States. Some other sources have concluded that the population size is &lt;100,000 individuals (see The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee 2011). A recent expert-based elicitation process provided an aggregated mean estimate of 330,000 individuals across the Koala’s current range (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012), suggesting the number of mature individuals is <em>c</em>. 300,000.<br/><br/>Population densities are very variable between regions and across time: examples include 1-3 individuals/ha in coastal forests in south-eastern Queensland (Queensland EPA 2006), 0.01/ha in central Queensland (Melzer <em>et al</em>. 2000), 0.006/ha in coastal forests of south-eastern New South Wales (Jurskis and Potter 1997), and &gt;5/ha in forests on Kangaroo Island prior to population control (Masters <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Koala subpopulations may show marked fluctuation, with severe crashes associated with over-browsing (Menkhorst 2004, 2008) and with long periods of low rainfall or episodes of very high temperatures (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1988, Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Gordon <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered the overall direction for population trend for Koalas to be unknown. However, the evidence for overall reduction in population size over the past three generations is compelling, given sustained management to reduce or stabilize population density of the largest South Australian subpopulation, demonstration of major decline in parts of inland Queensland (notably in the Mulga Lands, where population size decreased over recent decades by 80%: Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011), and in much of the coastal range of south-eastern Queensland (e.g. 68% decline in the ‘Koala Coast’ region from 1999 to 2010) and New South Wales. However, trends in these regions are not necessarily typical of the broader range, and population trends may also vary between different subpopulations within regions: for example, while most monitored Queensland subpopulations have experienced decline over the last two decades, a low density population at Oakey on the eastern Darling Downs has shown relative stability in population size (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012; G. Gordon pers. comm. 2014). Likewise, in New South Wales, subpopulations in coastal regions have declined (some, including around Eden and Iluka, to extirpation or nearly so), but there are several subpopulations (including Lismore, Campbelltown and Southern Highlands) that are relatively stable.<br/><br/>Regional-level population size and trend estimates were collated by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012), based on information from sites with known population density information (or estimates of number of individuals in subpopulations) and monitoring results, extrapolated to regional scale, and summed over regions, with some sensitivity analysis. These estimates indicate a 20-year (1990-2010) decline in population size nationally of about 28%, with that decline greatest in low rainfall areas of western Queensland exposed to drought conditions. A summary of their interpretation of population status and trends is given in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material. The major uncertainties in these estimates of population trends arise from the wide range of estimates for the size of the Victorian subpopulations, and to the imprecision of extrapolations of limited site-specific data to broader regional trends.<br/>&#160;<br/>A separate and subsequent independent assessment of population size and trends was provided by McAlpine <em>et al</em>. (2012), based on an expert elicitation process (e.g. McBride <em>et al</em>. 2012) involving 15 experts in Koala ecology and management across the Koala’s range. Although some state-based population size estimates differed from those given by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, this process reported a remarkably similar estimate of overall decline in population size of 28.6% in three generational periods (over a ‘sliding time window of the past three generations and the future three generations of koala (15-21 years)’), although with very wide bounds around the relevant population size and trend estimates (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). These wide bounds are indicative of substantial disagreements between experts concerning population size and trends, and the sparse and not necessarily representative monitoring data for some subpopulations. Note also that McAlpine <em>et al</em>. (2012) used a 5-7 year period for generational length, in contrast to the 6-8 year period reported by Phillips (2000).<br/><br/>With respect to eligibility against IUCN criteria, it could be argued that the decline over the last three generations has been driven mainly by the impacts of a severe drought, that has now ceased, and hence that the relevant criterion is A1, for which a decline of &gt;50% in the relevant 20 year time frame would be required for eligibility. However, drought has been only one of many factors driving decline across the Koala’s range. Furthermore, the ability of inland Koala populations to recover from this recent drought is likely to be severely compromised by widespread tree death and the legacy impacts of vegetation clearance which will constrain options for repopulation of now fragmented habitat (Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011; Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012). Other threats will continue to cause broad-scale population decline across much of the Koala’s range, and the impacts of at least some of these threats may be expected to be exacerbated by climate change (Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012).",Decreasing,"The Koala was formerly common throughout the broad band of forests and woodlands dominated by <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. extending from north Queensland to the south-eastern corner of mainland South Australia, Australia (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Currently it occurs in northeastern, central, and southeastern Queensland with patchy populations in western areas; eastern New South Wales including the coastal strip and highlands of the Great Dividing Range, as well as the western plains and related riparian environments where suitable habitat occurs; Victoria; and southeastern South Australia. Its total geographic range has contracted significantly due to loss of large areas of habitat since European settlement. In Queensland, extent of occurrence and area of occupancy have contracted by about 30% (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>The Koala has been introduced to at least 12 islands including: Kangaroo (South Australia, 450,000 ha), French (Victoria, 17,470 ha), Phillip (Victoria, 10,116 ha), and Magnetic (Queensland, 5,200 ha) (Abbott and Burbidge 1995). It has also been introduced within the mainland in the Adelaide Region and along the Murray River (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).","Formerly Koala subpopulations were severely depleted by hunting (for furs), with millions killed. This hunting continued up to 1927 in Queensland (Hrdina and Gordon 2004, Gordon and Hrdina 2005, Gordon <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>There is no national recovery plan; however there is a national conservation and management strategy (NRMMC 2009), a recovery plan for the Koala in New South Wales (NSW DECC 2008), a management strategy in Victoria (Menkhorst 2004), and a conservation plan and management program for the Koala in Queensland (Queensland EPA 2006).<br/><br/>A recent parliamentary inquiry concluded that the national conservation and management strategy was largely ineffective (The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee 2011).<br/><br/>In part because of its iconic status, there has been a relatively long history of conservation management directed specifically at the Koala (e.g. Menkhorst 2004, 2008; Queensland EPA 2006; New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change 2008; Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council 2010). This has included a substantial history of translocations, including conservation marooning and re-introduction (mostly in Victoria, Menkhorst 2008) and introduction (mostly in South Australia: Masters <em>et al</em>. 2004), some land management and forestry prescriptions, monitoring, substantial research, and localized management of some threats. There are numerous captive breeding facilities in Australia, and internationally.</p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Furthermore, linear infrastructure (e.g. roads, railways, canals) - if not carefully designed and mitigated - are likely to result in high mortalities if Wild Asses are impeded in their long-distance movements and become cut-off from important resources or refuge areas. Mongolia, which currently houses over 75% of the global population, is at a crossroad and the outcome will depend on Mongolia’s ability to become “a global model for demonstrating that major economic development projects can proceed without degrading ungulate migrations” (Batsaikhan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Though global dynamics are primarily driven by the large Mongolian population, locally there are both increasing and decreasing trends with some populations in Turkmenistan, Iran, Kazakhstan and China being threatened with immediate extinction. Furthermore, several population estimates are rather old and methods are rarely standardized. Consequentially, the different subspecies have also been assessed individually.","Asiatic Wild Asses inhabit mountain steppe, steppe, semi-desert and desert plains, but nowadays have become mainly confined to the low productivity semi-desert and desert plains (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Wild Asses can be found in hill country and are able to cross over mountain ranges, but generally seem to avoid steeper terrain, particularly slopes &gt;20° (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Asses are predominately grazers. During the dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Asses will supplement their diet with shrubs and switch to become mixed-feeders during certain seasons (Bannikov 1981, Xu <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Burnik-Sturm in prep.). Wild Asses, like all equids, need regular access to water and in captivity drink 1,020 litres daily, although they seem to be able to go without water for two to four days depending on ambient temperature and moisture content of the feed (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Water availability is a key resource and in summer months the species primarily occurs within 10-15 km of standing water. In Mongolia where the ground water level is high, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>Wild Asses are highly mobile, in the Mongolian Gobi collared animals covered average daily straight line distances of 11.9 km (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) or cumulative distances of 21.8 km (Kaczensky unpubl. data) within 24 hours. Wild Ass movements do not seem to follow easily predictable patterns (classical migration), but are rather nomadic. This is likely the result of the unpredictability in the availability of pasture and water in space and time (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, von Wehrden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In the past, when Wild Asses still occurred on mountain steppe and steppe habitats, they made seasonal migrations between summer ranges on the productive steppe habitats in the north to winter ranges in the drier, but less snowy areas in the south (Bannikov 1981).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Asses in Mongolia have huge annual ranges, the size of which increase from east to west, likely as a result of increasing unpredictability of pasture and water availability. In the Dzungarian Gobi annual ranges averaged 5,860 km<sup>2</sup>, in the Transaltai Gobi they ranged between 14,695-16,907&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, but in the southeast Gobi ranged from 18,186-69,988&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, Batsaikhan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Age at first reproduction seems to be three years for mares and five years for stallions. Mares can produce a foal annually under favourable conditions up to at least 15 years of age. Sex-ratio at birth is close to 50/50 (Bannikov 1981, Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Volf 2010). Area specific data of Asiatic Wild Ass population dynamics parameters are largely lacking or anecdotal. For the re-introduced and intensively studied population on Barsa Kelmes Island average fertility of adult mares was estimated at 66.6%, but varied depending on pasture condition and winter severity (Bannikov 1981). Foal survival in the wild likely is in the magnitude of 50% and yearling survival is lower than adult survival (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Nowzari <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Kaczensky pers. obs.). Age determination of 350 skulls of Asiatic Wild Ass carcasses from the Mongolian Gobi documented a mean age of 9.1 years (for animals ≥3 years) and a maximum age of 29 years (Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Average annual foal rates seem to be somewhere in the range of 1,020% (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The species is polygynous and thus only a portion of the adult males contributes to reproduction, though what percentage is unknown, particularly as there is still limited understanding of the social organization of the species (Solomatin 1973, Bannikov 1981, Rubenstein 1986, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Klingel 1998 Shah 1993, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002 Neumann-Denzau and Denzau 2007, Rubenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Shah and Qureshi, 2007, Sundaresan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Data on population composition and age specific mortality rates are unavailable and most surveys did not state if and how foals were included in the estimates. Without more robust population dynamics data we assumed that the number of mature individuals roughly equals 50% of the total population making for a global population of mature animals of 27,900 animals.<br/><br/>We also compared our estimate with the known population composition of one re-introduced Przewalski’s horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalski</em>) population that shares part of the range of Asiatic Wild Asses in the Mongolian Gobi and nine Cape mountain zebra populations in South Africa. In the Przewalski’s horse population the proportion of mature individuals (≥3 years for mares and ≥5 years for stallions) averaged 61% (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data 2009, 2014) and for the Cape Mountain zebra populations ranged between 55-65% (S. King pers. comm. 2014, based on H. Hrabar unpubl. data).","Threats to Asiatic Wild Asses stem from illegal hunting for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties (Bannikov 1981, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), competition with humans and livestock over water and pasture use (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006), and crop depredation (primarily in India, Iran and Turkmenistan; S. Esmaeili pers. comm. 2013, N. Shah pers. comm. 2014, N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014, Feh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Other threats are habitat loss as a result of human settlement and cultivation, overgrazing and degradation, and limited access to open water sources (the mere presence of people and their livestock at water points can limit or block access for wild ass; Denzau and Denzau 1999, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Of increasing concern is the continued habitat fragmentation by linear infrastructure development projects (mostly roads and railways) associated with the booming extractive industry in Mongolia and China. Asiatic Wild Asses are unable to cross fences (e.g. along the border between Mongolia and China or Iran and Turkmenistan, or fenced transportation corridors like the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway), have long flight distances from vehicles in areas with a high poaching pressure, and suffer from vehicle collisions (e.g., from 2009-2013, 26 Wild Asses were killed by traffic in Israel; Waner 2014). If not mitigated, fenced and/or high volume traffic corridors can be expected to create serious movement barriers (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have become largely confined to semi-desert and desert areas with a high variability in water and pasture availability. To cope with this unpredictable environment and track the scarce resources available, Wild Asses need to have access to large tracts of land. This is particularly true in times of weather extremes, when&#160;Wild Asses&#160;need to outrun summer droughts or extreme winters (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b). Although protected areas may provide important refuges, long-term conservation of&#160;Wild Asses&#160;will have to happen on the landscape scale. New planning tools are needed, like the “planning for a moving target” approach suggested for Saiga (<em>Saiga tatarica</em>) in Kazakhstan (Singh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Bull <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable and prone to extinction, particularly in habitats with frequent environmental extremes (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Small and localised populations also have limited resilience to disease outbreaks&#160;or climate change. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963).<br/><br/><strong>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:</strong><br/><br/>The main threats to Khulan in <strong>Mongolia </strong>remain competition for water and pasture with livestock. The temporally high illegal offtake in Mongolia seems to have largely ceased, but could be resumed if the economic situation becomes unstable. Newly emerging threats are rapid infrastructure development particularly in connection with resource extraction industries (mining) that could result in barriers to migrations/nomadic movements (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) and habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of mining operation tapping into “ancient” aquifers on the active ground water table are not fully understood. The situation is complicated by a lack of capacity and funding to implement landscape scale planning and conservation. Furthermore, an estimated 60,0000 illegal “ninja” miners are degrading the habitat, polluting water sources and causing huge disturbance, though initiatives are under way transforming ninja mining into a formal sub-sector and developing mercury free processing techniques.<br/><br/>Threats in northern <strong>China </strong>stem from intensified resource extraction which already resulted in the de-gazetting of parts of Kalamaili Nature Reserve, fencing and competition with local herders and their livestock (Xia <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The situation in Gansu province is data deficient and potentially Wild Asses no longer occur in that region. The situation in Inner Mongolia is also unclear, the fence along the international border with Mongolia currently inhibits population exchange between the two countries.<br/><br/>Threats to Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch in <strong>India </strong>stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Mega Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area (Goyal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is having an impact on the micro-habitat, the short grasslands and is restricting the movement of Khur and other species across the saline desert. Increased agricultural practices have converted fallow lands into irrigation fields, resulting in shrinking habitat for the existing Khur population. Religious activities, cattle breeding and influx of people have accelerated on the Islands or Bets of the Rann.<em> Prosopis juliflora</em> invasion is an additional threat to the habitat. An estimated 30-35% of the Khur population lives outside the protected area and human-Khur conflicts are increasing, particularly crop raiding. In recent years Khur have also been increasingly hit on the major express highway. The International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting any possibility of Khur movement beyond borders. Although the population has somewhat increased over the past years, foaling rates in Khur have been on the decline in recent years (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014). <br/><br/>In <strong>Kazakhstan </strong>Kulan in Altyn Emel National Park are thriving, but are believed to have reached carrying capacity. Transfers to Andassay Sanctuary have been resumed, but the status and whereabouts of the reintroduced animals is largely unknown due to a lack of post-release management. Poaching still seems to be a threat outside of Altyn Emel National Park.<br/><br/>In <strong>Iran </strong>upgrading the core zone of Bahram-e-Goor protected area to Qatrouiyeh National Park and providing water supplies and occasional hay resulted in an increase of the Onager population. In contrast, the large adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area seems to act as a sink for the population due to occupation of water sources and productive ranges by livestock coupled with insufficient capacity for ranger presence and patrolling. As a result, the Onager population is concentrated in Qatrouyeh national park, which is starting to show signs of high herbivory pressure from Onagers. In Touran protected area the distribution range and abundance of Onagers have been decreasing. Occupation of suitable Onager habitats by livestock, poaching (usually by chasing the animal by motorbike) and insufficient protection are the most important threats to the species in this reserve.<br/><br/>The situation of Kulan in <strong>Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>Uzbekistan </strong>is largely data deficient. The accuracy of population estimates and the distribution range are unclear. The border fence with Iran and Afghanistan does not allow for cross-border movements to the south any more. The autochthonous population in the Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area is declining. Large parts of the Wild Ass population in Badkhyz leave the Strictly Protected Area in summer to access water sources like the Kuska or Islim rivers close to the Afghan border. Outside the protected area, competition with livestock and crop raiding leads to conflicts with the local population. Poaching remains a problem and harassment by shepherds and their dogs and overgrazing by livestock limits Kulan access to pastures and water outside the reserve (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The reintroduced wild ass population in <strong>Israel </strong>lives in an extremely arid environment prone to droughts and in summer there are only three permanent water sources (all artificial) within the current distribution area. Presently the major known mortality cause is Wild Ass vehicle collisions. Although population size has doubled since 1999, an increase in the probability of extreme events under the predicted climate change scenario may still make this population vulnerable to extinction as modelled by Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006). Another simulation model, based on changes in allele frequencies, suggests that a strong polygynous mating system is leading to increased genetic drift (Renan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).","Population estimates of Asiatic Wild Asses are based on a wide variety of different field methods and estimation techniques ranging from attempted total counts based on ground transects or counts at strategically important habitat features (e.g. water points, winter range), population estimates based on strip transects or line transects either from the ground or air, and sign surveys. Details on survey design or details on the statistical procedures that lead to the final population estimates were rarely available. Funds and capacity for monitoring are often very limited and several population estimates are rather old. Consequently, estimates provided should be treated as best available information on the magnitude of the Wild Ass populations and their trends in the respective countries.<br/><br/>Free ranging Asiatic Wild Ass populations currently occur in eight countries in 17 more or less isolated populations with an estimated global population of 55,000 animals.<br/><br/>The largest remaining Wild Ass population, found in southern Mongolia and parts of adjacent China, had been estimated at 18,411 (± 898) for Mongolia in 2003 based on ground transects (Lhagvasuren 2007). However, new counts suggest that this survey greatly underestimated the population due to methodological constrains of covering such a huge area on the ground. A large-scale aerial survey estimated 32,843 (± 10,571) Wild Asses over 150,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the southeast Gobi in 2013 (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) plus likely an additional 1,723 Wild Asses in the no-flight buffer zone along the Mongolian-Chinese border based on a parallel ground survey (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Three large-scale spring time ground surveys resulted in comparable population estimates of 35,899 (18 %CV) in 2013, 39,998 (27%CV) in 2014, and 36,298 (27%CV) in 2015 (Buuveibaatar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.) A simultaneous point count in 2010 estimated another 5,671 (3611–8907) Wild Asses over 11,027 km<sup>2</sup> in the Dzungarian Gobi (Ransom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). These data suggest a population of over 40,000 individuals in Mongolia, with likely an additional 1,500 in the Transaltai Gobi as there have been no reported changes there since the 1997 aerial survey (Reading <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2001), plus further animals in the eastern Gobi, giving an estimate of over 42,000 animals. Based on these updated population estimates, Mongolia houses 75% of the global population of Asiatic Wild Ass. Genetic analysis of samples collected from 2002–2005 suggested gene flow over the entire range in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), but this may have been compromised by recent infrastructure development.<br/><br/>An additional ~5,000 Wild Asses are believed to occur in adjacent China, primarily in Xinjiang province (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). With the upgrading of the fence along the international border in the 1980s and 1990s, population exchange between Mongolia and China has likely ceased or at least become minimal (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011a, Kaczensky unpubl. data). Consequently, the Chinese populations should be regarded as separate from Mongolia.<br/><br/>The third largest population is found in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007). In 2009 the official estimate for this population was ~4,000 animals (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The fourth largest population is found in Altyn Emel National Park in southeast Kazakhstan. This population was re-established via reintroductions and is currently estimated at ~2,500-3,000 animals (Plakhov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, S.V. Sokolov pers. comm. 2011, R. Habibrakhmanov pers. comm. 2014). Two additional, isolated reintroduced populations are found in Kazakhstan: 1) on Barsa-Kelmes Island with an estimated ~347 animals (Meldebekov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 2) in Andassay Sanctuary with an estimated ~35 animals (Levanov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The total population in Kazakhstan is approximately 3,100 animals.<br/><br/>The fifth largest population is found in Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in south-central Iran, estimated at 632 (429-939) individuals of which 15% were foals in summer 2014 (M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014). While the Bahram-e-Gour population has shown a positive trend in recent years, the second population in the Touran protected area complex in northern Iran seems to have severely decreased to a mere ~145 animals (summer census 2014 - M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Any potential exchange with the population in adjacent Turkmenistan is inhibited by the fence along the international border. A recent reintroduction resulted in 12 free-ranging animals in Kalmand protected area. The total population in Iran is around 790 animals.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan Wild Asses only survived in Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area, bordering Iran and Afghanistan. The 2013 estimate for Badkhyz was ~420 individuals (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014), a 50% reduction in the population since the 2008 assessment. Rapid assessments from 2012, 2014 and 2015 suggest that the population may be even lower than 420 individuals (Kuznetsov pers. comm. 2015, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015). From Badkhyz Wild Asses were reintroduced to multiple other localities within Turkmenistan (Pavlov 1996, Lukarevskiy and Gorelov. 2007). The reintroduction to the Sarykamysh reserve was the most successful and the population is estimated at ~300-350 animals, also spreading into adjacent Uzbekistan where another ~50 animals are believed to live (Kuznetsov 2014, N. Marmazinskaja unpubl. data 2012/2013). The other reintroduction sites are all in the south, with an estimated ~100 animals in Meana Chaacha Reserve, ~13 in Western Kopetdag, and ~10-15 in Kuruhaudan (V. Kuznetsov unpubl. data 2012 and 2013). The total population in Turkmenistan and adjacent Uzbekistan is about 920 animals.<br/><br/>The reintroduced population in the Negev in Israel is currently estimated at 250 animals (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Two projects reintroduced Wild Ass populations into large enclosures – so called semi-reserves. The Dzheiran Ecocentre in Uzbekistan is 51 km<sup>2</sup> and houses a population of 98 animals (N. Soldatova unpubl. data 2013) and the Birjutschii peninsula in Ukraine is 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and houses 91 animals (Pavlov 1996, O. Yaremchenko pers. comm. 2014). However, these populations were not included in the IUCN Red List assessment. The planned reintroduction in Taif, Saudi Arabia never happened and no animals remain at the enclosure (Denzau and Denzau 1999, Int. Studbook Of Asiatic Wild Asses - Onager Studbook).<br/><br/>The population trend since the last Red List assessment in 2008 seems more or less stable in Mongolia, is data deficient in China, seems stable or slightly increasing in India, shows a mixed trend in Iran (with Touran dramatically decreasing, but Bahram-e-Goor increasing), is increasing or stable in Kazakhstan,&#160;data deficient&#160;in Turkmenistan (decrease in Badkhyz, but increase in Sarykamysh Reserve), increasing in Uzbekistan from Sarykamysh Reserve, and increasing in Israel.<br/><br/>See Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged throughout the steppes and desert steppes of the Russian Federation, Mongolia, northern China, northwest India, Central Asia, the Middle East, including Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor (Bannikov 1981, Heptner <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>1988, Denzau and Denzau 1999). Today the species' main stronghold is southern Mongolia and adjacent China. All other remaining populations are small and largely isolated from each other. One subspecies, the Syrian Wild Ass (<em>E. h. hemippus</em>), became extinct in 1927.<br/> <br/> <em>Equus hemionus</em> may have lost as much as 70% of its range since the 19th century and is now regionally extinct in most of its former range countries primarily due to competition with livestock for pastures and water and severe over-hunting (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). The largest remaining population is found in southern Mongolia (Reading <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Ransom <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,Norton-Griffiths&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and parts of adjacent China (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007), the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan (Lukarevski and Gorelov 2007) and in the Touran protected area complex and Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in Iran (Tatin <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2003, Hemami and Momeni 2013). <br/> <br/> The species has been re-established via reintroductions in Kazakhstan and Israel. Additional reintroductions have somewhat re-expanded its range in Turkmenistan (also spreading into Uzbekistan) and established two populations in large enclosures in Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The re-established population in Israel is not of the subspecies that originally occurred there, but rather of mixed <em>E. h. kulan</em> and <em>E. h. onager</em> origin (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014).<p></p>","Illegal trade seems to happen primarily on a national level and stem from poaching for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties.<br/><br/>Illegal off-take in Mongolia peaked in the early 2000s and also included large scale market hunting (Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em>et al.</em> 2007), but currently seems to be much reduced. However, illegal off-take has been identified as a key threat in parts of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran and China and may well drive some of the small populations into extinction if not stopped.",Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Wild Ass is legally protected in all range countries. CITES has listed the subspecies <em>E.h. hemionus</em> (Mongolian Khulan) and <em>E.h. khur</em> (Indian Khur) on Appendix I and all other subspecies on Appendix II since 1975. The full species is listed on Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2013. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) listed the species on Appendix II in 2002 (UNEP/CMS 2002b). The&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;is one of the key species in the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI) of CMS (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>In all range countries protected areas have been established with the goal to protect&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses. However, almost all protected areas seem too small to sustain a population year-round or accommodate population recovery. At the fringes of protected areas conflicts with the local population tend to be increasing and/or Asiatic Wild Asses are subject to high levels of illegal killing. Consequently, landscape scale planning and integrative approaches that also take local people’s needs into account are needed for future conservation planning. Unfortunately China just de-gazetted substantial parts of the Kalamaili Nature reserve, a major stronghold of wild asses in Xinjiang, to allow coal mining (Xia <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area in Turkmenistan (M. Day pers. comm. 2014) and the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia (T. Jaeger pers. comm. 2014) have been listed as possible candidate sites for nomination as UNESCO world heritage sites. For Badkhyz an expansion of the State Nature Reserve, additional adjacent nature reserves and an ecological corridor safeguarding the seasonal migrations of&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are being currently implemented. A ‘transboundary ecological corridor’ connecting Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang province in China, and Great Gobi A and B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia via the limited entry border area of northern Xinjiang and southern Mongolia has been suggested to re-establish transboundary&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;movements (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011a, Xu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but will likely fail without political lobbying.<br/><br/>Although rapid infrastructure development is likely creating one of the biggest challenges for the conservation of migratory and nomadic ungulates, No Net Loss (NNL) or Net Positive Impact (NPI) policies adopted by industry, and newly emerging standards on Biodiversity Offsets (BBOP 2012) are powerful tools that may enable economic development to combine with biodiversity conservation, and offsets may actually provide a more flexible tool to conserve nomadic species (Bull <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In Mongolia, the largest mine Oyu Tolgoi is operating on a NPI policy and&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are a key species of concern.<br/><br/>Reintroductions have re-established the&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Israel and somewhat expanded its range in Turkmenistan. The reintroduced populations contribute ~8% to the global population, but only managed to reoccupy a tiny fraction of the species former range. New reintroductions are currently discussed in Kazakhstan and Iran. However, care has to be taken that reintroduction projects do not distract attention and funds from conserving the remaining autochthonous populations.<br/><br/>Whereas increasing monitoring and research efforts are made in Mongolia, Israel, Xinjiang province in China, India and Bahram-e-Goor in Iran, little systematic information is available from Inner Mongolia and Gansu province in China, Touran protected area complex in Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Furthermore, major research gaps exist regarding: i) the human dimension of&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;management and conservation, ii) site specific population dynamics parameters, iii) triggers, drivers, and scale of nomadic or seasonal movements, iv) impact and mitigation of barriers.<br/><br/>A Programme of Work for the CMS Central Asian Mammal Initiative (CAMI) was agreed during the Stakeholder Meeting on the Conservation of Large Mammals in Central Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (2325 September 2014) and included a recommendation to develop a single-species action plan for the Asiatic Wild Ass as a high priority.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However it may be undergoing some localised declines because of&#160;habitat loss and fragmentation.","The Cacomistle is nocturnal, arboreal, and solitary. It feeds on fruits, insects, and probably small vertebrates. It uses&#160;the middle and upper levels of tropical forests. It is found in both montane and lowland rain forest, in wet evergreen forest as well as seasonally dry forest, scrub, and secondary forest (Glatston 1994).","Loss of habitat due to deforestation is a major threat. In Mexico the rate of forest clearance is tremendously high and forest fragmentation is also a major problem. In addition, it is hunted in Honduras and Mexico for its fur and for meat by indigenous people (Nowak 2005).","The status of its population is unknown. It is suspected to be uncommon over much of its range (Glatston 1994), but it can be locally common. It is common in the remnant forests of Veracruz, but it is rare in Panama (Emmons and Feer 1990).

170905827,42191,Muntiacus reevesi,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species has been considered Least Concern by previous assessments however the supporting justification for this is rather weak. For the 2016 reassessment Least Concern is again used, however with reservations; the species might well be better considered either Near Threatened or less likely Vulnerable on the basis of presumed declines that are likely to have taken place. Status assessment is complicated, the species has a relatively wide range in China, and threats faced by the species there vary very significantly between regions. In Taiwan and some better-managed reserves in mainland China for instance the populations appears to be stable, but in other parts of mainland China declines have probably been severe mainly due to hunting pressure; habitat loss potentially could be a more serious threat in some regions. The assessment of status is further complicated by presumed wide overlap with the Northern Red Muntjac <em>M. vaginalis </em>and quite possibly also animals in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species complex. <br/><br/>In addition, it should be noted that some of the reason for the relative lack of concern for this species may stem from its abundance in the UK rather than from its status in its native range in China and Taiwan. This species should be re-assessed should additional information on its status become available.","The species is adaptable and occurs in temperate forests with occasional snowfall as well as in dense forests in the warm subtropical zone. In China, Reeves’s Muntjac has been reported to occupy rocky places and open woodlands of pine and oak. It seeks cover in steep ravines, and usually has well defined areas to which it retreats (Smith and Xie 2008). It has also been reported to reach the highest densities in low mountains and hilly areas, at forest edges and in shrubby habitats (Sheng 1992). However, in Taiwan, it is found mostly in forested areas (Pei and Chiang 2004), typically in primary forest with dense canopy cover and it tends to avoid steep terrain (Chiang 2007). It is distributed over a wide elevation range, from near sea level to 3,500 m asl in habitats ranging from subtropical lowlands to coniferous forests/alpine grassland at the highest altitudes. However, there is a decreasing trend in abundance with increasing altitude (Chiang 2007). The species is basically solitary, although sometimes found in pairs or small family groups. Home ranges average about 100 ha, overlap considerably, and do not vary in size by gender. Females mature within the first year, with the majority of females reaching sexually maturity at eight months (Sheng 1992). It appears to lack strong seasonality in reproduction (Sheng 1992, Hayssen<em><em> et al.</em></em> 1993, Smith and Xie 2008). Gestation is 209-220 days. It grows new antlers in summer (peaking in June and July) (Pei and Liu 1994) (Sheng 1992, Pei and Chiang 2004) although velvet antlers were sporadically found throughout the year (Pei and Chiang 2004). In Taiwan, camera trapping data in remote areas with least human activities showed that Reeves’s Muntjac in Taiwan is crepuscular with significantly more diurnal than nocturnal activities (68% vs. 32%, Pei and Chiang 2004), which agreed with radio-telemetry results (McCullough <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000), as well as those from mainland China (Chan unpublished data). It is most active during the 2 hours after sunrise and before sunset and seasonal variations of activity levels were more pronounced in the afternoon (Pei and Chiang 2004).","The major threats to this species include habitat destruction and hunting. It is hunted for food and, before hunting was banned, for hides which were used in the fur market. It remains one of the most heavily hunted large mammals based on news reports of seizures, although one could argue that this indicates the species’ resilience to hunting and habitat degradation (B. Chan pers. comm. 2016). Forest habitat is being lost in many parts of its range, in particular because of agriculture, logging and urbanization. However, there is no information on the overall rate of decline of this very widespread species.","In China, no recent population estimates or estimates of population trend are available. Sheng (1992) estimated over two million animals in the 1980s. It is generally not considered to be highly threatened although the latest China red list categorizes the species as Vulnerable (Jiang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). There is relatively little published information on the species in China, but camera trapping surveys have confirmed the species’ presence in most protected areas within its known range, where it was one of the most frequently detected species (B. Chan pers. comm. 2016). In Taiwan, where it is heavily exploited, the density was estimated at 9.3 animals/km² at elevations around, 2,000 m asl (McCullough <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000), however, in areas without hunting and at lower elevations, the population density could be much higher (Chiang 2007).",Decreasing,"This species in endemic to China including Taiwan Island. In mainland China, this species ranges from Guangdong and Guangxi up to Gansu and Shaanxi, covering the vast subtropical region of the Zhujiang (Pearl) and Yangtze River catchment basins. The exact southern limit of this species is not clear, as old records from tropical Guangdong and Guangxi may be a result of misidentification of <em>Muntiacus muntjak</em>, as in the case of Hong Kong (Hill and Phillipps 1981, Shek 2006). Extensive camera trapping throughout South China in recent years put the southern species limit at north of 25°00’ at northern Guangxi (Chan, B. pers. comm.). The species has been introduced to England (where it is still present) and France (where it is no longer present) (Grubb 2005).",,Terrestrial,"The species seems to be relatively secure in appropriate habitat, but its range is in an area where there is a high human population density and very heavy exploitation of wildlife.
