This decline is ongoing and is likely to result in extinction of this species, projected to occur within the period 2020-2050 if nothing changes.</p>  <p>The Common Hamster's range has declined in almost all European countries. Local and regional extirpations and extinctions have occurred in 13 European countries and in both the European and Asiatic parts of Russia. These include nearly 67% of the range states for this species. The decline does not affect only West European countries, but also affects the global range with declines in Russia and the eastern part of its range evidenced. From the previous assessment in 2016 there has been an estimated decline in the species area of occupancy of 226,835 km² and a 468,634 km² decline in its extent of occurrence.</p><br/><p></p>","Its original habitat was fertile steppe and grassland, but it has successfully spread into a variety of anthropogenic habitats including meadows, croplands (especially cereals), and field edges, road verges and scrubby fallow areas on farms.

At high densities it is considered an agricultural pest in some areas (Nechay 2000).","The causes of the global decline are complex, are not fully understood yet, and there are many hypotheses attempting to explain the breakdown of the species. Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed.  The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered “island populations”.  Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek <em>et al</em>. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye <em>et al</em>. 2012; Neuman <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005; Reiners <em>et al</em>. 2014). Agricultural intensification—specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides—are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli <em>et al</em>. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).  Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston <em>et al</em>. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke <em>et al</em>. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations.","<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has undergone severe range and population declines in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, and now has a highly fragmented distribution in these areas. The decline of the Common Hamster's range and numbers covers its whole distribution range (see Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016 for detailed analysis with maps). Extirpations and extinction on local and regional scales have occurred in a number of countries including Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (Ambros <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bihari 2003, Demyanchik 2004, Ziomek and Banaszek 2007, Tkadlec <em>et </em>al. 2012, Sidorov <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rusin <em>et al</em>. 2013, Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is extinct in Switzerland (Hediger 1944, Mohr 1954, no recent records) and most probably in Georgia, where it was present in one locality (Vinogradov and Gromov 1952, Bukhnikashvili and Kandaurov 2004). To the best knowledge of the assessors, it was never present in Luxembourg which was listed as country of occurrence in the previous assessment.<br/><br/>In general, decline was shown in each country where monitoring of the species was performed. The relative occurrence of the Common Hamster before and after 1970 was compared in Russian, Belarus and Ukrainian provinces, and Moldova. Before 1970, the Common Hamster was abundant in 28 provinces, common in 37 and rare in 20. Today, the species is abundant only in eight and common in 27 provinces, but it is rare in 42 and extinct in eight provinces. Moreover, the species' range is becoming or is already fragmented, due to it vanishing from more than 75% of its range in Central and Eastern Europe. There are only seven fragments in eastern part of the range where the species is common or abundant: two are in Ukraine, one in Caucasus, two in Volga and Ural area and two in Siberia. Nevertheless, the most important fact is that population decline and fragmentation in general concerns the whole eastern range (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has a large global range, extending from Western Europe, through Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Kazakhstan, reaching as far East as the Yenisey river (Asian Russia).

123789863,2815,Bison bison,Near Threatened,C2a(i),2017,2016-09-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is listed as Near Threatened in light of its dependence on ongoing conservation program to persist beyond the next 5 years, a very limited number of viable populations (five), and large number of small (13 of 20 less than 400) isolated populations. The North America bison population underwent a drastic decline in the 19th century caused by over hunting but has since partially recovered. There has been a modest increases in the number of conservation herds and individuals in populations managed for species conservation and ecological restoration, however, all mature individuals occur within active management programs which if ceased would result in the species qualifying for a threatened status. About 97% of the continental population is managed for private captive commercial propagation; very few of these herds are managed primarily for species conservation and none is managed in the public interest for conservation. Herds managed for conservation purposes in the public interest are typically small (&lt;400), and populations are widely dispersed with few geographic situations that provide conditions for natural movements between subpopulations. The total number of mature individuals in wild free-ranging and semi-free-ranging populations is estimated to be approximately 11,248-13,123 and only 4 subpopulations have more than 1,000 individuals, thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). The species is not currently in decline but wild mature individuals could be greatly reduced if current management regimes are changed or removed. This is a conservation dependant species.<br/> <br/> The current number of ecologically restored large populations managed primarily for conservation (populations exceeding 1,000 and managed in the presence of most natural limiting factors) is small. The species is most limited in Mexico, where only one herd may remain in the wild; it is subject to adverse policies when individuals move across the international border into the United States where they are classified as livestock. Creation of opportunities for a few additional, large-scale ecological restoration projects is dependent on cooperation between government agencies and non-government organizations. Future progress in conservation and recovery of the North American bison will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by federal and state/provincial agencies, harmonization of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organizations, and public tolerance and support of wild, free-ranging bison managed as wildife on limited, large-scale landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different agencies or organizations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">The likelihood of wild bison increasing over the next five years is entirely dependent upon conservation interventions.&#160;Currently six of the 20 wild herds representing 11,956 animals (63.7%) are anchored by National Parks, Refuges or Sanctuaries. Without these large protected landscapes bison would not likely survive and the future survival of American bison would be in serious jeopardy. Beyond these 6 herds in protected areas the remaining 14 wild herds are dependent upon conservation actions and management decisions by conservation programs of States, Tribes and Provinces who regulate the populations to assure sustainability of these herds.&#160;None of the 20 wild bison herds would persist without the management prescriptions and subsequent actions of the managing authorities.&#160;Wood bison are currently protected under the Species at Risk Act and are managed under a National Recovery Strategy.&#160;Hence, wild bison (wood or plains) are totally dependent upon conservation actions and protected lands.&#160;American Bison would not persist without those intensive conservation measures.</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">North American bison are primarily grazers and forage primarily in grassland and meadow vegetative communities. They had the widest natural range of any North American herbivore, from the arid grasslands of Chihuahua State in northern Mexico, through the grasslands of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, to the riparian meadows of interior Alaska. They can persist in arid regions (e.g. Mexico and New Mexico) and in areas experiencing deep snow cover (e.g., Yellowstone National Park). Grasses and sedges form the mainstay of the annual diet in all regions. However, summer and fall diets may be broader, including flowering plants, woody plant leaves, and lichens, in addition to grasses and sedges, depending on local availability. Bison excavate snow at foraging sites by sweeping it away using side to side motions of their muzzle. The plains bison undertook seasonal migrations when they were abundant prior to European settlement of the continent. Bison no longer migrate owing to land use change contributing to range restriction and depopulation. The Wood Bison was not migratory and remains so. Both subspecies exhibit strong seasonal aggregation during the calving through breeding seasons (May through August).</p>","In the 19th Century, market, subsistence and recreational hunting nearly eliminated the bison throughout its range in North America. Conservation measures have brought about limited recovery in the wild and in captive conservation herds. Private commercial production of bison has resulted in significant numerical recovery, but does not provide for conservation of the bison as wildlife in the sense used for Red List designation. Existing threats include: habitat loss; genetic manipulation of commercial bison for market traits; small population effects in most conservation herds; few herds are exposed to a full range of natural limiting factors (natural selection); cattle gene introgression; loss of genetic non-exchangeability through hybridization between bison subspecies; and the threat of depopulation as a management response to infection of some wild populations hosting reportable cattle diseases. Canada, the United States and Mexico list bison nationally as both wildlife and domestic livestock. Legal status varies among State and Provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, four provinces and two territories classify bison as both wildlife and livestock. Bison are legally classified as livestock in the United Sates only 10 states classify bison as wildlife in all or portions of the state. An additional threat to populations of this species is culling to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.","There are approximately 31,000 total bison in 68 conservation herds (herds managed in the public interest by governments and environmental organizations) in North America. These include about 20,000 Plains Bison and 11,000 total Wood Bison. For this assessment we applied a rigorous set of criteria to classify herds as functioning as wild, functioning as wild with limitations and not functioning as wild. We excluded from this assessment 30 of 68 conservation bison herds that are very small (&lt;300) and managed on small landscapes (&lt;10,000 acres) for education, public viewing and research. Based on our criteria these bison cannot function as wild bison under current management schemes. We also did not include 9,523 bison in 18 herds managed behind fences and held in captivity, although these are important conservation herds. These herds are considered captive, intensively husbanded and culled by artificial selection.<br/><br/>There are 14,703 bison in eight herds that are in populations &gt;400 and function as wild bison subject to the full range of natural selections forces. Another 4,044 wild bison are found in 12 herds that free-range but suffer from small populations size (&lt;400) and may experience limited predation from large carnivores. For this assessment we considered the wild bison population to be 18,748 bison from these 20 free-ranging herds occupying large landscapes and primarily subjected to the forces of natural selection. We conducted Population Viability Analyses (PVA) for the eight largest herds to determine both the demographic and genetic viability of each population and their viability if they were managed as a meta-population out to 200 years (see the attached PVA report).<br/><br/>The number of calves and yearlings in a bison population will vary considerably between populations and years (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2008). Therefore It is difficult to establish the exact number of mature individuals in each of 20 bison herds but demographic data from many show that 30-40% are individuals under 2 years of age. We estimated that there are between 11,248 and 13,123 mature bison in the current populations of wild free-ranging bison in North America.<br/><br/>Populations are considered viable in the long term if they exceed 1,000 individuals (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are two Plains Bison conservation herds and two Wood Bison conservation herds each exceeding 1,000 individuals—therefore according to this criteria the total number of viable populations is only four. However, a specific population viability analysis was performed on the eight bison herds functioning as wild and results demonstrate that all are demographically viable but all but the two largest herds will lose 5-8% of their genetic diversity over the next 200 years (see the PVA report in the Supplementary Material).",Stable,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The original North American range <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">for <em>Bison bison</em> extended from northern Mexico to Alaska.

The species' current range is restricted by land use and wildlife management policies in the southern area and by wildlife and reportable disease management policies in the northern portion of the North American range.

National Refuges and Parks and State parks play an important role in maintaining conservation herds in Canada and the United States. Wild free-ranging herds are managed by government agencies. The Nature Conservancy manages 13 captive herds and the American Prairie Reserve manages one fenced bison herd primarily for conservation objectives. Restoration of large populations of plains bison are being considered in Alberta, southern Colorado, Arizona and northern Montana. The State of Alaska recently reintroduced wood bison to the wild in the Yukon region. Better coordination among various federal initiatives for plains bison conservation is being accomplished by a designated Department of Interior Bison Working Group commissioned by secretarial order in 2008. A Plains Bison reintroduction is scheduled for Banff National Park in spring 2017.<br/> <br/> The Bison Specialist Group (North America) produced a bison conservation assessment and action plan that provides support and guidance for policy development and conservation planning and management for public and private sector projects, including: numeric, geographic and genetic status of North American bison, including public and private herds; a review of legislation and policies of individual range states regarding bison conservation; geographic assessment of priority conservation areas in North America (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010); enhancing the capacity of members of the Bison Specialist Group and organizations they represent to provide timely, innovative and practical solutions to conservation challenges; guidelines for management in support of species’ conservation and ecological restoration. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are potential opportunities for ecological restoration of herds managed primarily for conservation on federal, state, provincial lands in some jurisdictions (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, Freese <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recently the U.S. Department of Interior published a document titled “looking forward” where they enumerated potential restoration sites in the United States (National Park Service 2014a).

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures.

They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).
