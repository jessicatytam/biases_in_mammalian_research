3338689,12375,Loris tardigradus,Endangered,C2a(i),2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, there is an observed continuing decline in the number of mature individuals, and no subpopulation contains more than 250 mature individuals.","<em>Loris tardigradus tardigradus</em> is found in wet lowland forests (Schulze and Meier 1995), tropical rain, swampy coastal and evergreen forests, and wet zone lowland forest up to 470 m (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003). <em>Loris t. tardigradus</em> has only been observed to eat animal prey. Although they will eat fruit in a captive setting, they will always choose animal prey first. In addition to insects (including moths, stick insects, dragonflies, beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers), they relish lizards and geckos. At Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve, lorises were found in high abundance in areas characterised by <em>Humboldtia laurifolia</em>, a tree that has a mutualistic relationship with ants, providing abundant food for lorises. Lorises occurred at densities of 0.08-0.55 animals/ha across 15 separate sites. Loris abundance was positively associated with vines and branches providing continuous passage, branches of small size (&lt;5 cm) and trees providing a number of potential sleeping sites. Vicinity to human populations negatively impacts this species; it is not found in home gardens, and seems to require continuous canopy to move between forest patches.<br/><em>Loris t. nycticeboides</em> may possibly be more carnivorous than the lowland subspecies. As is this case with other primates at high altitudes, it also may occur at lower densities. The forest where it occurs has been classified as cloud forest, montane forest and evergreen forest at altitudes greater than 1,500 m (Schulze and Meier 1995), from 1,650 to 2,000 m (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003). Of actual sightings, the highest was at 2,134 m and the lowest at 1,829 m altitude. Temperatures in its habitat have been recorded from 15.4°C (May/June) to -4°C (Dec/Jan) (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003; Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2005; Nekaris and Bearder 2006).","The threats imposed by humans on Sri Lankan <em>Loris</em> include habitat loss, road kill, and hunting for the pet trade, traditional “medicine,” and superstitious killing. Also, lorises have been electrocuted on un-insulated power lines. <em>Loris t. tardigradus</em> exists in few isolated forest patches that are also under severe encroachment by humans. Recent population studies estimate low numbers in forest patches and it is evident that both subspecies are in decline (Nekaris 2003, 2006).<br/><br/>Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for <em>L. t. nycticeboides</em>: “land and water pollution, habitat loss due to agriculture, dairy husbandry, and vegetable cultivation, as well as local and commercial trade for eyes and meat by tea plantation workers, and possible village level trade for folk medicine”. While for <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> major threats are: “deforestation due to urbanization, and local, domestic, and commercial trade for meat” (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003).","All populations are thought to be in decline. Population estimates suggest that there are approximately 1,500 animals of <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> in 3,000 ha of extremely fragmented forests, and about 80 animals in Horton Plains of <em>L. t. nycticeboides</em>. According to Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) the total population of <em>L. t.</em> nycticeboides is unknown, yet this species has declined by greater than 80% in the last 200 years and is predicted to decline by &gt;20% in the next 10 years. <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> is predicted to decline by greater than 10% in the next 5 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). These declines are based on the 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. The country has lost 97% of its forest cover (Mill 1995; Myers <em>et al</em>. 2000), thus dramatically reducing the population.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to central and south-western Sri Lanka, and is typically found in the southern “wet zone” of the island, up to the central “intermediate zone” (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004).<br/><br/><em>L. t. tardigradus</em> <br/>Found in south-western Sri Lanka, from Colombo (although no known population still exists in this city) in the north to Ranna on the south coast.

The eradication of local reliance on lorises for traditional “medicine” and use as superstitious scapegoats can only be achieved through education (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004). Reliable population estimates and a monitoring program are needed for all Sri Lankan loris populations.<br/>Molur <em>et al</em>.

The populations of this species are now extremely fragmented, and are increasingly restricted to karst areas which are under increasing threat due to cement mining.","In the north of its range this species is found in rainforest as well as deciduous forests and karst islands, while in the southern parts it tends to occur in mosaics of forest with some grasslands, probably due primarily to habitat availability. They occur below 2,000 m. It is diurnal and frugivorous, but will also consume leaves and arthropods. Females reach sexual maturity in 6-7 years, and inter-birth intervals averaged 32 months (Okamoto <em>et al.</em> 2000).","The major threat to moor macaques and other Sulawesi macaques seems to be habitat disturbance and fragmentation (Evans <em>et al.</em> 2001).

In Bolivia, it occurs east of the Río Mamoré, in the Departments of Beni and Santa Cruz (Brown and Rumiz 1986; Anderson 1997).<br/><br/>According to Hershkovitz (1977), in Brazil it occurs to the east of the Rio Madeira, from the mouth of the Rio Aripuanã extending south to beyond the Rio Guaporé and west to the Rio Roosevelt. However, field research and the discovery of a number of distinct new marmosets has modified the range he proposed. In the state of Rondônia evidence has not been forthcoming for its occurrence between the Rios Aripuanã and Roosevelt (the range of <em>M. intermedius</em>).

Hershkovitz’s (1977) proposal for its occurrence west of the Rio Aripuanã-Roosevelt was based on three localities. The first was the Foz do Rio Castanho (near the junction of the Rios Roosevelt, Guariba, and Aripuanã in the state of Amazonas) (locality 197b, p.569, Hershkovitz 1977).

Oryx disappeared from the north in the 1950s. In the south, their range steadily decreased due to hunting and by the 1960s oryx were restricted to parts of central and southern Oman.

According to a recent comprehensive range mapping exercise (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006), most tiger range is found in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (700,991 km², or 60% of tiger range).  The second most common habitat type is temperate and broadleaf mixed forest (251,516 km², or 21% of tiger range), and the third is tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests (122,599 km², or 10% of tiger range).  Other habitat types in which tigers are found include coniferous forest, mangrove forest, and tropical grass and shrubland.  Photos of tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the tiger's diet, and in general tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  Based on studies, Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimate that tigers need to kill 50 large prey animals per year.  Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines.  Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (water buffalo, gaur, banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  <br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges.  Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1-3 females, a typical felid pattern of social organization.  Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - eg, female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at 450 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  Similarly, reported tiger densities range from 11.65 adult tigers per 100 km² where prey is abundant (India's Nagarhole National Park) to as low as 0.13-0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).","Tiger range has contracted by 41% over the last decade (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  The sharpest decrease in area occurred in India, where landscapes with tigers were found to be much smaller and more fragmented than previously assessed in 1997.<br/><br/>While the reduction in range is due in some measure to improved knowledge of tiger distribution over the past decade, Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> (2007) consider habitat loss and poaching for trade to be primary causes of a significant decline in tiger range and numbers.  <br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable tiger populations.  Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of tiger habitat loss.  With their substantial dietary requirements, tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.  Karanth and Stith (1999) consider prey base depletion to be the leading threat to tigers in areas of otherwise suitable habitat.<br/><br/>In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the tiger to extinction (Nowell, 2000).  Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell, 2007).  Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu, 2007).  Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell, 2007).  In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching 5,000.  They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce tiger products, and several are already engaged in illegal production of tiger bone wine.  Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of tiger bone has decreased since China banned tiger bone in 1993.  Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu, 2007).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Shepherd and Magnus, 2004; Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure.  But many tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock.  Conflict-killed tigers can also feed into the illegal trade.  Many tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell, 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for tiger conservation.  In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, 41 people were killed by tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh during an 18-month period in 2001-2003 (Khan 2004).<br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al</em>. (2006) surveyed 77 biologists about threats to tigers in the areas they work in, and compiled the results to indicate threat prevalence across tiger range.

(2006: 14)","Scientific efforts to monitor tiger populations and estimate their size have increased in recent years (Gratwicke <em>et al</em>. 2006).  A collation of national tiger estimates is given below.  While some national populations can be estimated with confidence (notably Russia, India and Nepal), most are admittedly more speculative, ranging from application of site-specific density estimates over large areas to outright guesstimates.  Putting all these national estimates together, the global tiger population is estimated to range from 3,402-5,140.  <br/><br/>A previous compilation of national estimates to determine the global population estimated 5,000-7,000 tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 1999).  While most of these previous estimates were rough and lacked the scientific rigor that has gone into some recent estimates, so that a direct comparison is unreliable, a global population decline is suggested, as would be expected given the documented range reduction of 41% over the last decade (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In terms of conserving the wild tiger's genetic biodiversity, population biologists prefer to work with a number that approximates the actual breeding population, the number of animals which raise offspring to reproductive adulthood, or effective population size (Ne).  The number of breeding tigers in one population was equivalent to just 40% of the actual adult population, based on long-term demographic studies in Nepal's Chitwan National Park (Smith and McDougal, 1991).  Therefore, the tiger's effective population size could be in the range of 1,361-2,056 reproductively successful adults.<br/><br/>National tiger population estimates<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Tigers are now largely restricted to the Sundarbans mangrove forest.  Estimating tiger density based on prey density, Khan (2004) estimated the population at 200.  A higher estimate of 419 was obtained by the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests, which carried out a joint census with their Indian counterparts (MoEF 2004), using a methodology of identifying individual tigers from their tracks which has been criticized as yielding inaccurate results (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2003).  Based on the first data on home range collected from two radio-collared female tigers (11.5 and 13.9 km²), Barlow <em>et al.</em> (2007) roughly estimated there could be 95-286 female tigers in the Sundarbans.  Estimate used for global population:  200-419<br/><br/>Bhutan:  Dorji and Santiapillaai (1989) estimated Bhutan's tiger population at 151 (based on track counts) to 250 (extrapolating to unsurveyed areas).  However, the density they used for their extrapolation (1 adult per 40 km²) was high for the more high-altitude parts of their range.  In Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (where tigers have been recorded up to 4,500 m), Wang (2008) estimates, from camera trapping, a density of one tiger per 200 km².  A similar density for the central Himalayan region was obtained from track surveys by McDougal and Tsering in the late 1990s, 1 tiger/185 km².  Overall, their surveys estimated 67-81 adult tigers in Bhutan; this figure is used in the Govt of Bhutan's 2005 National Tiger Action Plan (Sangay and Wangchuk, 2005), although further research is necessary to clarify tiger abundance and distribution in the country (S. Wang pers. comm. 2008).  Estimate used for global population: 67-81<br/><br/>Cambodia:  Several NGOs working on tiger conservation held a meeting in 2004 to review data for the Tiger Conservation Landscape delineation exercise (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  Based on their work, using a range of methodologies including camera traps and field surveys by biologists and community wildlife rangers, Cambodia's tiger population was estimated at 11-50 tigers (Chheang <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <br/><br/>China:  The Govt of China, State Forest Administration, distributed a presentation at the 2007 International Tiger Symposium held April 2007 in Kathmandu, Nepal.  The total tiger population in China was estimated at 37-50, broken down as follows.  Amur tiger <em>P.t. altaica</em> (northeastern China) 18-22; Bengal tiger P.t. tigris (Motuo county, Tibet) 8-12; Indochinese tiger <em>P.t. corbetti</em> (southern Yunnan province) 11-16; South China tiger <em>P.t. amoyensis</em> (southern China) no definite evidence of continued persistence (Govt of China 2007, GTF 2007).  <br/><br/>India:  India's previous national tiger censuses were based on recognition of individual tiger tracks, and in 2001-2002 estimated the population at 3,642 tigers.  This methodology was criticized by leading tiger scientists for being inaccurate and inefficient (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2003).  A new methodology has been developed as recommended by the 2005 tiger action plan (Govt of India 2005), using GIS mapping systems to extrapolate tiger densities derived from camera trap and sign-based indices of abundance.  The Indian tiger population is now estimated at 1,411 (range 1,165-1,657 (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2008).  The Indian Sundarbans tiger population was not estimated.  Because of the difference in methodology, it is not clear how much of the reduction from the 2001 estimate is due to actual loss of tigers as opposed to a more accurate census result. <br/><br/>Indonesia:  The Sumatran tiger occurs in about 58,321 km² of forested habitat in 12 potentially isolated Tiger Conservation Landscapes totalling 88,351 km² (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006), with about 37,000 km² protected in ten national parks (Govt of Indonesia 2007b).  The tiger population was estimated at 400-500 in the first and second national tiger action plans (Govt of Indonesia 1994, 2007a), and at 342-509 in six major protected areas (estimates from Shepherd and Magnus 2004).  However, incorporating more recent research (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2006, Govt. of Indonesia 2007b), covering most of tiger estimated habitat (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006), suggests the population could be 441-679 (see Red List assessment of <em>Panthera tigris sumatrae</em> for details).  Understanding of Sumatran tiger status will improve when research in the three Tiger Conservation Landscapes in Riau province by Sunarto <em>et al.</em> (2007) is complete.  Estimate used for global population: 441-679<br/><br/>Lao PDR:  No population estimates are available, and Lao PDR is not included in the global population estimate.  Tigers are known to occur in five (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999) to seven areas (GTF 2007).  One of the largest is the 3,446 km² (+ 854 km² proposed extension) Nam Et - Phou Louey National Protected Area.  Based on camera trapping, tiger density there was estimated at 0.2-0.7 per 100 km², a relatively low density suggesting a population of only 7-23 tigers in the reserve (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2006).  Tigers and their large ungulate prey have have been depleted by hunting pressure across the country, and tiger numbers are likely to be low (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999).  <br/><br/>Malaysia:  Based on typical prey biomass in tropical rainforests, energetic needs of tigers, estimated tiger densities from studies carried out in Taman Negara National Park, Malaysia, and others in tropical Asia, and available tiger habitats in Peninsular Malaysia, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the national tiger population at 493-1,480 adult tigers.  The lower bound coincides with the previous population estimate for the country (Topani 1990) and is the number selected as feasible by the country's national tiger action plan (DWNP 2008).  However, based on density estimates derived from camera trapping in six sites in Malaysia during the late 1990s, Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) suggest a lower  population, ""up to several hundred."" Estimate range used for global population: 300-493<br/><br/>Myanmar: The national tiger population was estimated at approximately 150, according to extensive surveys covering much of the country (Lynam 2003).  Most tigers (approximately 100) are found in the large Hukaung Tiger reserve in the north of the country (Lynam <em>et al.</em> in prep.).  Tigers have lost much of their historical range in Myanmar, and where they persist are at very low densities.  The other important area for tigers is the forest complex found in northern and southern Taninthayi Division (approx. 50) (Lynam 2003).  <br/><br/>Nepal:  According to government representatives attending the 2007 International Tiger Symposium of the Global Tiger Forum, a 2006 exercise, based in part on camera trapping, estimated 350-370 tigers.  The same number was obtained in 2005 and also in 1999-2000, and the population is considered stable (GTF 2007). <br/><br/>North Korea:  There have been no surveys since 1998, when tiger tracks were reported along the border with China (Miquelle 1998).<br/><br/>Russia:  In 2005 a comprehensive winter snow tracking census estimated 331-393 adult/sub-adult tigers.  977 fieldworkers covered 1537 transect routes totalling 26,031 km.  Using a similar methodology, 330-371 adult tigers were estimated in 1996.  The more recent number probably reflects more intensive survey effort (Miquelle <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/>Thailand: Tigers occur in 15 spatially disjunct forest complexes in Thailand (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1999), and were recorded in six out of seven forest complexes where camera trap surveys were carried out (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006).  The best area for tigers is Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, with an estimated 113 tigers (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2007).  Extrapolating the density obtained from Huai Kha Khaeng (3.98 tigers per 100 km²) to the large 18,000 km² Western Forest complex, the largest habitat block for tigers in Thailand,  Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> (2007) estimated it could hold 720 tigers, with the potential to harbor 2,000 if prey densities were to increase.  However, this estimate should be treated as speculative pending further data from other parts of the Western Forest complex, where conditions are unlikely to be as good as in Huai Kha Khaeng.  For example, the distribution map in Thailand's national tiger action plan portrays appoximately half of the Western Forest complex population as low density in comparison to the Huai Kha Khaeng population (Tunhikorn <em>et al.</em> 2004).  In other Thai forest complexes, including Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2001) and the Dong Phayayen-Khai Yai complex (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006), tigers were few, occurring at much lower densities than would have been predicted on the basis of habitat quality.  Rabinowitz (1993), using presence/absence surveys and a modified arbitrary density estimate of 1 tiger per 100 km², estimated the Thai tiger population at no more than 250.  Estimate range used for global population: 250-720.<br/><br/>Viet Nam:  According to government representatives attending the 2007 International Tiger Symposium of the Global Tiger Forum, a 2004-2005 exercise estimated not more than 100 tigers in areas along the borders with Lao and Cambodia (GTF 2007).",,"The tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).  Over the past 100 years tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia.  Tigers have lost 93% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  <br/><br/>Tigers are currently found in twelve Asian range states:  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Viet Nam.  They may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence. <br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006) undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map current tiger range.  Priority areas for tigers were delineated and are called Tiger Conservation Landscapes, or TCLs.  TCLs are defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five tigers, and tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade.  The range map shows the TCLs, and maps can be viewed in detail at the Save the Tiger Fund website: http://www.savethetigerfund.org/am/customsource/tiger/mapping/index.cfm<br/><br/>A total of 76 TCLs were delineated, with a total area of 1,184,911 km².  TCLS vary in size, with the largest 269,983 km² in the Russian Far East and the smallest 278 km² in India.  Most TCLs are small: 61 (80%) are less than 10,000 km² in area, and the median area for the entire set is just 2,904 km².  Rabinowitz (1999) and Karanth and Nichols (2002) emphasize the importance of large core zones (&gt;3,000 km²) with a healthy prey base for conservation of viable tiger populations.<br/><br/>However, tiger range is actually smaller than the total area of TCLS, because most TCLS contain area of non-tiger habitat where tigers cannot live (average 55% non-habitat, ranging from 20-70% of a TCL).  The average amount of legally protected area within a TCL is shown below.<br/><br/>However, tigers do occur outside the TCLs.  The exercise also identified 543 Fragments with Tigers - areas of habitat with confirmed tiger presence, but considered too small to support a long-term population.  Also, 491 Tiger Survey Landscapes were highlighted - areas where tiger status is unknown, but where there is some reason to believe tigers might still be present, and which are large enough to support at least five tigers.<br/><br/>The Indian sub-continent (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Bhutan, western Myanmar) is the bioregion with the most TCLS (40) and the highest number of TCLs assessed as being of global importance and of top priority for conservation (11).  Total TCL area 227,569 km².  Median TCL size 2,154 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 15.8%.<br/><br/>The Indochina bioregion (Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam) has a smaller number of TCLs (20, with 6 of top priority) but the largest TCL total area of the four bioregions.  Total TCL area 540,758 km².  Median TCL size 5,288 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 29.2%.<br/><br/>The Southeast Asia bioregion supports 15 TCLs, with 3 of global priority.  Total TCL area 145,285 km².  Median TCL size 3,884 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 36.5%.<br/><br/>The Russian Far East bioregion (which includes small areas of northeastern China and North Korea) has just two TCLs, but includes the world's largest (269,983 km²).  Total TCL area 271,297 km².  Median TCL size 135,649 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 9.9%.<br/><br/>Tiger range has been shrinking not only historically, but also more recently.  Comparison of current TCL area with a previous estimate a decade ago (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997) finds that tiger range has shrunk by 41% in the past ten years.  This discrepancy is due in part to technical reasons including a better state of knowledge and improved tiger detection methodologies (Karanth <em>et al</em>., 2003, Sanderson <em>et al</em>., 2006).  However, Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> (2007) consider tiger poaching and habitat loss to be important causes of this recent decline. <br/><br/>Although tiger range loss has been serious and steep, Sanderson <em>et al</em>. (2006) still consider 77% of current range to consist of ""known and secured breeding populations of tigers in areas large enough for a substantive population.""  Roughly half of all TCLs are big enough to support an estimated 100 tigers or more, with the largest seven TCLs offering the potential to support 500 or more tigers.  Even if tiger populations in these landscapes are below carrying capacity, these areas provide opportunities to increase tiger populations with appropriate conservation measures (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2006).",,Terrestrial,"Tigers have been the focus of substantial conservation effort and investment.  Most range countries have developed or are developing national tiger conservation action plans (see Country Action Plan section of the Save the Tiger Fund website), and have called for IUCN to facilitate an international tiger conservation strategy (Nowell <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  A unique international conservation body, the Global Tiger Forum, brings together tiger range state governments with other governments and NGO members (GTF, 2007).<br/><br/>Tigers are included on CITES Appendix I, banning international trade, and all tiger range states as well as countries with consumer markets have banned domestic trade as well (although implementation has been uneven, and some legal loopholes remain (Nowell, 2007).  At the 14th Conference of the Parties to CITES, stronger enforcement measures were called for, as well as an end to tiger farming (the production of tiger products from captive tigers) (Nowell <em>et al.</em>, 2007).<br/><br/>National governments have invested huge resources in tiger conservation, including India, which has had a special Project Tiger program since the early 1970s.  Increasingly, international inter-governmental organizations such as the World Bank are also supporting tiger conservation.  Nongovernmental organizations have been very active.  S. Christie (in Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006) analyzed tiger conservation funding by non-governmental organizations in the years 1998-2002.  Over $23 million USD was invested, primarily in India, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nepal.  The Save the Tiger Fund, funded in part by ExxonMobil, has invested 12.6 million USD in tiger conservation from 1995-2004 (Gratwicke <em>et al.</em>, 2006).<br/><br/>To address the threat posed by habitat loss and fragmentation of the tiger population, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Panthera Foundation announced plans on January 30 2008 to establish a 5,000 mile-long ""genetic corridor"" from Bhutan to Myanmar that would conserve a large contiguous tiger population.  It would span eight countries and represent the largest block of tiger habitat left on earth.  The proposed corridor includes extensive areas of Bhutan, northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, along with potential connectivity to Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. It was endorsed by the King of Bhutan, his Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who requested other heads of state to support similar efforts.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006) surveyed 77 biologists about the effectivess of conservation measures for tigers in the areas they work in (Tiger Conservation Landscapes), and compiled the results to indicate conservation effectiveness across tiger range.  Scores for 22 conservation measures are given below; high scores indicate high effectiveness and widespread implemenation.

8525654,18740,Pteropus melanotus,Vulnerable,A2cde,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Vulnerable as the species is thought likely to undergo a decline of more than 30% over the next three generations due to the impacts of habitat loss, hunting and possibly introduced predators. If the Christmas Island population was found to be specifically distinct, it would be assessed as Critically Endangered given that its population declined by 83% in 3 generations, and the causes of the decline are not known and may not have ceased.","In South Asia, this species roosts in large colonies consisting of several thousands of individuals in the mangrove vegetation (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2002). Feeds on both wild and cultivated fruit. A single young is born (Bates and Harrison 1997). It has been observed to feed on <em>Bombax</em> spp. and Sterculia spp. (Aul and Vijaykumar 2003). On Christmas Island part of the population roosts in large camps at traditional locations and part roosts scattered singly and in small groups through the forest. It was recorded roosting in 11 tree species in December 2005-Feb 2006 (Orchard 2006). Camps are always near the coast (D. J. James pers. comm.). Numbers in camps fluctuate widely, possibly in response to winds that facilitate emergence (D. J. James pers. comm.). They feed on a number of rainforest fruits and flowers; of 26 known species in the diet, 10 are introduced species and at least five of these 10 seem to be very important (Orchard 2006). It is relatively diurnal, emerging from camps well before dusk. Non-flying young have been recorded in December and January (Orchard 2006; D. J. James pers. comm.).","In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this species is threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from logging operations and the conversion of land to agricultural purposes. It is also threatened due to tourism related developmental activities (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002), and from overhunting at daytime roosts, as the bones are crushed and used as asthma medicine (L. Lumsden pers. comm.). These bats are kept as pets on Car Nicobar, Kamorta, Katchal, Pulo Milo and Trinket Islands. The December 2004 tsunami is likely to have damaged the mangrove habitat of this species, however, further research is needed to confirm that the species has declined because of this event. The population on the Indonesian island of Enggano may have been wiped out by a hurricane, although this needs to be confirmed, and while threats to the species on Nias are not known, they presumably include general habitat loss. It is preyed on by feral cats on Christmas Island, and there has also been some hunting, including large numbers (up to 200), in the past, however, there is no recent evidence of hunting in this part of the species range (D. J. James pers. comm.). Corbett <em>et al.</em> (2003) hypothesised that a severe cyclone in 1988 initiated the decline in the Christmas Island population. However, other anecdotal evidence indicates that the decline began in the mid 1990s (Orchard 2006). The Yellow Crazy Ant <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em> has caused general ecological breakdown on Christmas Island since the late 1990s (O'Dowd <em>et al.</em> 2003). Disease (speculative) may be a factor. Threats to the Christmas Island population have proven difficult to identify, and are likely to be a combination of factors (Orchard 2006). James <em>et al.</em> (2007), provide a detailed account of possible threats to the species including, predation or disturbance by both, or either, introduced and native species; predation and/or persecution by humans (mostly formerly); loss of habitat; storm events; accidental poisoning; light pollution; and disease and parasites. James <em>et al</em>. (2007), also give a 'threat assessment matrix' indicating the likelihood of each potential threat.","Aul and Vijaykumar (2003) report a colony of more than 300 individuals in a mangrove creek on Great Nicobar Island. Aul and Vijaykumar (2003) also counted more than 500 individuals in the mangroves and under Nypa palms on Tillangchong Island in the Nicobars; 10-15 individuals have been recorded from palm fronds on Tillangchong Island, with several pups in this colony in the month of March. There appears to be no information on the current status of the population in the Mentawi Islands. On Christmas Island in 1984 the population was estimated to contain 3,500 individuals in five main camps and a further 2,500 individuals scattered singly or in small groups (Tidemann 1985). The camps were thought to have been historical, dating to before human settlement. By 1989 one more camp had been located, bringing the total to six camps, but only containing a hundred or so extra animals (Tidemann <em>et al</em>. 1993). Duncan <em>et al</em>. (1999) interpreted Tidemann's population figures as ""less than 10,000 animals"". In 1997-1998, few camps could be found and these contained few individuals (P. Meek, via L. Lumsden pers. comm.). In August 2002 only 17 Individuals were recorded during 26 field days of a general fauna survey, and the population was loosely estimated to be in the order of 500 to 1,000 individuals (Corbett <em>et al. </em>2003). In April 2004 only one of the original five known camps could be found, and in November 2004 that camp contained 299 individuals (D. J. James pers. comm.). In December 2005, two of the six colonies once known were active but extensive searches for additional colonies were not successful. Counts in these two colonies from January to March 2006 varied between 14 and 500 individuals, apparently in response to local wind conditions. The number of bats roosting away from camps has not been estimated accurately, but is likely to be less than the number in camps; nocturnal surveys reveal wide distribution of foraging animals. The entire population was unlikely to number more than 1,000 individuals in March 2006 (Orchard 2006; D. J. James pers. comm.). In September 2006, there was a count of 1,381 individuals on Christmas Island (James <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Decreasing,"This species is limited to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India (Bompuka, Car Nicobar, Great Nicobar (including Campbell Bay), Kamorta, Katchal, Kondul, Nancowrie, South Sentinel, Tilangchong, Tressa and Trinket Islands [<em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus</em>] and South Andaman and Rutlans Islands [<em>Pteropus melanotus tytleri</em>]) (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002), the Mentawi Islands (Nias and Enggano [<em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii</em>]) of Indonesia, and Christmas Island of Australia (<em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em>).

The species does not occur in any official protected areas.,"Tropical dry forest, tropical humid forest, and very humid premontane forest (Defler 2004). Present in both primary and secondary forests, in gallery forest, and in some urban areas (Poveda <em>et al</em>. 2001; Poveda and Sanchez-Palomino 2004).  <br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentitions of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus</em> and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) do not provide for gouging, and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8.

However, the introduction of <em>Scuirus carolinensis</em> and <em>Calosciurus finleysonii</em> to Italy is a concern. The red squirrel populations here need to be closely monitored and action taken quickly if populations show continued declines or introduced species are shown to widen their ranges.","It is most abundant in large tracts of coniferous forest and also occurs in deciduous woods, mixed forest, parks, gardens, and small stands of conifers. It is found in lowland to subalpine forests. Its diet is mainly vegetarian, consisting of seeds, acorns, fungus, bark, and sapwood, although it occasionally takes animal prey (young birds and eggs). They are an important species for the reforestation process.","The main threats to this species are habitat loss and fragmentation, but these are not considered to pose a major threat to the species at present.<br/><br/>In Britain and Italy, out-competition by the introduced grey squirrel <em>Sciurus carolinensis</em> (Gurnell and Pepper 1993, Wauters <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bertolino and Genovesi 2003). Now that the grey squirrel has become established on the continent, it can be expected that it may ultimately spread throughout much of the red squirrel's range. Grey squirrels not only out-compete the smaller red squirrels, but also carry parapox virus, which is highly pathogenic to red squirrels. Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected, and recent (2006) UK studies have shown that 61% of apparently healthy grey squirrels have been exposed to the virus and may be carriers (C. McInnes <em>in litt.</em> 2006). When the virus is present, the grey squirrel can replace the red squirrel 20 times faster than normal replacement rate (Rushton <em>et al.</em> 2006). The virus has not yet been recorded in Italy.<br/><br/>In Japan, this species is frequently sold as pets, having been imported from the mainland, and so the risk of the spread of this species across Japan is high, with much resulting concern for its impact on the native <em>Sciurus lis</em>.<br/><br/>In Mongolia, unsustainable hunting for skins, for the international fur trade is a threat. Records of hunting levels between 1942 and 1960 are available in Stubbe (1965), although current hunting levels have not been established.","Although it is described as common throughout most of its range (Gurnell and Wauters 1999), there have been well-documented population declines and range contractions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy (Gurnell and Pepper 1993, Wauters <em>et al.</em> 1997, O'Teangana <em>et al.</em> 2000). Typical densities range from less than 0.1 to 1.5 individuals per hectare (Gurnell and Wauters 1999). However, it is sufficiently common in some parts of its range that it is considered a forestry pest owing to its habit of stripping bark and feeding on conifer buds.<br/><br/>In Mongolia the population is subject to great fluctuations, which are reflected in the fur-trade statistics. From 1958-1960 an average of over 145,000 skins/year was obtained; in 1961, 70,300 skins were obtained and in 1962, 33,135 skins were harvested.

The problem is not trivial, since at least 17 potentially new taxa have been discovered within the population of tarsiers that Niemitz (1984) classified as a single subspecies. This is particularly true since, owing to the conservation threats to some of the smaller populations with restricted ranges, there is the possibility that they may go extinct before they have even been named. This is turn argues in favor of the most conservative conservation estimate that can be justified for <em>T. tarsier.</em>","<em>Tarsius tarsier sensu stricto</em> has not been the subject of systematic study, but by analogy with wild tarsier populations studied at Tangkoko and with <em>T. dentatus</em> at Lore Lindu National Park, it is expected that this taxon is found in primary, secondary and mangrove forests, forest gardens, and a variety of other habitats of varying degrees of human disturbance that provide adequate shrubby cover. It shows extreme adaptations for vertical clinging and leaping (VCL) in the understory of suitable tropical habitats, often 2 meters or less from the ground. Nocturnal social primates, they likely live in small, monogamous or polygamous groupings of 2-6. The home range is believed to be less than one hectare. Its diet is 100% live animal prey, mostly insects with some small vertebrates.","Major threats include habitat loss due to agriculture, illegal logging, mining of limestone for cement manufacture, agricultural pesticides, and predation by domestic animals (dogs and cats). Some animals are entering the pet trade (particularly from North Sulawesi, around Tankoko). Although there has been extensive loss of habitat, this species, however, has demonstrated some tolerance to forest conversion. Although seemingly among the least threatened of tarsiers owing to its relatively wide distribution, the possible existence of undescribed cryptic species makes it likely that some populations are more threatened than others. This species should be reassessed upon further taxonomic revision.","Within <em>T. tarsier, sensu lato</em>, the best studied population comes from Tangkoko, which is at the extreme northeast peninsula of Sulawesi, whereas Makassar, the type locality of <em>T. tarsier sensu stricto</em>, is at the extreme southwestern peninsula, and has not been the subject of systematic study. Population density estimates at Tangkoko are 70/km<sup>2</sup> (MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980) and 156/km<sup>2</sup> (Gursky 1997). Merker (2003) estimated population densities for <em>T. dentatus</em> in a variety of pristine and human disturbed habitats near Kamarora, on the edge of Lore Lindu National Park. The values he calculated were 270/km<sup>2</sup> in pristine habitat, 190/km<sup>2</sup> for slightly disturbed, 130/km<sup>2</sup> for moderate disturbance, and 45/km<sup>2</sup> in heavily disturbed habitat.",Decreasing,"By definition, <em>T. tarsier</em> is the rump taxon of tarsiers that remain in the Sulawesi biogeographic region, after excluding <em>T. sangirensis</em>, <em>T. pumilus</em>, <em>T. dentatus</em>, <em>T. pelengensis</em>, and <em>T. lariang</em>. This leaves <em>T. tarsier, sensu lato</em>, with an unlikely distribution that includes Sulawesi, Buton, Muna, Kabaena, Selayar, and the Togian Islands, below 1,800 m (with an actual vertical distribution that likely stops somewhere between 1,100-1,500 m), except those portions of Sulawesi that lie within the ranges of <em>T. dentatus</em> and <em>T. lariang</em>. As discussed by Brandon-Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004), this is distribution is improbably disjunct.  It is more likely that this population is subdivided into numerous insular and parapatric species, as hypothesized by Shekelle and Leksono (2004) and Brandon-Jones <em>et al.</em> (2004).",,Terrestrial,"Tarsiers are protected by international treaties, including CITES Appendix II, as well as by national law. Many portions of the range of this taxon are within conservation areas, but there needs to be improved management of these areas to ensure the continued survival of the species. Public education to overcome the misconception that tarsiers are crop pests would be a step forward in improving conservation measures. Indeed, the species might actually be beneficial to crops, as they eat, and may even have a dietary preference for, some of the real crop pests such as large grasshoppers.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

It is found at lower densities in edge habitats and secondary growth with many pole-sized trees and low-stature vegetation, as well as in gardens and other degraded habitats including agricultural areas and plantations. It feeds on small lizards, frogs, and insects.","There are several contributing factors that make this species susceptible to extinction (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2003): infant mortality rates, both in the wild and in captivity, are very high; highly specialized diet; relatively limited geographical range; high population density and extensive habitat destruction. Although it is clearly adaptable to anthropogenic habitats that contain bushes or trees, it occurs at higher densities in less disturbed habitats, especially in primary forest (very little of which remains within its range) (I. Arboleda pers. comm.). It is also heavily harvested as food and especially for the pet trade.

This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea-level in the south to above 3,000 m in the north (Wangchuk <em>et al.</em> 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).","Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al. </em>2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and woodcutting have severely affected these forest reserves (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.<br/>Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).","There is an estimated population of less than 1,500 individuals in India and around 4,000 individuals in Bhutan, with less than 2,500 mature individuals globally (J. Das pers. comm.). Demographic trends indicate a decline in the population of this species (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001). 93% of the population is found in contiguous forest, while the remaining 7% is found in several small isolated reserves (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). Contrary to predictions, groups were bigger and densities higher in areas of more degraded habitat (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future due to various threats outlined by field biologists in both India and Bhutan (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003).",Decreasing,"This species occurs only in Bhutan and north-eastern India (Assam). It is confined to a forest belt in western Assam between the Manas River in the east, Sankosh in the west and Brahmaputra in the south along the Indo-Bhutan border (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Its distribution in Bhutan is limited to the foothills of the Black Mountains (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001). The total known range of this species in both India and Bhutan is less than 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>, and much of it is not suitable habitat (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001).

However, Srivastava <em>et al</em>. (2001) reports that the species is also found in Ripu, Chirrang, and Manas Forest Reserves. Yet these reserves are unstable, and the complete protection of Manas National Park is needed (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). By upgrading the protection and status of this species, it is believed that isolated populations can be linked through corridors that will prevent genetic fragmentation (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). A long-term study is needed to assess the actual impact of habitat alteration on the species over long periods of time (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004).

In the Mediterranean and Black seas there have been substantial population declines; the Mediterranean population was recently assessed as Vulnerable (A2cde), and the Black Sea subspecies <em>T. t. ponticus</em> was classed as Endangered (A2cde)(Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). However, although there are no estimates of population size or trend from offshore waters of the North Atlantic, the population there is likely to be large and shows no evidence of significant decline. Overall in the European Mammal Assessment region, it is not possible to quantify the population trend because the relative size of the different subpopulations is not known. Consequently the species is assessed as Data Deficient at the European regional level.","Common bottlenose dolphins tend to be primarily coastal, but they can also be found in pelagic waters (Wells and Scott 1999). Where distinct ecotypes are known, the inshore form frequents estuaries, bays, lagoons and other shallow coastal regions, occasionally ranging far up into rivers. The offshore form is apparently less restricted in range and movement. Some offshore dolphins are residents around oceanic islands. In many inshore areas bottlenose dolphins maintain definable, long-term multi-generational home ranges, but in some locations near the extremes of the species range, coastal bottlenose dolphins are migratory. Black Sea bottlenose dolphins are common over the continental shelf; they sometimes occur far offshore (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). <br/><br/>Bottlenose dolphins are commonly associated with many other cetaceans, including both large whales and other dolphin species (Wells and Scott 1999).  Mixed schools with Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins have been found, for instance off China and Taiwan (J. Wang, pers. comm.).  Spring and summer, spring and fall, or single summer calving peaks are known for most areas where this has been studied (Wilson 1995, Wells and Scott 1999). In general, bottlenose dolphins consume a wide variety of prey species, mostly fish  and squid (Barros and Odell 1990, Barros and Wells 1998, Santos <em>et al.</em> 2001).  They sometimes eat shrimps and other crustaceans.","Coastal and island-centered populations are especially vulnerable to hunting, incidental catch, and habitat degradation (see Curry and Smith 1997 for a review). Acute conservation problems are known in the Mediterranean and Black seas (IWC 1992, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006) as well as a number of other areas in the global range (outside Europe). Dolphin catches for bait, human consumption, or to remove competition with fisheries have been reported worldwide (see reviews in Wells and Scott 1999, 2002).  <br/><br/>The only Mediterranean area with quantitative historical information is the northern Adriatic Sea, where bottlenose dolphins likely have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, largely as a consequence of historical killing in extermination campaigns to reduce competition for fish, followed by habitat degradation and overfishing. The extermination campaigns were conducted until the early 1960s (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2004, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).  For the north-western Mediterranean, the available information suggests similar trends (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). <br/><br/>Drive fisheries have been reported from the Faroe Islands and Japan. Up to 308 are taken annually in the Faroe Islands drive fishery (dating back to 1803), often with long finned pilot whales (Reyes 1991). The Black Sea subspecies has had extensive directed takes for commercial products (Kleinenberg 1956, Tomilin 1957, Buckland <em>et al.</em> 1992), including takes of at least 24,000-28,000 during 1946-1983 in the Black Sea off Turkey.  However, the total number of dolphins killed was certainly much greater (probably by tens of thousands) as figures do not include, or only partially include, catch statistics from other Black Sea countries (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>Live-capture removal of Black Sea bottlenose dolphins, including mortality during capture operations, is estimated at 1,000-2,000 since the early 1960s. Live-captures continue in the Russian Federation, with 10-20 animals taken annually from a small area in the Kerch Strait, Russia (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). According to CITES statistics, at least 92 individuals were removed from the Black Sea region during 1990-1999 (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003) and Russia reportedly has exported at least 66 for travelling shows since 1997 (Fisher and Reeves 2005).<br/><br/>Incidental catches of common bottlenose dolphins are known from throughout the species’ range, in gillnets, driftnets, purse seines, trawls, long-lines, and on hook-and-line gear used in commercial and recreational fisheries, but numbers of mortalities are often poorly documented (Wells and Scott 1999). Annual Black Sea bottlenose dolphin incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets from 1946 through the 1980s is roughly estimated in the hundreds. The scale of this mortality almost certainly increased in the 1990s-2000s owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). According to Öztürk (1999) at least 200-300 bottlenose dolphins per year may be taken incidentally in Turkish fisheries in a variety of fishing nets, especially bottom-set gill nets.<br/><br/>Common bottlenose dolphins in coastal areas are exposed to a wide variety of threats in addition to direct and indirect takes. Threats that are cause for concern include: 1) the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals; 2) reduced prey availability caused by environmental degradation and overfishing (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 1998, Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2001); 3) direct and indirect disturbance and harassment (e.g. boat traffic and commercial dolphin watching and interactive programs); 4) marine construction and demolition and 5) other forms of habitat destruction and degradation (including anthropogenic noise). Although these and other threats are technically challenging to quantify by comparison with takes, their cumulative impact is likely to result in longitudinal population declines. Lack of historical data in many cases hampers understanding of long term trends, possibly resulting in shifting baselines. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to an increasing number of Unusual Mortality Events involving bottlenose dolphins remains to be determined (Spradlin <em>et al.</em> 2005).","Abundance has been estimated for several parts of the species' range. Summing available estimates, a minimum world-wide estimate of common bottlenose dolphins is 600,000. <br/><br/>Total abundance in the Mediterranean is unknown but thought to be in the low 10,000s based on observed densities in areas that have been surveyed (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Surveys in the northwestern Mediterranean estimated 7,654 (CV=45%) dolphins (Forcada <em>et al.</em> 2004).  An estimated 584 (CV=28%) animals occur in the Alboran Sea (Cañadas and Hammond 2006). Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins exhibit population structure based on toxicology and diet (Borrell <em>et al.</em> 2005) and genetics (Natoli et al. 2005). <br/><br/>The total population size in the Black Sea is unknown. However, there are recent abundance estimates for parts of the range suggesting that population size is at least several thousands (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). <br/><br/>Preliminary estimates from the late 1980s indicate about 1,000 dolphins occur around the Faroe Islands (Sigurjónsson <em>et al.</em> 1989, Bloch and Mikkelsen 2000). A wide scale survey in 2005 of western European continental shelf waters including the western Baltic, North Sea and Atlantic margin as far as southern Spain estimated that there were 12,600 bottlenose dolphins in this area (CV=27%, P. Hammond pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara (2006) estimate generation time in the common bottlenose dolphin to be c.20 years.",Decreasing,"Common bottlenose dolphins are distributed worldwide through tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1990, Wells and Scott 1999, Reynolds <em>et al.</em> 2000).

The species is rare in the Baltic Sea (it may best be considered extralimital there), and is vagrant to  Norway (Wells and Scott 1999).",,Marine,"The bottlenose dolphin has been afforded special protected status under Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive.  Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans including bottlenose dolphins was banned in 1966 in the former USSR, Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey.

The region is characterized by rapid rates of deforestation (estimates vary from 40,000 to 100,000 ha per year) and fragmentation, and has lost at least 40% of its forest cover, mainly from the low-altitude river basins (the preferred habitat of this species) over the last 20 years (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006). The construction of a two-lane all-weather road, which was asphalted in 2003 - La Carretera Marginal, Via Marginal, or Carretera Fernando Belaunde Terry - which runs all the way to the coast (Chiclayo) and past Tarapoto has contributed to the influx of immigrants and a change from subsistence to small-scale farming. It has also altered the spatial distribution of human settlers, who now follow the highway far into the valley and high forests, and the lack planning or state-regulated land occupation and use puts protected areas and remaining forests at risk (DeLuycker 2006).<br/> <br/> The species is not found in any large protected areas of San Martin. Recent studies (Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) determined that an estimated 60% of the species original range has already been lost, and its current range comprises only small fragments of secondary forest. All groups encountered live in small highly degraded remnants of forest, isolated from other populations. The species is being hunted for its meat, both the Aguarunas and recent immigrants hunt this species (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). While Titis Monkeys may not be a particularly lucrative source of protein, hunting pressure is likely to increase as preferred game become scarce and fragmentation facilitates access. These Titi Monkeys are popular as pets (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) and have been found for sale at markets (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003) and encountered along with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aotus miconax</span> at tourist centres in the upper Mayo valley (Mark 2003).</p>","<p>A few short surveys were undertaken (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006) and interviews conducted with communities of Aguaruna Amerindians to confirm the presence or absence of the species in different parts of its range.</p>  <p>Aldrich (2006) undertook a song-based survey of a population at Tarangue (a 74 ha private reserve near Moyobamba) and estimated a population density of 1.4 individuals per ha. Group sizes were unusually large for Titi Monkeys, with 20% of groups containing six to eight individuals. Rowe and Martinez (2003) carried out a four-day survey, and although they did not observe the species in the wild, they heard several groups of Titi Monkeys (presumed to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. oenanthe</span>) vocalizing in a forest remnant at 925 m. They photographed a family being sold at a local market that had been captured near Rioja. Mark (2003) carried out surveys at five sites and observed monkeys in fragments as small as 2 ha (804 m asl).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Until 2007, this species was thought to be endemic to the upper Rio Mayo valley or Alto Mayo (Hershkovitz 1990). However, a recent study by Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, undertaken over six months at 96 localities, revealed that its distribution extends much further to the south of the Department of San Martin, extending into the Bajo Mayo and Huallaga Central, almost reaching the Rio Huallabamba (known locally as the rio Huayabamba). This area is heavily deforested, and to date only one area was found where a viable population might live, although further research is needed to confirm this.</p>    <p>Mark (2003) and DeLuycker (2006) suggested that the species’ altitudinal range may be restricted to below 1,000 m. The study undertaken by Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>(2009) registered the species between 252 and 1,053 metres asl. Results from research undertaken in the Proyecto Mono Tocón show that at least 60% of the species’ original habitat has already been lost. </p>    <p>There is an urgent need for additional surveys of all potential habitats in San Martin, and larger tracts of forest. Mark (2003) notes that subpopulations near the banks of the Rio Mayo differ in colour from those in the Aguaruna territory in the north-east. DeLuycker (2006) reported a marked difference in pelage colour between a group she studied in a fragment near Moyobamba and those photographed by Noel Rowe. During surveys, attention should be given to the distributions of the different colour morphs (Mark 2003). Bóveda-Penalba<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> (2009) detected little difference in colour in individuals of the Alto Mayo, they argue that pelage colour varies depending on the lighting conditions. Some darker animals appeared much lighter when their bodies were turned in a different direction, making it difficult to determine differences in colour between Alto Mayo populations and the same was true for the quantity of white hair on the face. However, animals in the southern part of San Martin appear to be somewhat greyer than animals near Alto Mayo and usually do not have a a white mask (Tello-Alvarado J. C. pers comm). Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009) claim that the species lives in sympatry with another, undescribed species of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Callicebus</span> in the southern part of its range.

This species’ range may include the Bosque de Protección de Alto Mayo, which extends from the town of Rioja north along the border between the departments of San Martín and Amazonas, however more surveys are needed to confirm this as there species was registered once in a buffer zone of this protected area. During short surveys of the Reserve, no titis were detected in the high-altitude areas which make up most of the reserve. It is likely that the species only occurs in the low-altitude areas on the edges of the reserve (&lt;1%) (Rowe and Martinez 2003, DeLuycker 2006). Other protected areas in this species’ range include, Tarangue (74 ha), which belongs to a conservation organization called IKAMA Peru. The species also occurs in the Pabloyacu Reserve (640 ha) of the Universidad de San Martín, but despite its name this is not a protected area.</p>  <p>Mark (2003) and DeLuycker (2006) have emphasized the potential importance of both privately owned reserves and Amerindian reservations for the long-term conservation of this species. There are 14 indigenous Aguaruna communities located throughout the Alto Mayo region. The large tracts of forested land allocated to these well-organized communities could play a key role in conservation initiatives (Mark 2003). <br/> <br/> A team of scientists from NatureServe, Conservation Data Center - Peru/UNALM, and the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonia Peruana (IIAP) have recently completed part of a a project financed by the Moore foundation “Endemic Species and Ecological Systems of the Eastern Andean Slope and the Amazon Basin in Peru and Bolivia”.

Three groups, each with two members, were encountered at Puerto Santa Cruz, to the north of the Rio Yacuma. Aggressive displays were directed towards the researchers. Martinez and Wallace (2007) and Lopez-Strauss (2007) details average group sizes of 2.7 and 2 individuals respectively.","There is some forest loss and habitat fragmentation within its range. Groups surveyed by Felton <em>et al.</em> (2006) occurred in fragments surrounded by cattle ranches. A farmer in Naranjal reported seeing groups crossing grassland gaps (300–400 m) between patches of forest (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006) and this behaviour has since been confirmed (J. Martinez and Lopez pers. comm.). Uncontrolled grassland fires are also a major threat especially if they jump to forest patches (J. Martinez pers. comm.). Critically, the proposed major improvement to a regional road will exacerbate deforestation and is likely to increase hunting pressure (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The disappearance of the species from the type locality - La Laguna - indicates that they may be threatened locally by hunting (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006). They are used as bait for fishing and cat hunting and some are captured for pets.

In 2002, Felton <em>et al.</em> (2006) conducted titi monkey surveys and interviewed local residents at four locations: Puerto Santa Cruz on the Río Yacuma; the type locality of La Laguna; Petaca; and Naranjal. Titis were relatively abundant in Naranjal, not encountered in Petaca (although local residents claim they occur there), and are no longer present in La Laguna (probably exterminated through hunting). Examination of holotypes indicates that groups encountered in Rio Yacuma were <em>C. olallae</em>, while two of three groups found in Naranjal were <em>Callicebus modestus</em> (the third appeared to combine characters from both species).<br/><br/>Lopez-Strauss (2007) estimated density for both <em>C. olallae</em> and <em>C. modestus</em>s using calling behavior and an adapted point-count methodology. <em>C. olallae</em> presented conservative density estimates of between 1.8 and 11.5 groups per km² (Lopez-Strauss 2007).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Bolivia with very restricted range estimated to be 400 km² (Martinez and Wallace 2007).

Titis were relatively abundant in Naranjal, not encountered at all in Petaca (although local residents claim they occur there), and are no longer present in La Laguna (probably exterminated through hunting). Examination of the holotypes indicates that the Rio Yacuma groups were <em>C. olallae</em>, while two of three groups found in Naranjal were <em>Callicebus modestus</em> (the third appeared to combine characters from both species).<br/><br/>Lopez-Strauss (2007) estimated density for both <em>C. olallae</em> and <em>C. modestus</em> using calling behaviour and an adapted point-count methodology. Conservative density estimates were recorded for C. modestus between 0.9 and 12.4 groups/km² (Lopez-Strauss 2007).",Decreasing,"Endemic to Bolivia with very restricted range estimated at 1,800 km² (Martinez and Wallace 2007).

They are primarily insectivorous (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004). <em>Loris lydekkerianus nordicus</em> is apparently able to survive well near human habitations (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003), as it was found more often associated with disturbed human habitation than with forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004); similar trends in India were found by Singh <em>et al.</em> (1999) and were associated with agricultural pest abundance. The highest densities of lorises on Sri Lanka occurred in the dry zone forests; also, the presence of species of this genus is positively associated with insect presence, and negatively associated with secondary forest with little undergrowth (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004; Kumara <em>et al.</em> 2006). <em>L. l. nordicus</em> and <em>L.l. lydekkarianus</em> seem to rely heavily on undergrowth, and are often found in secondary growth forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004; Radhakrishna and Singh 2002).

Over this range of habitat types elephants are seen from sea level to over 3,000 m asl. In the Eastern Himalaya in northeast India, they regularly move up above 3,000 m asl in summer at a few sites (Choudhury, 1999). The Asian elephant is one of the last few mega-herbivores (i.e. plant-eating mammals that reach an adult body weight in excess of 1,000 kg) still extant on earth (Owen-Smith, 1988). Given their physiology and energy requirements, elephants need to consume large quantities of food per day. They are generalists and browse and graze on a variety of plants. The proportions of the different plant types in their diet vary depending upon the habitat and season. During dry season in southern India, Sukumar (1992) observed that 70% of the elephant's diet was browse, while in wet season, grasses make up about 55%. However, in an adjoining area, Baskaran (2002) observed that browse formed only 15% of the diet in dry deciduous forest and 47% of the diet in the thorn forest in the dry season, while the annual diet was dominated by grass (84%). In Sri Lanka, elephants may feed on more than 60 species of plants belonging to 30 families (McKay, 1973). In southern India, Baskaran (2002) recorded that elephants fed on 82 species of plants (59 woody plant species and 23 grass species). Elephants may spend up to 14–19 hrs a day feeding, during which they may consume up to 150 kg of wet weight (Vancuylenberg, 1977). They defecate about 16–18 times a day, producing about 100 kg of dung. Dung also helps disperse germinating seeds. <br/><br/>Elephants range over large areas and home ranges in excess of 600 km² have been recorded for females in south India (Baskaran <em>et al</em>., 1995). In north India, female home ranges of 184–326 km² and male home ranges of 188–407 km² have been recorded (Williams, 2002). Smaller home range sizes, 30–160 km² for females and 53–345 km² for males, have been recorded in Sri Lanka (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2005). Given their requirements for large areas, elephants are regarded as an “umbrella species” because their conservation will also protect a large number of other species occupying the same area. They are also a premier “flagship species” and are sometimes regarded as a “keystone species” because of their important ecological role and impact on the environment.<br/><br/>The life span of Asian elephants is 60 to 70 years, and males reach sexual maturity at between 10–15 years of age; females usually first give birth in years 15 or 16 (Shoshani and Eisenberg, 1982).","The pre-eminent threats to the Asian elephant today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation (Leimgruber <em>et al</em>., 2003; Sukumar, 2003; Hedges, 2006), which are driven by an expanding human population, and lead in turn to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when elephants eat or trample crops. Hundreds of people and elephants are killed annually as a result of such conflicts. The long-term future of elephants outside protected areas, as well as in some protected areas, is therefore inextricably linked to mitigating such human–elephant conflicts, and this is one of the largest conservation challenges in Asia today (Sukumar, 1992, 2003; Hedges 2006).<br/><br/>Asian elephants live in the region of the world with the densest human population, growing at a rate of between 1–3% per year. Because elephants require much larger areas of natural habitat than most other terrestrial mammals in Asia, they are one of the first species to suffer the consequences of habitat fragmentation and destruction and because of its great size and large food requirements, the elephant cannot co-exist with people in areas where agriculture is the dominant form of land-use. In extreme cases, elephants have been confined as so called ‘pocketed herds’ in small patches of forest in landscapes dominated by man. Such ‘pocketed herds’ represent an extreme stage in the human–elephant conflict (Olivier, 1978). In other cases elephants have been caught and taken to so-called Elephant Training Centres where they languish, lost to the wild population (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005, 2006). <br/><br/>Poaching is a major threat to elephants in Asia too, although reliable estimates of the number of elephants killed and the quantities of ivory and other body parts collected and traded are scarce (Sukumar <em>et al</em>., 1998; Milliken, 2005). It has been argued that poaching is a relatively minor threat to Asian elephant because some males and all females lack tusks (Dawson and Blackburn, 1991). However, the reality is that elephants are poached for a variety of other products (including meat and leather) in addition to ivory, and poaching is now acknowledged as a threat to the long-term survival of some Asian elephant populations (e.g. Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Menon, 2002). Moreover, poaching of elephants for ivory is a serious problem in some parts of Asia (Sukumar, 1992; Menon <em>et al</em>., 1997). In Periyar Tiger Reserve in southern India, for example, ivory poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios: over the 20-year period from 1969 to 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122 (Chandran, 1990). Selective removal of tusked males has several implications for the affected populations: sex ratios obviously become highly female biased, genetic variation is reduced, and fecundity and recruitment may decline (Sukumar <em>et al</em>., 1998; Sukumar, 2003). Poaching of elephants is also a major problem in other parts of Asia. Large-scale hunting of elephants for ivory, bushmeat, hides, and other products has reduced their populations significantly over a wide area from Myanmar to Indonesia (Menon <em>et al</em>., 1997; Duckworth and Hedges, 1998; Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Martin and Stiles, 2002; Menon, 2002; World Wide Fund for Nature, 2002a; Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005).","A recent estimate for the global population size of the Asian elephant was 41,410–52,345 animals Sukumar (2003) The estimated population size for each country was: Bangladesh 150–250; Bhutan 250–500; Cambodia 250–600; China 200–250; India 26,390–30,770; Indonesia 2,400–3,400; Lao PDR 500–1,000; Malaysia 2,100–3,100; Myanmar 4,000–5,000; Nepal 100–125; Sri Lanka 2,500–4,000; Thailand 2,500–3,200; and Viet Nam 70–150 (Sukumar, 2003) . However, Blake and Hedges (2004) and Hedges (2006) argue that the oft-repeated global population ‘estimate’ of about 40,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants is no more than a crude guess, which has been accepted unchanged for a quarter of a century. They argue that with very few exceptions all we really know about the status of Asian elephants is the location of some (probably most) populations, with in some cases a crude idea of relative abundance; and for some large parts of the species range we do not even know where the populations are, or indeed if they are still extant. These difference of opinion are due in part to the difficulty in counting elephants in dense vegetation in difficult terrain, different survey techniques being used in different places, and a too-widely held belief that population monitoring is unimportant. Nevertheless, whatever the error margins, it appears almost certain that over 50% of the remaining wild Asian elephants occur in India. <br/><br/>The overall population trend of the Asian elephant has been downwards, probably for centuries. This remains the case in most parts of its range, but especially in most of the countries of South-east Asia. Within India, there is evidence that the large population in the Western Ghats in south of the country has been increasing in recent years due to improved conservation effectiveness.",Decreasing,"Asian elephants formerly ranged from West Asia along the Iranian coast into the Indian subcontinent, eastwards into South-east Asia including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and into China at least as far as the Yangtze-Kiang. This former range covered over 9 million km² (Sukumar 2003). Asian elephants are now extinct in West Asia, Java, and most of China The western populations (<em>Elephas maximus asurus</em>) were probably extinct by 100 BC, and the main Chinese populations (sometimes referred to as <em>E. m. rubridens</em>) disappeared sometime after the 14th century BC. Even within its surviving range in South and South-east Asia, the species has been in retreat for hundreds if not thousands of years, and generally survives only in highly fragmented populations (Olivier 1978; Sukumar 2003; Blake and Hedges 2004).<br/><br/>Asian elephants still occur in isolated populations in 13 states, with a very approximate total range area of 486,800 km² (Sukumar 2003; but see Blake and Hedges 2004). The species occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in South Asia and Cambodia, China, Indonesia (Kalimantan and Sumatra) Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam in South-east Asia. Feral populations occur on some of the Andaman Islands (India).<br/><br/>The elephants of Borneo were believed to be feral descendants of elephants introduced in the 14th–19th centuries (Shoshani and Eisenberg, 1982; Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008); however, recent genetic evidence suggests they are indigenous to the island (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2003; but see Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008). <br/><br/>The species was once found throughout Sri Lanka, but today elephants are restricted mostly to the lowlands in the dry zone where they are still fairly widespread in north, south, east, north-western, north-central and south-eastern Sri Lanka; but with the exceptions of small remnant populations in the Peak Wilderness Area and Sinharaja Area, elephants are absent from the wet zone of the country. The species continues to lose range to development activities throughout the island. <br/><br/>Once widespread in India, the species is now restricted to four general areas: northeastern India, central India, northwestern India, and southern India. In northeastern India, the elephant range extends from the eastern border of Nepal in northern West Bengal through western Assam along the Himalaya foothills as far as the Mishmi Hills. From here it extends into eastern Arunachal Pradesh, the plains of upper Assam, and the foothills of Nagaland. Further west, it extends to the Garo Hills of Meghalaya through the Khasi Hills, to parts of the lower Brahmaputra plains and Karbi Plateau. Elsewhere in the south in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and the Barak valley districts of Assam, isolated herds occur (Choudhury, 1999). In central India, highly fragmented elephant populations are found in the States of Orissa, Jharkhand, and the southern part of West Bengal, with some animals wandering into Chattisgarh. In north-western India, the species occurs in six fragmented populations at the foot of the Himalayas in Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh, ranging from Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Bahraich Forest Division in the east, to the Yamuna River in the west. In southern India, elephants occur in the hilly terrain of the Western Ghats and in parts of the Eastern Ghats in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and, relatively recently, Andhra Pradesh. There are eight main populations in southern India, each fragmented from the others: northern Karnataka; the crestline of Karnataka–Western Ghats; Bhadra–Malnad; Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats; Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore; Anamalais–Parambikulam; Periyar–Srivilliputhur; and Agasthyamalais.<br/><br/>In Nepal, elephants were once widespread in the lowland Terai, but are now restricted to a few protected areas along the border with India: Royal Chitwan National Park, Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Royal Bardia National Park, and Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, and their environs. There is some movement of animals between these protected areas and between Bardia National Park and the adjacent parts of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, all the existing elephant populations are found along the border with India. They are reported from Royal Manas National Park, Namgyal Wangchuk Wildlife Sanctuary, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Reserve Forests such as Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary, Dungsum, and Mochu. In the past, elephants made seasonal migrations from Bhutan to the grasslands of India during the wetter summer months of May to October, returning to their winter range in Bhutan from November. Now these movements are restricted as a result of loss of habitat on the Indian side and fragmentation of habitat on the Bhutan side. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, the species was once widespread, but today it is largely restricted to areas that are relatively less accessible to humans, mainly Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the southeast. In addition, some animals periodically visit the New Samanbag area of Maulvi Bazar District under the Sylhet Forest Division in the north-east of the country, coming from the neighbouring Indian states of Tripura, Meghalaya, and Assam.<br/><br/>The Asian elephant has a wide, but highly fragmented, distribution in Myanmar. The five main areas of elephant abundance are: the Northern Hill Ranges, the Western Hill Ranges, Pegu Yoma (central Myanmar), Tenasserim Yoma (in the south, bordering Thailand), and Shan State or eastern Yoma.<br/><br/>In Thailand, the species occurs mainly in the mountains along the border with Myanmar, with smaller fragmented populations occurring in the peninsula in the south (in several forest complexes, south to the border with Malaysia); in the northeast (in the Dong Phaya Yen-Khao Yai forest complex, including Khao Yai National Park, and the Phu Khieo-Nam Nao forest complex); and in the east (in a forest complex composing the Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Khitchakut National Park, and Khao Cha Mao National Park).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, elephants are primarily found in the mountains of the south-west and in Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri Provinces. Recent surveys in Keo Sema District (Mondulkiri Province) suggest that important numbers may remain in that area (WCS unpubl. data). Elsewhere, Asian elephants persist in Cambodia in only small, scattered populations (Duckworth and Hedges, 1998).<br/><br/>In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, elephants remain widely but very patchily distributed in forested areas, both in the highlands and lowlands. Two important and likely viable populations are known, one in Xaignaboli Province west of the Mekong and one on the Nakai Plateau. Other potentially important elephant populations occur in Phou Phanang and Phou Khao Khoay in Vientiane Province; Phou Xang He in Savannakhet Province; Dong Ampham and Dong Khanthung, including Xe Pian, close to Cambodian border; and Nam Et, Nam Xam, Phou Dendin, and Nam Ha in the north, close to the Viet Namese and Chinese borders.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, only a small population persists now. In the northern part of the country there are no elephants left, barring occasional wanderers into Son La from Lao PDR. In the central and southern parts of the country, very small isolated populations remain in Dak Lak, Nghe An, Quang Nam, Dong Nai, and Ha Tinh Provinces. <br/><br/>In China, Asian elephants once ranged widely over much of southern China, including the Fujiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). The species was extirpated in southern Fujiang and northern Guangdong during the 12th century, but evidence indicates persistence in Guanxi into the 17th century (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). All that now remains of this once widespread elephant population in China is the remnant in Yunnan where the species survives in three prefectures: Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang.<br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, the species is still widely distributed in the interior of the country in the following States: Pahang (which probably has the largest population), Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Negeri Sembilan (where very few animals remain).<br/><br/>On Borneo, elephants only occur in the lowlands of the northeastern part of the island in the Malaysian State of Sabah and adjacent parts of Kalimantan (Indonesia). In Sabah, they occur in forested areas in the south, centre, and east of the State in the following Districts: Kinabatangan, Sandakan, Beluran, Lahad Datu, Tawau, and Pensiangan. In Kalimantan, elephants occur only in the Upper Sembakung River in Tindung District. The origin of the elephants of Borneo remains unclear and the subject of debate. Due to the limited distribution of the island’s elephant population it is argued by some that the species was not indigenous, but descended from imported captive elephants (Medway 1977; Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008). However, others argues that while captive elephants have undoubtedly been brought to Borneo, genetic analyses have shown that the elephants found on Borneo are genetically distinct, with molecular divergence indicating a Pleistocene colonization and subsequent isolation (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2003)<br/><br/>On Sumatra (in Indonesia), the elephant was once widespread, but now survives only in highly fragmented populations. In the mid-1980s, 44 discrete elephant populations were known to exist in Sumatra’s eight provinces, 12 of these were in Lampung Province (Blouch and Haryanto, 1984; Blouch and Simbolon, 1985). However, by 2003, only three of Lampung’s 12 populations were extant (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). An unknown number of Sumatra’s other elephant populations remain (Blake and Hedges, 2004), and those that do are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and as a result of conflict with humans (Santiapillai and Jackson, 1990; Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). Nevertheless, the island is thought to hold some of the most significant populations outside of India. For example, recent surveys in Lampung Province’s two national parks, Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas, produced population estimates of 498 (95% CI=[373, 666]) and 180 (95% CI=[144, 225]) elephants, respectively (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). Bukit Barisan Selatan NP is therefore a critically important area for Asian elephant conservation. The challenge now is to protect these populations from further habitat loss and poaching.","The Asian elephant is hunted for ivory, food, leather and other products. Live animals are also removed from the wild and used in forestry operations and for ceremonial purposes.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. The most important conservation priorities for the Asian elephant are: 1) conservation of the elephant's habitat and maintaining habitat connectivity by securing corridors; 2) the management of human–elephant conflicts as part of an integrated land-use policy that recognizes elephants as economic assets from which local people need to benefit or at least no suffer; 3) better protection to the species through improved legislation and law enforcement, improved and enhanced field patrolling, and regulating/curbing trade in ivory and other elephant products. Monitoring of conservation interventions is also needed to assess the success or failure of the interventions so that adjustments can be made as necessary (i.e. adaptive management). Reliable estimation of population size and trends will be needed as part of this monitoring and adaptive management approach.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Other prey include ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares.  Cheetahs, unlike other African predators, rarely scavenge and do not remain long with their kills, many of which are stolen by other carnivores.  Cheetahs are primarily active during the day, unlike other predators, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are primarily found in open grassy habitats, but also make use of dry forest, savanna woodland, semi-desert and scrub, being absent from tropical rainforest.  There are reports of cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In the central Sahara, cheetahs occur in high mountain habitat - the Saharan mountains are hyper-arid, but still receive slightly higher rainfall than the surrounding desert.  They are thus better vegetated and support small permanent waterholes and antelope populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Cheetah habitat in Iran consists of desert, much of it with precipitation of fewer than 100 mm per year. The terrain ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m. The vegetation, if any, consists of a sparse cover of shrubs, most less than one meter tall, of the genera <em>Salsola</em>, <em>Artemisia</em>, <em>Zygophyllum</em>, <em>Astragulus</em>, <em>Aphaxis</em>, and others. Gazelles <em>Gazella subgutturosa</em> and <em>G. bennetti</em> were preferred prey, but they have now become scarce through over-hunting and replacement by livestock (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Opportunistic recovery of cheetah kills suggests that wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian ibex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are the key prey species today though none are considered optimal for cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among the felids.  Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three.  Some coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group.  Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, which remain attached to and mate with the females in a single pride, cheetah male coalitions mate with as many females as possible (Caro 1994), and females show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Female cheetahs in areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains) follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km²) and attempt to mate with females passing through (Durant <em>et al</em>. 1988; Caro 1994).  However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females have smaller, overlapping ranges that are similar in size (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  On Namibian farmlands, where prey is non-migratory, both cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km²); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range.  The reasons for such large home ranges were unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002).   <br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for lions, leopards, tigers and jaguars in prime habitat: Durant, 2007).  On the Serengeti plains, cheetah densities range from 0.8-1.0 per 100 km², but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km² (Caro 1994).  Caro (1994) attributes lower cheetah densities to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as lions and hyenas that can kill cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands, where lions and hyenas have been eradicated, cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km²) (Marker 2002).","In Eastern Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation was identified as the primary threat during a conservation strategy workshop (Anon. 2007).   Because cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of cheetahs (Durant 2007).<br/><br/>A depleted wild ungulate prey base is of serious concern in northern Africa (Berzins and Belbachir 2006).  Cheetahs which turn to livestock are killed as pests (Claro 2003; Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 2003; Wacher <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Conflict with farmers and depletion of the wild prey base are also considered significant threats in parts of Eastern Africa (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah <em>A. j. venaticus</em> is threatened indirectly by loss of prey base through human hunting activities. In addition, most protected areas are open to seasonal livestock grazing, which potentially places huge pressure on the resident ungulate populations through disturbance and potential competition (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, domestic dogs accompanying the herds present a likely threat to both cheetahs and their prey (H. Ziaie pers. comm. 2008)  An emerging threat is the possibility of fragmentation into discontinuous subpopulations as a result of increasing developmental pressures (mining, oil, roads, railways); this is particularly the case in Kavir N.P., currently the north-western limit of the Asiatic Cheetah's range (L. Hunter and L. Marker pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Conflict with farmers and ranchers is the major threat to cheetahs in southern Africa (Purchase <em>et al</em>. 2007).  Cheetah are often killed or persecuted because they are a perceived threat to livestock, despite the fact that they cause relatively little damage. In Namibia, very large numbers of cheetahs have been live-trapped and removed by ranchers seeking to protect their livestock (from government permit records, Nowell [1996] calculated that over 9,500 cheetahs were removed from 1978-1995).  While removal rates have fallen, in part due to intensified conservation and education efforts, many ranchers still view cheetahs as a problem animal, despite research showing that cheetahs were only responsible for 3% of livestock losses to predators (Marke, 2002). Although cheetah in Iran have been killed because of predation on livestock, since 2003, there has been no direct evidence of killing cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007), though it is likely most incidents go unreported. <br/><br/>Cheetahs are also vulnerable to being caught in snares set for other species (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>Another threat to the cheetah is interspecific competition with other large predators, especially lions. On the open, short-grass plains of the Serengeti, juvenile mortality can be as high as 95%, largely due to predation by lions (Laurenson 1994). However, mortality rates are lower in more closed habitats (Caro in press). <br/><br/>CITES allows legal trade in live animals and hunting trophies under an Appendix I quota system (annual quotas: Namibia - 150; Zimbabwe - 50; Botswana - 5).  This was accepted by CITES as a way to enhance the economic value of cheetahs on private lands and provide an economic incentive for their conservation (Nowell 1996).  The global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining; cheetahs breed poorly in captivity and in 2001 30% of the captive population was wild-caught (Marker 2002).  While analysis of trade records in the CITES database shows that these countries have reported almost no live exports since the late 1990s, Purchase <em>et al.</em> (2007) are concerned that there is a substantial illegal cross-border trade in live animals.  There is also concern about illegal trade in skins, as well as capture of live cubs for trade to the Middle East (Anon. 2007).  There is an increasing trade in cubs from north-east Africa into the Middle East (Amir 2005),  but there is currently little trade in cubs from the Sahel region, where it was previously considered a major problem (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are active during the daytime and there is concern that they can be driven off their kills by tourist cars crowding around, or mothers separated from their cubs.  Burney (1980) conducted a study and concluded that tourist cars did not seem to harm cheetahs, and in fact sometimes helped, as cheetah chases more often ended in a kill when there were cars around, distracting prey, providing cover from which to stalk, or otherwise waking cheetahs up to notice prey in the area.  However, tourist numbers have risen sharply by then, and its potential impact on cheetahs remains a concern (Caro 1994; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>The Eastern African cheetah conservation strategy (Anon. 2007) identified four sets of constraints to mitigating these threats across a large spatial scale.  Political constraints include lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability in some ecologically important areas, and lack of political will to foster cheetah conservation.  Economic constraints include lack of financial resources to support conservation, and lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife.  Social constraints include negative conceptions of cheetahs, lack of capacity to achieve  conservation, lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes leading to subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation.  These potentially mutable human constraints contrast with several biological constraints which are characteristic of cheetahs and cannot be changed, including wide-ranging behaviour, negative interactions with other large carnivores, and potential susceptibility to disease.<br/><br/>Disease is a potential threat to the cheetah (Anon. 2007), as its reduced genetic diversity can increase a population's susceptibility  (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1983).  However, the most serious disease mortality thus far documented in wild cheetahs was from naturally occurring anthrax in Namibia's Etosha National Park; cheetahs, unlike other predators, do not scavenge carcasses of ungulates killed by anthrax, and thus had no built-up immunity when they preyed upon springbok sick with the disease (Lindeque <em>et al</em>. 1998).  The cheetah's low density may offer some measure of protection against infectious disease; for example, cheetahs were not affected by an outbreak of Canine Distemper Virus in the Serengeti National Park which killed over 1/3 of the lion population.  Serological surveys of cheetahs on Namibian farmland indicate some exposure and survival of the disease (Marker 2002).","Southern Africa is the cheetah's regional stronghold, with a ""roughly"" estimated population of at least 4,500 adults (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).  This regional estimate breaks down as follows:  Angola - present but unknown; Botswana - 1,800; Malawi - &lt;25 (and probably extirpated: Purchase and Purchase 2007); Mozambique: &lt;50; Namibia - 2,000; South Africa - 550; Zambia - 100; Zimbabwe - 400.  A large proportion of the estimated population lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game, and where lions and hyenas have been extirpated.<br/><br/>The number of known resident cheetahs in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents.  Most population estimates were derived from applying a density estimate of one adult per 100 km² to mapped resident range areas during a conservation strategy workshop, although a few are based on research.  Only four of the 15 known populations were estimated to number &gt;200 animals; the largest population (Serengeti/Maro/Tsavo in Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 710.  It would be much smaller if unprotected lands were included.  Overall, less than half of the estimated cheetah population inhabits protected areas.  In addition, approximately half lives in habitat blocks which are trans-boundary, requiring international cooperation for conservation of the population.  Cheetahs possibly occur over an area which is several times as large as the range of the known population (Anon. 2007).  <br/><br/>These estimates can be compared with previous population estimates based on extensive field interviews and application of density estimates.  There is rough accord for Kenya at 793 (Gros 1998) and Tanzania at 569-1,007 (Gros 2002).  However, in Uganda, Gros and Rejmanek (1999) estimated 40-295 with a wider range in the Karamoja region, whereas now cheetahs have been extirpated and just 12 are estimated to persist in Kidepo National Park and surroundings (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In the remainder of Africa, there are few reliable population estimates.  Cheetahs are considered extinct or possibly extinct in many countries (Marker 2002).  In northwest Africa the population is probably fewer than 250 mature individuals and the subspecies A. j. heckii is listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>In Asia cheetahs are now known to exist only in Iran, where the subspecies A. j. venaticus is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007) and listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>The known cheetah population is not much greater than 7,000, and the total population is unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, thus meeting the criteria for Vulnerable.  The current known population is half the 15,000 estimated by Myers (1975) from his continental status assessment.  The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) could be less than half of the total population (Kelly 2001). <br/><br/>While the current rate of population decline is of most concern, and the historical rate of decline has been severe (Nowell and Jackson, 1996; Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005), attention has also focused on the cheetah's having perhaps suffered even more extreme losses in the distant past.  The cheetah species exhibits remarkably low levels of genetic diversity in comparison to other felids (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1986) (but not compared to carnivores in general: Merola 1994).  This is consistent with inbreeding among a very few individuals surviving one or more catastrophic population bottlenecks in the past, with the first possibly occurring during the late Pleistocene extinctions, around 10,000 years ago, according to analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien 1995).  <br/><br/>It is unclear what sort of agent could have caused such an extreme population decline in a wide-ranging species, and alternative explanations have been explored.  Hedrick (1996) suggested the low levels of genetic variation could result from a very low effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population that is actually passing on its genes), and Kelly's (2001) calculations of effective population size in cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains were quite low (44% or less of the actual population).  She found that only a few females contributed disproportionately to future generations by raising offspring which survived and reproduced (Kelly 2001).  Genetic analysis by Gottelli <em>et al.</em> (2007) showed that male cheetahs, on the other hand, passed on their genes more successfully than expected.  Female cheetahs mated with multiple males, many non-resident, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity.  This indicates that rates of genetic loss should be lower than anticipated by Kelly (2001), and underscores the importance of cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.   <br/><br/>While the causes of the cheetah's low levels of genetic variation are unclear, what is clear is that large populations are necessary to conserve it.  Since cheetahs are a low density species, conservation areas need to be quite large, larger than most protected areas.",Stable,"Cheetahs have disappeared from huge areas of their historic range.  They still occur widely, but sparsely, in Africa, but Ray <em>et al.</em> (2005) estimate that the cheetahs have disappeared from 76% of their historic range on the continent.<br/><br/>In Asia, the cheetah has lost almost all its vast historic range, which within the last century extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Habibi 2004; Mallon 2007).  Part of the reason for their disappearance in Asia is live captures of cheetahs, which were trained to hunt for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh, 1995).  The main cause, however, was likely depletion of the wild prey base, especially gazelles, as well as direct killing of cheetahs and development of their habitat (Mallon, 2007).  The Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered.  Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001).  While Habibi (2004) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, a cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, although there has been significant range loss in parts of these regions.  Cheetahs are known to occur only in 6% of their historical range in Eastern Africa (310,586 km²), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (Anon. 2007).  Current distribution in several countries remains largely unknown (Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Angola, Mozambique and Zambia).  Cheetahs are known to be extirpated from large areas in Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi (Anon. 2007, 2008).  In some parts of southern Africa they occur extensively outside protected areas on commercial ranch land where other large predators (lions and hyenas) have been extirpated (Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe) (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined most drastically in northern and western Africa (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).  The subspecies (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information on northwest Africa.  <br/><br/>Cheetah persistence in the eastern Sahara is unlikely.<br/><br/>Cheetahs are possibly extinct in Libya. Specimens were previously collected near the Egyptian border (northeastern part of the country), in Dahra, Sirtica (north-central), Bir Ghazal and Hamada-el-Homra (northwestern). Other records include Fezzan, Khor-el-Gifa, Gikherra (eastern), El Ftaia (near coastal area) and Mizda (Hufnagl 1972). Myers (1975) mentioned that cheetahs were noted in Niger/Libyan borders as well as Niger/Algerian borders. An inquiry with local Tuaregs suggested that the species might not longer be present in Akoukas Mountains (J.-L. Bernezat pers. comm. 2007).  <br/><br/>In Tunisia, cheetahs were formerly reported to roam in sandy expanses south of Chott-el-Djerid, the desert areas south of Foum Tatahouine and the Grand Erg Occidental and its surroundings (Schomber and Kock 1960). There are no recent records on the species in the country which make it presumably extinct. The El-Borma region, near the Algerian boundaries, was probably among the areas where cheetahs have last been seen in 1974 and documented (Louis 1979).  <br/><br/>As far as Egypt is concerned, data collated during the last few decades suggest that cheetahs are extremely rare, if not extinct, in the country. Osborn and Helmy (1980) provided original and literature-based records from the Matrouh Governorate and Sinai. According to Saleh <em>et al</em>. (2001), cheetahs became extinct from most of the Mediterranean coastal region and easily accessible inland habitats of El-Maghra and Siwa oases one decade after being widely distributed in the northern Egyptian Western Desert until the 1970s. The main reasons explaining cheetah extirpation have been attributed to extensive and uncontrolled hunting and the development of coastal lands (Saleh <em>et al</em>. 2001). If not completely vanished, the species is believed to be confined, with a very low density, to the Western Desert and around the Qattara Depression (Saleh <em>et al</em>., 2001; Hoath, 2003). Recent records from North Sinai, including one female and three cubs killed by Bedouin hunters in 1993, as well as one female seen with two cubs in November 1994, have not been verified (Hoath 2003). <br/><br/>In the eastern Sahel and central Africa, there is little current information:<br/><br/>Current cheetah distribution in most of its historic range in Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia are unknown (Anon. 1997).  In Chad, although cheetahs were still present and seen occasionally in Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim in the 1970s (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008). A recent wildlife survey in western and central Chad, including Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve, conducted by the Sahelo-Saharan Interest Group in 2001, failed to detect any cheetah presence in the region (Monfort <em>et al</em>. 2003). In the Central Saharan (northern) part of the country, cheetahs still occur, in very low density, in and around the Ennedi Massif (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008 based on Rava's pers. comm.). There is no information on previously reported populations in the Tibesti Mountains (Central Sahara). In southeastern Chad, cheetahs may still survive to date in Zakouma National Park (population still present in the protected area as of 2006 [N. Vanherle pers. comm. 2008]). <br/><br/>In central Africa, current cheetah distribution in the savanna regions of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo is unknown (Marker 2002).  It is considered extinct in Rwanda and Burundi, and possibly extinct in Nigeria.  Rosevear (1974) underlined the paucity of positive records for Nigeria and mentioned Lake Chad, Yan Tumaki (Katsina Division) and possibly Bauchi Plateau as localities for three specimens kept in the British Museum. Happold (1987) raised the possibility of their occurrence near Cameroonian boundaries, and also in the Yankari Game Reserve (Happold 1987). Recent reports from protected area managers and wildlife traders indicate that a threatened small cheetah population may still range in restricted areas in north-centre and northeastern parts of the country (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2008).","Cheetahs are hunted for sport and trophies, as well as handicrafts products. Live animals are also traded - the global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining. Pest animals are also removed.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson, 1996. However, a number of countries permit cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock (Purchase <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  In Namibia, for example, one is permitted to retain the skin as long as the killing is reported  (Nowell, 1996).  Such policies may at least permit cheetah killing to be monitored.<br/><br/>Promotion of livestock management regimes which minimize conflict with cheetahs are an important conservation measure, pioneered by the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia (Marker <em>et al.</em>, 2003) but now being applied more widely.  Elements of successful conservation management include availability of wild prey and more intensive livestock herd protection, especially using guard dogs.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Cheetah is protected in Iran. The main protected areas for this species include Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park and Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh P.A., and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge. A radio-telemetry study in Iran is providing the first detailed data on cheetahs in Iran (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Several countries, including Namibia and Kenya, have developed national action plans or conservation strategies for cheetahs (Nowell, 1996; Durant, 2007); regional conservation strategies have been developed for Southern (Dickman <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Anon., 2008) and Eastern Africa (Anon., 2007); and there is also a global strategy (Bartels <em>et al.</em>, 2002).  These plans call for a number of improvements in monitoring, surveys and information exchange (to better understand cheetah distribution and status); promotion of human-cheetah coexistence (to reduce conflict and develop incentives to conserve cheetahs); national land use planning (to ensure viable national cheetah populations); capacity building (to improve management); policy and legislation (to ensure legal consistency and remove loopholes) and advocacy (to raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation needs).<br/><br/>Several specialist networks of cheetah conservationists have been established, including the Global Cheetah Forum (affiliated with the IUCN Conservation Breeding Specialist Group) and the North African Regional Cheetah Action Group (NARCAG/OGRAN).  The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (www.catsg.org)<br/><br/>Important protected areas that represent strongholds for Cheetah populations in Africa include the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa, Botswana), Nxai Pan and Chobe National Parks, and Okavango Delta (Botswana), Etosha N.P. (Namibia), Liuwa Plains N.P. (Zambia), and, of course, the Serengeti N.P. (Tanzania, Kenya) (Caro in press). In West Africa, the major remaining stronghold for the species is the WAPO protected areas complex. There is a surviving population of Cheetah in the Ahaggar National Park in Algeria (Wacher <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>However, most cheetah occur outside of protected areas (where they are often persecuted as pests), and given their need for large areas they require conservation action on a landscape scale (for example, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, zoning for land-use to maintain habitat connectivity, and wild prey restoration) (Marker, 2002; Anon., 2007).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean
13094441,914,Alouatta pigra,Endangered,A4cd,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This species is listed as Endangered as it is estimated that this species will experience a decline approaching 60% over a period of three generations (30 years) based on past and current rates of habitat decline and continued hunting for food and capture for pets.,"This species occurs in primary <em>terra firma</em> rain forest, riparian forest, seasonally flooded riparian areas, and swamps. However, it can be also found in primary and secondary forest. In areas where suitable habitat does not exist they in some cases be found in marginal habitat surrounded by pastures and urban areas (Cuarón 1991, 1997; Marsh, 1999, 2001, 2002). In Calakmul, Mexico and Tikal, Guatemala, they occur in semideciduous tropical forest, but in Yaxchilán in tall evergreen rain forest (Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species is mainly found in areas below 900 m, but more commonly below 400 m. However, Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) found them in locations up to 3,350 m asl. Reid (1997) reported that it is found in evergreen and semideciduous forest, remnant forest along rivers and tall second growth.<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaws which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 kms (Drubbel and Gautier 1993).<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria. Silver <em>et al.</em> (1998, 2000) have studied the diet and feeding ecology of <em>A. pigra</em> in Belize.<br/><br/><em>Alouatta pigra</em> lives in smaller groups than <em>A. palliata</em>: 2-10 individuals per group compared with 2-45 for <em>A. palliata</em> (mean of 12.3) (Crockett and Eisenberg 1986; Chapman and Balcomb 1998; Pavelka and Chapman 2006). Estrada <em>et al</em>. (2004) recorded a mean group size of 7.5±1.9 individuals (range 4-9, n=8) at Calakmul, Campeche; 6.6±2.1 individuals (range 4-10, n=8) at Yaxchilán, Chiapas; and 8.7±2.2 individuals (range 6-12, n=10) at Tikal, Guatemala. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Infant <em>Alouatta</em> are probably born throughout the year in Suriname, but data are not yet sufficient to determine if there is a birth peak. In Suriname, newborn infants have been seen in March, April, and November, and January (Mittermeier 1977). Crockett and Rudran (1987a,b) examined seasonal variation in births in red howlers from northern Venezuela, and found that they were less frequent during the early wet season (weaning would occur at the time of greatest food shortage). The llanos forests are more seasonal, however, than in the Guianas, and it is possible that this is not the case elsewhere. Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult male weight 11.1-11.6 kg (mean 11.35 kg, n=2), adult female weight 6.3-6.6 kg (mean 6.4 kg, n=4) (Ford and Davis 1992)<br/>Adult male weight 11.4 kg (n=2) (Peres 1994)<br/>Adult female weight 6.43 kg (n=4) (Peres 1994).","The main threats to this species are deforestation, hunting (for food and for capture as pets) and disease (yellow fever epidemics) (Reid 1997; Pavelka and Chapman 2006).","<em>Alouatta pigra</em> is locally common across its range, but mainly in protected areas. In Belize, this species has been recorded at densities of up to 250 individuals/km² in some areas.<br/><br/>Estrada <em>et al</em>. (2004, 2006) carried out surveys of <em>A. pigra</em> populations in a number of areas in Guatemala and Mexico: Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Campeche, 15.2 individuals/km²; Yaxchilán Natural Monument, Chiapas, 12.8 individuals/km²; and Tikal National Park, Guatemala, 17.8 individuals/km²; Palenque, Chiapas 23 individuals/km². At 13 sites where Estrada <em>et al.</em> (2006) estimated densities of <em>A. pigra</em>, the mean density was 10.8±5.7 individuals/km² (range 3.5-23 individuals/km²).",Decreasing,"<em>Alouatta pigra</em> occurs in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico and Belize, extending into northern and central Guatemela. The westernmost locality given by Hall (1981) is at Frontera, in the Mexican state of Tabasco; <em>A. palliata</em> has been recorded just west of there along the coast, 6 miles south of Cárdenas. Further localities which define the western and southern limits to its range include 5 miles south-east of Macuspana, Tabasco, and San Mateo Ixtatán (c. 11,000 ft) in Guatemala. Smith (1970) identified the southern limits to its range in the east with three localities along the Río Motagua basin in Guatemala, including Quirigua and Zacapa (right bank of the river). Curdts (1993), on the other hand, found that the southern and south-western limits to the range of <em>A. pigra</em> in Guatemala were defined by the Lago de Izabal, El Golfete and the Río Dulce. He noted large numbers of <em>A. pigra</em> in the Río Polochic delta, entering the west end of the Lago de Izabal. These are just to the north of the Río Motagua, where Curdts (1993) identified <em>A. palliata</em>. Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) found <em>A. pigra</em> in the northern margin of Rio Dulce and Lago Izabal, and to the West of Lago Izabal. This marks the southernmost locality for <em>A. pigra</em> in the Sierra de las Minas. <br/><br/>Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) provide the most recent review of the limits of the distributions of <em>Alouatta palliata</em> and <em>A. pigra</em> in Central America and Mexico. They found that the highland massif of northern Central America (including the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and central highland of Guatemala) and its associated coniferous and subalpine vegetation forms a geographic barrier separating <em>A. pigra</em> from <em>A. palliata</em>, and defines the southern limit of <em>A. pigra</em>. They discussed the two contact zones between them: the broad range of overlap north of the highland massif in Mexico over the lowlands of the states of Tabasco and Campeche, and a narrow area of contiguous, non-overlapping ranges in eastern Guatemala where the highlands extend almost the Caribbean. In the first, the localities where parapatry has been observed include Macuspana, Tabasco (Smith 1970; Horwich and Johnson 1986), around Zapata, Tabasco (Horwich and Johnson 1986) and the northern point of the Laguna de Términos in Campeche (Serio-Silva <em>et al.</em> 2006). There is no geographical barrier separating the species, both occur in the same forests and on both sides of the Rio Usamacinta, for example (Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In the second, the ranges are narrowly parapatric, separated by the Río Dulce and the Lago Izabal: <em>A. palliata</em> to the south and <em>A. pigra</em> to the north and west. South-west of Lake Izabal, <em>A. pigra</em> occurs in the highlands of the Sierra de las Minas, but not in the lowlands, occupied by <em>A. palliata</em>. Any past range overlap in this region will have been lost by the extensive oss of forest; the area is heavily farmed.  Baumgarten (2006) found no evidence to support sympatry supposed previously by Horwich and Johnson (1986), Curdts (1993) and Silva-López <em>et al.</em> (1998).<br/><br/>Serio-Silva <em>et al</em>.

The most commonly consumed arboreal food sources were <em>Cercropia montana</em>, <em>C. utcubamba</em>, <em>Hyeronima andina</em>, <em>Ficus eximia</em>, <em>Ficus</em> spp. <em>Ocotea dasyflora</em>, <em>Erythrina edulis</em>, <em>Styloceras laurifolium</em>, <em>Podocarpus oleifolius</em>, <em>Croton lechleri</em>,<em> Chrysophyllum venezuelanense</em>, <em>Clausia</em> sp. and <em>Allophylus</em> sp. (Shanee 2014). <em>Lagothrix flavicauda</em> modify their diets according to resource availability between the wet and dry seasons, consuming more leaves and insects when fruits are scarce (Shanee 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Size: <br/></strong>About 10 kg (Leo Luna 1984).","Relative inaccessibility of this species’ cloud forest habitat served as protection for <em>Lagothrix flavicauda</em> up until the 1950s (Leo Luna 1987, 1989). Subsequently, road construction, selective logging and subsistence hunting have led to deforestation, forest fragmentation and population declines (Aquino and Encarnación 1994, Butchart <em>et al</em>. 1995, DeLuycker 2007, DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2007, Shanee 2011). More recently, mining operations have increased in this high mountain region. Leo Luna (1984) estimated 11,240 km² of remaining suitable forest habitat for this species in 1981. Buckingham and Shanee (2008) estimated 6,302 km² remaining in 2008, representing a prior average annual forest loss of over 180 km², and noted that 70% of the remaining forest habitat was unprotected. Peruvian ministry reports and GCF data suggest a slightly higher annual forest loss rate (210 km²/year) for San Martin Province, the core of this species range, over the period 2010-2017. These data would seem to suggest that the loss of nearly all remaining unprotected habitat within this species’ range is possible if current rates of deforestation continue to the year 2030.<br/><br/>In addition,<em> L. flavicauda</em> is heavily hunted by indigenous communities, market hunters and in retaliation for crop damage. Infants are also routinely taken as pets when mothers are killed (DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee 2012).","Estimates of current population size for this species vary widely with the best estimates between approximately 1,000 and 10,000 individuals (Mittermeier and Rylands 2013, Shanee and Shanee 2014). This species lives at fairly low population densities of 0.25-1 group per km²&#160;in Rio Abiseo National Park (Leo Luna 1987), 0.93-1.28 groups per km²&#160;at La Esperanza, Amazonas department (Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015) and 0.93-2.24 groups per km² in the Abra Patricia-Alto Nieva Private Conservation Area (Cornejo 2007).",Decreasing,"The Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey is endemic to the montane rain forests and cloud forests of the Departments of San Martín (eastern part) and Amazonas (south western part) in the Peruvian Andes, south and east of the Río Marañón, at altitudes of 1,100 to 2,700 asl (Shanee 2011, Pitman <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Allgas <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). This species also occurs in smaller areas of La Libertad, Huánuco and Loreto (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1975; 1977; Graves and O'Neil 1980; Leo Luna 1980, 1982, 1989; Parker and Barkley 1981; Shanee 2011; Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2014). Its distribution is limited in the north and northwest of Amazonas by the Maranon River valley, to the northeast by the lowlands of Loreto on the border with San Martin, in the east by the Huallaga River Valley. It extends south to either the Santa Martha or Magdalena river valleys in Huánuco. To the southwest and west in Huánuco, La Libertad, and San Martin this species is limited by the high cordillera to the east of the Maranon River. This limit continues north along this line to the start of the Utcubamba River in Amazonas, where it continues until joining with the Maranon River again in the northwest of Amazonas east of the Cordillera Colan.

This is based upon Global Forest Watch data for southeastern Mexico south through Central America, into western Colombia and Ecuador, and extreme northern Peru. The data suggests that, should forest loss continue at the same rate that has impacted the previous generation (2003-2018), 19% of this species’ suitable habitat is likely to be lost by the year 2048.

In average mantled howlers spend 21% of their time feeding (range 8–40 %, Dias and Negrin 2015). They mainly consume fruits and leaves, but the relative proportions vary by study site, with some populations being mostly folivorous while others have a more equal share of fruits and leaves in their diets. Other food items include flowers, petioles, buds, etc. (see Dias and Negrin 2015 for a detailed review of howler diets).<br/><br/>Group size varies considerably, with some locations reporting sizes of 40 or more individuals in a single group (in Mexico and Costa Rica), although the average group size is 15.2 individuals (Dias and Negrin 2015). Groups include multiple males and females, with a sex ration of 1.79 females per male (Chapman and Balcomb 1998).

In Mexico a number of studies have reported variable densities between 23.29 (Estrada 1982) and 105 ind./km²&#160;(Serio-Silva &amp; Rico-Gray 2002). In Costa Rica, population densities between 4.9 and 30 ind./km²&#160;have been estimated for <em>A. p. palliata</em> (see Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2011) and 0.2 and 0.1 groups/km² were reported in protected areas (see Glander 2013). In Nicaragua this subspecies is known to occur in densities of 0.21 individuals/ha in fragmented habitats (Williams-Guillen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Densities above 90 ind./km²&#160;are reported for <em>A. p. palliata</em> and <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em> in Panama (Chiriqui 1,050, Baldwin and Baldwin 1972, 1976; and BCI 91.7, Milton 1982, respectively). In Colombia, Ramírez-Orjuela and Sánchez-Dueñas (2005) estimated between 0.7 and 1.5 ind./km² for <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em>, but Glander (2013) comments that there are reports of 20 ind./km² in the same general region in Colombia. Population density of <em>A. p. trabeata</em> in the Azuero Peninsula shows great variability, with some areas holding up to 42 ind./km², whereas other areas having as low as 0.5 ind./km² (Average 5.2 ind./km², Méndez-Carvajal 2013). The density of the Coiba Island howler (<em>A. p. coibensis</em>) was estimated to an average of 4.1 groups/km² (17.6 ind/km²) and a total population of 472 individuals (Mendez-Carvajal 2012).<br/><br/>A population reduction of 30% or more is inferred over the course of three generations. This is based upon Global Forest Watch data (Global Forest Watch 2020) for southeastern Mexico south through Central America, into western Colombia and Ecuador, and extreme northern Peru. The data suggests that, should forest loss continue at the same rate that has been seen since 2003, close to 30% of this species’ suitable habitat is likely to be lost by the year 2048. In addition, the species is threatened by hunting.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Alouatta palliata</em> is distributed from the southern portion of the state of Veracruz in Mexico, and extends south through the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco, throughout Central America and the Pacific Coast and western slopes of the Andes in Colombia and Ecuador, reaching the Tumbes region in northern Peru.<br/><br/>There are five recognized subspecies:<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata palliata</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>This subspecies is distributed from southern Guatemala to western Panama. However, the limits separating <em>A. p. palliata</em> from<em> A. p. aequatorialis</em> are not clear. Lawrence (1933) cited a specimen of <em>A. p. palliata</em> from Cotó, extreme western Panama, and Hill (1962, p.106) mentioned that specimens from Sevilla Island, western Panama, collected by J. H. Batty were “manifestly” <em>A. p. palliata</em>. Hall (1981), on the other hand, lists Sevilla Island, and Puerto Cortez, Costa Rica, as marginal records for <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em>. Lawrence (1933) comments that many individuals from Panama are intermediate. Based on mitochondrial DNA analyses, Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> (2003) reported two clades separating <em>A. p. palliata</em>/<em>A. p. coibensis</em>/ <em>A. p. mexicana</em> from <em>A. p. trabeata</em>/<em>A. p aequatorialis</em>, and mentioned that these two clades were divided around the Sona Peninsula in western Panama (Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2003). Consistent with this view, recent analyses of individuals from Limones in Punta Burica Panama (Cortés-Ortiz unpubl.) show that their mitochondrial DNA haplotypes cluster with those from <em>A. p. palliata</em> from Costa Rica. To the north, <em>A. p. palliata</em> extends through Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras reaching the south margin of Rio Dulce in southern Guatemala, where it may be sympatric with <em>A. pigra</em> (Curdts 1993, Baumgarten and Williamson 2007). It is not known to currently occur in El Salvador (Burt and Stirton 1961), but it is likely that it occurred there in the past (Daugherty 1972).<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata mexicana</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>The distribution of <em>A. p. mexicana</em> ranges from southern Veracruz state in Mexico extending southeast to northeastern Oaxaca (Ortiz-Martínez <em>et al.</em> 2008), western Tabasco, and northern Chiapas (see Serio-Silva <em>et al.</em> 2006). In Tabasco <em>A. p. mexicana</em> is sympatric with <em>A. pigra </em>(Smith 1970) and hybridization has been confirmed in that region (Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2015b). Serio-Silva <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported the presence of <em>A. p. mexicana</em> in Campeche, Mexico, based on the observation of individuals with atypical white hairs on the flanks of their bodies. Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> (in prep.) have analysed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from individuals in Campeche with similar coloration patterns and concluded that they are <em>A. pigra</em>, and not <em>A. palliata</em> or hybrid individuals. The reason for the presence of white hairs in the pelage of <em>A. pigra</em> individuals remains unclear. Although several published maps include the range of this subspecies extending into the highlands of Chiapas and north-central Guatemala, a study by A. Cuarón (unpublished) revealed that its range is restricted to western Chiapas, central and western Tabasco, southern Veracruz, and northeastern Oaxaca. Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) argued that <em>A. palliata</em> could have occurred on the Pacific side of the highland massif of northern Central America. There are historical records that suggest the presence of <em>A. palliata</em> (putatively <em>A. p. mexicana</em>) in this region in Mexico (Estrada and Coates-Estrada 1984) and Guatemala (Handley 1950), but no current populations are reported.<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata aequatorialis<br/></strong>Alouatta palliata aequatorialis</em> occurs in eastern Panama extending through the Serranía del Darién (Anthony 1916, Lawrence 1933) to western Colombia, Ecuador and into the Tumbes region of northwestern Peru (Aquino and Encarnación 1994; Encarnación and Cook 1998; Tirira 2001, 2007). In northern Colombia <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em> is sympatric with <em>A. seniculus</em> in the left banks of the Peye and Atrato rivers in the department of Chocó and perhaps east of the Atrato River, south to the río Sinú (Zuñiga Leal and Defler 2013).<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata coibensis </strong></em><strong><br/></strong>This howler monkey is known only from Coiba Island and neighbouring Jicarón Island, off the Pacific coast of Panama (Milton and Mittermeier 1977, Méndez-Carvajal 2012).<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata trabeata</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>This subspecies is endemic to the Azuero Peninsula, Panama (Froehlich and Froehlich 1987, Rowe 2000, Mendes-Carvajal 2005).</p>",This species is hunted for bushmeat and also live captured for the pet trade.

Urbani, unpubl. data)). They visit flooded forests when fruit productivity is high (Stevenson <em>et al. </em>2000), and the highest densities seem to be found in places where both terra firme and flooded varzeas co-occur (Ahumada <em>et al.</em> 1998), but it has not been found in the floodplains near the Amazon river.<br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata (Stevenson and Quiñones 1993), and populations in western Amazonia frequently visit specific areas in the forest ground (mineral licks) where they feed of soil (Link <em>et al. </em>2011; Link and Di Fiore 2013). When travelling, they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on ripe and fleshy fruits, which comprise approximately 80% of their diet (Stevenson <em>et al.</em> 2000), consuming preferentially common plants and fruits rich in lipids (Stevenson and Link 2010). They feed mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988, Stevenson and Quiñones 1993, Di Fiore <em>et al. </em>2008). The spider monkeys respond to seasonal periods of fruit scarcity by concentrating at places in the forest with high fruit supply (Mourthé 2014). Additionally, they complement their diet with young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage) (Stevenson<em> et al</em>. 2000, Stevenson 2005), and less often with young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, decaying wood, honey, and very occasionally small insects such as caterpillars (Link 2003, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Mourthé 2012). They play a significant role as seed dispersers, as they swallow seeds from hundreds of species of different trees and lianas (Suarez 2006, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008) and disperse them away from parental sources (Link and Di Fiore 2006). The absence of these primates and other atelines can reduce plant diversity in seedlings and saplings (Stevenson 2011). The population decline of spider monkeys can have negative effects in the forest dynamics in the absence of other large seed dispersers (Pacheco and Simonetti 2000).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 15-55 individuals (for review see Shimooka <em>et al. </em>2008). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition (McFarland Symington 1990, Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 1998) that show a high degree of fission fusion dynamics (<em>sensu </em>Aureli <em>et al.</em> 2008). Each female in the group has a core area of the group’s home range which she uses most (Symington 1987, Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data), while males use the group´s home range more evenly. Subgroup size is most frequently of 1 to 4 individuals (Klein and Klein 1976, Link and Di Fiore 2013, Mourthé and Barnett 2014), and only rarely will the entire group coalesce in a single area. Home ranges vary from 150 ha in Tinigua Park, in Colombia and in El Caura basin, in Venezuela, to over 400 ha at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in eastern Ecuador (Castellanos 1997,,Spehar <em>et al.</em> 2010; Link <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Field studies of the behaviour and ecology of this species have been carried out by Izawa <em>et al.</em> (1979), Klein and Klein (1975, 1976, 1977), Ahumada (1989, 1992), Ahumada <em>et al</em>. (1998), Stevenson <em>et al.</em> (1998, 2000), and Link <em>et al. </em>(2006) in La Macarena, Colombia; by Nunes (1988, 1995, 1998),&#160; Mourthé (2011, 2012 2014) and Mourthé and Barnett (2014) at Maracá Ecological Station, Brazil; by Pozo (2001, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c), Suarez (2006), Spehar <em>et al.</em> (2010), Link and Di Fiore (2006), and Di Fiore<em> et al.</em> (2009) in the Yasuní National Park, Ecuador. Additionally, Castellanos (1995, 1997; Castellanos and Chanin 1996) studied the feeding ecology of <em>Ateles belzebuth </em>along the middle and lower reaches of the Río Tawadu, a tributary of the Río Nichare, a tributary of the Rio Caura. Since 2005, Link and Di Fiore (2013 and refs therein) have studied the behavioral ecology and social behavior of white bellied spider monkeys continuously at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station (TBS) in Ecuador.<br/><br/>Six estimated birth dates given by Klein (1971) for <em>A. belzebuth</em>, were spread throughout the year (December, January, April, September, October and November). Nonetheless, in more than 30 births recorded at TBS, Ecuador, births have been restricted to the period between May and December suggesting some reproductive seasonality (Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data). Spider monkeys have been suggested to reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1972) but recent studies have found that females leave their natal groups after 6 years of age and do not give birth until after 2–3 years of being in their new groups. Thus, age at first reproduction for females may well be around 7 to 9 years of age (Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with interbirth cycles that range between 32 and 36 months. Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/><br/><strong>Size</strong><br/>H&amp;B 46-50 cm; TL 74-81 cm (Defler 2003)<br/><br/>Adult male weight mean 8.3 kg (n=10), adult female weight mean 7.9 kg (Smith and Jungers 1997).<br/>Adult male weight 7.3-9.8 kg (mean 8.5 kg, n=12), adult female weight 5.8-10.4 kg (mean 8.1 kg, n=15) (Ford and Davis 1992).","The major threats to <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> are hunting for food, associated live capture for the local pet trade, and habitat loss.<br/><br/>Defler (2003, 2004) considers this species to be among the most endangered of the Colombian Amazonian primates, its range being coincident with the most heavily colonized parts of the region, where its populations are threatened by settlements and commercial development, farming, ranching, timber harvesting, hunting and live capture as pets. In south-central Colombia, particularly in eastern parts of the sub-montane forests and foothills of the Andes, habitat loss is due largely to the expansion of coca plantations (Davalos <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Peruvian Amazon, the principal threat to <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> in lowland forests is hunting, while montane forest populations are susceptible to ‘accelerated deforestation and the loss of habitats for agriculture, cattle ranching and extraction of forest resources’ (Aquino <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; Surveys conducted at the close of the last century did not encounter this species in large areas of its presumed range, indicating that a number of populations had already been extirpated (Aquino and Encarnación 1994). More recent surveys (Shanee 2012; Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015; Aquino <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2016, 2018) identify the species as one of the most commonly hunted Peruvian primates, its hunting frequently associated with illegal logging activities and resulting in population extirpations, even within private protected areas. The expansion of coca plantations and mining (Bax and Francesconi 2018, Bax <em>et al</em>. 2019) contribute significantly to deforestation and habitat fragmentation within this species’ range. Llactayo <em>et al</em>. (2013a, 2013b) report annual deforestation rates in the states of San Martín and Loreto of 30,000 ha and 35,000 ha, respectively, and report that these are likely to increase.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, this species remains heavily hunted and rare near human settlements (Tirira 2007, Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2018). According to a report of the Ministry of the Environment (2014), the Amazonian provinces where this species occurs have the highest deforestation rates in the country. A study in Yasuní carried out by Suarez <em>et al</em>. (2013) documented a trend of decreasing population density of this species in moderately disturbed areas and its extirpation in highly disturbed areas. In addition, several mining concessions will commence operations within the species’ range in southeastern Ecuador in the near future (S. de la Torre, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Where it occurs in Brazilian Amazonia, <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> is a preferred target for both indigenous and non-indigenous populations (Peres 1990, 2000). Based on surveys of more than 100 sites between 1987 and 2005, in areas where this species&#160; is heavily hunted, population densities are reported to have declined by as much as 50% (Peres and Palacios 2007). Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. (2006) project that close to 100 mammal species in Brazilian Amazonia will lose more than 40% of their tropical forest habitat within protected areas and as much as 80% outside of those areas by the year 2050 due to the expansion of cattle and soy industries, and the construction of all-weather highways into the region’s core. This projection covers a period of approximately 45 years (three spider monkey generations) and is based upon assumptions that the current rates of deforestation and highway construction will continue, compliance with legislation requiring forest reserves on private land will remain low, and new protected areas will not be created. <br/><br/>Of the 28 protected areas located in the five countries in which this species is known or believed to occur, only one has been established within the present century.","In western Amazonia, White-bellied Spider Monkeys have large home ranges (150-400 ha) with only little overlap (20-30%) between them (Klein and Klein 1976, Di Fiore and Campbell 2007, Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data). Given that groups comprise of 20 to 40 individuals, population densities tend to be relatively low. In fact, Derby (2008) estimated population densities for <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> as 6.8 and 7.8 individuals/km²&#160;at Yasuni National Park and Tiputini Biodiversity Station, respectively.<br/><br/>The species is still common within protected areas. Klein and Klein (1976) estimated a population density of 15 to 18 individuals/km² in La Macarena, Colombia and 11.5 individuals/km² in the Parque Nacional Yasuní, in Equador (Dew 2005). In Brazil, population estimates are based on studies carried out at the Estação Ecológica de Maracá, reaching 5.5 to 10 individuals/km² (Mendes Pontes 2004). Nunes<em> et al</em>. (1998) reported 34 individuals/km² based on a small study in a relatively confined area. <em>Ateles</em> population densities in various species and study sites are discussed by McFarland Symington (1988), who concluded that the main factors that determine population densities involve the abundance and productivity of certain key plant resources. Nonetheless, given their large body size, spider monkeys are preferred hunting targets for several indigenous communities (Franzen 2006) and thus populations rapidly decline where hunted. For instance, in the north of Peru Aquino <em>et al. </em>(2013) reported 15.5 to 16.5 individuals/km² in areas with moderate to low hunting pressure, but only 1.5 individuals/km² in areas subjected to high hunting pressure. Population densities in the Reserva Nacional Pacaya Samiria in Peru were also as low with only 1 individual/km² (Aquino and Bodmer 2006).",Decreasing,"The geographic distribution of <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> includes the lowland forests (generally below 1,000 m asl) of western Amazonia in Colombia, Ecuador, and Perú, northern Amazonia in southern Venezuela, and northwestern Brazil, reaching east as far as the Rio Branco. The distribution of this species is not well known, and defies an easy description. There are at least three discontinuous areas of occurrence of White Bellied Spider Monkeys: [1] north-western Amazonian rainforests in Colombia; [2] western Amazonian populations in eastern Ecuador (south of the Río Napo) and northwestern Perú; and [3] those populations living in the easternmost part of the distribution in Venezuela and northwestern Brazil. At least in the last case, such gaps could be partly explained by the occurrence of savannas (a habitat formed by low and sparsely distributed shrubs) that are not used by spider monkeys.<br/><br/>In Colombia, Defler (2003, 2004) reported that the taxon was recorded in the piedmont and Cordillera Oriental as far north as the Río Upía drainage in the department of Boyacá. However, a population was recently discovered west of Yopal, at 1,100 m asl in a forest patch from 1,000 to 1,800 m asl (A. Barrera pers. comm). It occurs in the region of the Sierra de La Macarena, eastern Caquetá and the Coehmaní rapids in the South East of the department of Caquetá. It is rare west of the Río Yarí. It was reported from the upper Río Mesay, opposite of the mouth of the Río Pirá-Paraná on the right bank of the Río Apaporis, and on the lower right bank of the Río Apaporis at a salado (clay-lick) site near the Estrella rapids (Defler 2003, 2004). According to Defler (2003, 2004), there is no evidence for its occurrence between the Ríos Caquetá and Putumayo, except on the most western, upper reaches. <em>Ateles belzebuth </em>extends south along the piedmont into Ecuador, but is evidently absent south of the middle and lower Putumayo (Province of Sucumbíos) and is restricted to the South of Río Napo (De la Torre 2000, Tirira 2007). From there it occurs throughout the Ecuadorian Amazon into northern Peru. The distribution map of Aquino and Encarnación (1994, p.120) shows the occurrence of <em>A. belzebuth</em> throughout northern Peru, between Río Putumayo and Río Amazonas, along the left bank of the Río Ucayali, including the basins of the Ríos Napo, Tigre, Marañón, Pastaza, Pacaya and Samiria, and south as far as the Río Cushabatay, a tributary of the Río Ucayali (with <em>Ateles chamek</em> replacing it south of the Cushabatay). The range in Peru extends through the Putumayo/Napo interfluvium up to the Ecuadorian border, but it seems to end near the mouth of the Río Aguarico, not extending into Ecuador (Tirira 2007). Its occurrence between Putumayo and Amazonas Rivers in Peru would indicate that it occurs in the Colombian Trapezium, but this still warrants confirmation (Defler 2003, 2004). In Brazil, <em>Ateles belzebuth </em>occurs throughout the region north of the Rio Negro and west of the right bank of the Rio Branco in Roraima, extending into Venezuela north towards the Río Orinoco (limited by the llanos/forest interface) and in the East to the left bank of the Río Caura (Bodini and Pérez-Hernández 1987). Although widely distributed in Brazil, the species does not occur continuously, being absent or very rare in large areas of campina and campinarana habitats in the westernmost part of the state of Amazonas and in the savannas in the Northeast of the state of Roraima. It seems there are no known localities which connect the Brazilian/Venezuelan populations with those of south-western Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru. The occurrence of this species between the Ríos Putumayo and Amazonas-Napo requires further field research. The species has been observed at altitudes up to 1,300 m on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Oriental (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976).",<em>Ateles belzebuth</em> is used as food by humans and as pets.,Terrestrial,"This species is confirmed, or may occur, in a number of  protected areas:<br/><br/>Brazil:<br/><ul><li>Pico da Neblina National Park (2,298,154 ha)</li><li>Maracá Ecological Station (103,995 ha) (Nunes <em>et al</em>. 1988))</li><li>Juamí-Japurá Ecological Station (832,078 ha) (in range)</li><li>Serra da Mocidade National Park (373,130 ha) (in range)</li><li>Niquiá Ecological Station (282,830 ha) (in range)</li><li>Amazonas National Forest (1,573,100 ha) (in range)</li><li>Caracaraí Ecological Station (Ravetta 2008)</li><li>Roraima National Forest (2,664,685 ha) (in range)</li></ul><br/>Colombia:<br/><ul><li>Cordillera de los Picachos Natural National Park (286,600 ha) (Defler 2004)</li><li>La Paya Natural National Park (442,000 ha) (reported by interview Palanco-Ochoa <em>et al.</em> 1999)</li><li>Tinigua Natural National Park (201,875 ha) (Ahumada 1989, 1992; Stevenson <em>et al. </em>2000)</li><li>Serranía de la Macarena Natural National Park (630,000 ha) (Klein and Klein 1976)</li><li>Nukak Natural National Reserve (855,000 ha) (in range: Defler 2004)</li><li>There is potential occurrence of <em>A. belzebuth</em> in the following parks (Defler 2004): </li><li>Puinawai Natural National Reserve (1,092,500 ha)</li><li>Cahuinarí Natural National Park (575,500 ha)</li><li>Serrania de Chiribiquete Natural National Park (1,280,000 ha)</li></ul><br/>Ecuador <br/>Podocarpus National Park (146,280 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/>Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park (205,249 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/>Yasuní National Park (982,300 ha) (Pozo 2001; Tirira 2007)<br/>Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserve (403,100 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/>Cofán-Bermejo Ecological Reserve (55,451 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/><br/>Peru <br/>Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (2,080,000 ha) (in range: Aquino and Encarnación 1994a).

Although they can be found in anthropogenically-disturbed forests, it is suggested that, in general, spider monkeys are highly susceptible to habitat degradation and often fail to persist in smaller forest fragments (Ramos-Fernández and Wallace 2008, and references therein).In general, <em>A. geoffroyi</em> individuals spend a large amount of their time feeding (~33.5-44%), followed by traveling (~32.6-34%), resting (~12-24.1%) and engaged in other activities (~9.8-10%) (Chapman<em> et al</em>. 1989, Chaves <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, they are able to adjust their activity patterns to overcome the effects of food scarcity in forest fragments and seasonality (Chaves <em>et al.</em> 2011).Spider monkey diets are highly biased towards the consumption of fruit, particularly ripe fruits, and for <em>A. geoffroyi</em> the percentage of fruit consumption in their diets has been reported to vary between 55% and 82% (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2008). Other food items include leaves, flowers, invertebrates, etc. and although they obtain water from food items they may also drink water directly from tree holes, bromeliads, streams and other terrestrial water sources (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2008).Spider monkeys live in multi-male/multi-female groups that exhibit a fission–fusion social organization, in which the members of a large stable group separate on a daily basis in small subgroups of changing sizes and composition (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2010). This type of social organization combined with their arboreal habits and fast movements make their observations quite difficult. Only a few studies have been able to quantify the size and composition of <em>A. geoffroyi</em> in the wild, with group sizes varying from 16 to 56 individuals, and a female/male sex ration of 0.8 to to 4.4 (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2010 and references therein). Group home ranges vary greatly between sites from 95 ha in Yucatan, Mexico to 962 ha in Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Wallace 2008).Average weight for adult males is 8.21 kg, ranging from 7.42 to 9 kg, and for females 7.7 kg, ranging from 6 to 9.4 kg (Ford and Davis 1992).Behavioral and ecological field studies have been carried out mostly in Costa Rica and Panama (see recent reviews on different aspects of their behavior in Campbell 2008).","The major threats to this species are intense habitat loss, habitat degradation due to selective logging of trees of important dietary value, and overexploitation for pet trade (Estrada<em> et al.</em> 2006, Ramos-Fernandez and Wallace 2008). Given the relatively late sexual maturation, single births and long interbirth intervals of spider monkeys, threats to the habitat or directly to the monkey populations produce a stronger negative impact to the overall survival of wild populations (Ramos-Fernandez and Wallace 2008).","Population density of <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> varies considerably among populations and across its distribution range. In Mexico (Chiapas, Campeche and Quintana Roo) reported densities vary between 6.3 and 89.5 ind./km², in Guatemala from 28 to 56.4 ind./km<sup>2</sup>, in Panama 2.1 to 2.3 ind./km<sup>2</sup> (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2010). For Costa Rica densities of 68.5 ind./km² were reported in Corcovado National Park by Weghorst (2007).<br/><br/>A population reduction of greater than 50% is suspected over the course of 45 years (three generations), including the current (2018-2033) and two subsequent generations (2033-2063).&#160;This is based upon Global Forest Watch data for regions of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia in which the species currently occurs.&#160; The data suggests that, should forest loss continue at the same rate that has impacted the previous generation (2004-2018), more than a third (34%) of this species’ forest habitat is likely to be lost by the year 2063. Combined with even light hunting for bushmeat and the pet trade, to which this large-bodied primate is particularly susceptible, these threats push&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi&#160;</em>above the threshold for Endangered.",Decreasing,"<em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> occurs in the Mexican sates of Veracruz, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo, extending south to Guatemala and Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. There are six recognized subspecies: <em>A. g. geoffroyi</em>, <em>A. g. azuerensis</em>, <em>A. g. frontatus</em>, <em>A. g. grisescens</em>, <em>A. g. ornatus</em> and <em>A. g. vellerosus</em>.<br/><br/>According to Kellogg and Goldman (1944) <em>Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi</em> is distributed in the coastal region around San Juan del Norte or Martina Bay in southeastern Nicaragua, extending across the lowlands to the vicinity of Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua on the Pacific coast. It possibly extends into northern Costa Rica, although the true distribution of this species is unknown. Specimens examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from Managua, Nicaragua.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis</em> occurs only in the forested mountains of the Azuero peninsula. Mendez-Carvajal (2013) surveyed the area and reported <em>A. g. azuerensis</em> remaining in the wild in the provinces of Veraguas and Los Santos, but already extinct in the province of Herrera.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi frontatus</em> is believed to range through northwestern Costa Rica and extreme western and northern Nicaragua (Kellogg and Goldman 1944). Specimens from Nicaragua examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from the following localities: Lavala; Peña Blanca; Río Siquia; Río Yoya, a tributary of the Río Princapolca; Tuma and Uluce. Allen (1908, 1910) recorded <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> from the east slope of the Nicaraguan highlands, Savala (800 ft), Tuma (1,000 ft), Peña Blanca (high point in low Atlantic coast forests, 1,500 ft) and Uluce (about 1,000 ft), and in the highlands of northern Nicaragua at Matagalpa (2,000 ft). Morales-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> (2015) reported that individuals from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica and those from central and eastern Nicaragua form a monophyletic clade, corresponding to this subspecies. It is possible that individuals from El Salvador also belong to this subspecies, or to a distinct and previously unidentified subspecies (Morales-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2015).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi grisescens</em> is a subspecies of doubtful validity. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) presumed that it occurred in the valley of the Río Tuyra extending south-east through the Serranía del Sapo of extreme south-eastern Panama and the Cordillera de Baudó of north-western Colombia. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) indicated that grisescens occurs in Colombia: “…[it] is known only from the vicinity of Juradó very near the Panamanian border on the Pacific coast. It is undoubtedly restricted by the Baudó Mountains to a narrow coastal strip that may extend as far south as Cabo Corrientes.” (p.66), but Defler <em>et al</em>. (2003) mentioned that there are no observations to confirm its presence in Colombia.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi ornatus</em> is found in Panama, to the east of the Canal Zone, and to the west through the Chiriquí province to central/western Costa Rica. Heltne and Kunkel (1975) proposed that the eastern limits of this subspecies were in San Juan, Cerro Brujo, Cerro Azul and Río Pequeñi — all within the Madden Lake watershed, about 30 miles east of the Panama Canal. The limits of this subspecies in Costa Rica are not well known, but it is believed that this species occurs in the Osa Peninsula, Corcovado National Park and Carara Biological Reserve (Matamoros and Seal 2001). The population on Barro Colorado Island was introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, and it is unknown whether they belonged to a single subspecies (see Milton and Hopkins 2006).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus </em>occurs in southern Veracruz, eastern Oaxaca, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, and Qunitana Roo in Mexico, and to the south through Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Originally, Kellogg and Goldman (1944) considered <em>A. g. pan</em> and <em>A. g. yucatanensis</em> as distinct taxa, but morphological analyses by Silva-López <em>et al</em>. (1996) and recent molecular work by Morales-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2015) show that individuals within this range belong to a single (though morphologically variable) taxon.","Being one of the largest Neotropical primates, <em>Ateles </em>is commonly hunted as a source of food by local people (e.g., Peres 1990; Ramos-Fernandez &amp; Wallace 2008; Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, reports on <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> currently hunted for that purpose are scarce, as it seems to only occur occasionally in Mesoamerica (Carrillo <em>et al.</em> 2000). However, <em>Ateles </em>heavily trafficked for pet trade. Duarte-Quiroga and Estrada (2003) reported spider monkeys as the most common primate pet in Mexico City accounting for 67% (out of the 179 cases reported). Although it is common to find spider monkeys as pets in Mesoamerica there is no accurate information on the extent of the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"Despite of intense deforestation observed in Mesoamerica, with more than 70% of the original forest cover lost as a result of human activity (Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2006), the region counts with over 400 officially recognized protected areas within the distribution range of <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em>. However, many of these areas suffer several problems including lack of actual protection, limited number of staff, small size, poor delimitation, and isolation due to high deforestation rates in surrounding areas (Estrada <em>et al.</em> 2006). Among the largest extensions of protected forest where <em>A. geoffroyi </em>lives are the Mayan Forest, located on the borders of Mexico, Guatemala and Belize, La Mosquitia, which is located in both Honduras and Nicaragua, the Indio Maiz-Tortuguero, which includes a group of reserves and indigenous territories in Nicaragua and Tortuguero National Park in Costa Rica, and La Amistad International Park, a World Heritage Site located along the Talamanca mountain range of Costa Rica and Panama.<br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II (except for <em>A. g. frontatus</em> and <em>A. g. ornatus</em>, which are listed on Appendix I).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

However, it remains relatively common within its range, and is able to persist in slightly modified habitats. Nonetheless, there may be localized declines taking place due to ongoing habitat loss. In Panama, the species is frequently hunted and captured for the pet trade (Méndez-Carvajal 1999, Rasmussen <em>et al. </em>2002). There have been attempts to introduce this species by local people in the Veraguas Province, including western Azuero, but with unsuccessful results. <em>Saguinus geoffroyi</em> is often road killed in areas near Parque Nacional Metropolitano (Méndez-Carvajal 2001), and Parque Nacional Soberanía (Méndez-Carvajal 2001).

Barbosa <em>et al</em>. (1988, in Mast et al. 1993) also recorded the species at Quibdo, a town just east of the upper Río Atrato. In discussing habitat preference in Panama, Moynihan (1970) stated that rufous-napped tamarins are abundant in some parts of the Pacific coastal region, and also occur in some central areas approximately equidistant from both coasts. However, they are completely absent from the whole of the Atlantic coast of the isthmus, except for one small, highly modified or “unnatural” area. The exception he mentioned is around the Canal Zone, the city of Colón, and Lake Gatún where the original forest has been almost entirely destroyed, and Moynihan (1970, 1976) argued that their occurrence there is the result of a recent range extension. The map of localities provided by Hershkovitz (1977, p.915) confirms Moynihan’s observation, with only two records on the Atlantic side of the isthmus except in the vicinity of the Canal Zone. The two outlying Atlantic coast records listed in the gazetteer (p.925) are: Locality 6c, San Blas, Mandinga, 9º27'N, 79º04'W, C. O.

Handley, Jr. February-March 1963, a series of 12 specimens, also in the US National Museum. Moynihan (1970, 1976) suggested that their absence from the Atlantic coast was related to a preference for drier forests (“of moderate humidity”) typical of the Pacific coast.

Associated with their tree-gouging and gum-feeding specialisation, groups generally have small home ranges: 1.25 ha to 4.5 ha (Fonseca and Lacher Jr. 1984); 3.5 ha (Faria 1986, 1989); 8.25 ha and 18.5 ha in IBGE Ecological Station (Brasília) (Miranda and Faria 1997); 2.5 ha and 6 ha in Universidade Católica de Goiás (Goiás) (Santana and Santee 1999);&#160; 6.0 ha in Universidade Católica Dom Bosco (Odalia-Rimoli and Rimoli 2007) and 50 ha in RPPN Fundação Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (Ferreira et al. 2005, Santos, 2014), both in Campo Grande (Mato Grosso do Sul). <br/><br/><em>Callithrix penicillata</em> has been the subject of a number of short studies (see, for example, Fonseca and Lacher Jr. 1984; Lacher Jr. <em>et al.</em> 1984; Faria 1984a,b, 1986, 1989; Miranda and Faria 2001; Vilela and Faria 2004; Vilela 2007).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult female: HB 209mm ± 9.0 (n=9) (Hershkovitz 1977); weight 307 g (n=8) (Smith and Jungers 1997).<br/>Adult male: HB 209mm ± 9.0 (n=9) (Hershkovitz 1977); weight 344 g (n=8) (Smith and Jungers 1997).","This is an adaptable, widespread species, which has been introduced in a number of regions in Brazil (for example, Espírito Santo, Paraná, São Paulo and Santa Catarina), and is considered a competitor, displacing native species. However, as with <em>C. jacchus</em>, although widespread and hardy, and able to survive in extremely degraded habitats, populations of this species have disappeared or are declining in many parts of its range. Threats include deforestation and fragmented habitat, hunting for pets, and hybridisation.","There are estimated to be more than 10,000 mature individuals. Recorded population densities: 0.40 ind/ha and 0.82 ind/ha in IBGE Ecological Reserve, Brasília (Miranda and Faria 1997); 0.43 ind/km in Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais (Stallings and Robinson 1991); 3.2 ind/ha&#160; in Universidade Católica de Goiás (campus II), Goiás (Santana 1999); 0.29 ind/10km in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais (Barros 2008).",Decreasing,"<em>C. penicillata </em>has a very wide distribution, occurring mainly in the Cerrado region of east central Brazil, but can also be found in Atlantic Forest and Caatinga. According to Hershkovitz (1977) and Rylands and Mednes (2008), this species is endemic to Brazil and occurs in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, the Federal District, the south-west tip of Piauí, Maranhão and the north of São Paulo, north of the Rios Tietê and Piracicaba, as a resident and native, and in the states of Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná and Santa Catarina as a resident and introduced. In the north, it would seem that it is restricted to the south of the Rio Grande and Rio São Francisco (<em>C. jacchus </em>occurring to the north of the Rio Grande), although Vivo (1991) identified two skins in the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, from the north-east coast of Maranhão, at Miritiba (now called Humberto de Campos), which he indicated extends its range right through eastern Maranhão, along the left bank of the Rio Parnaiba. The large gap between the next northern most locality to the south (Canabrava, Rio Tocantins, Goiás, locality 275a of Hershkovitz 1977, p.490) and this northern Maranhão locality, indicates that they were probably introduced animals. They were not located by Hershkovitz (1977) and were presumed by him to be <em>C. jacchus,</em> following Ávila-Pires (1969). Silva Jr. (1999) carried out surveys in Maranhão and Piauí and did not report the occurrence of <em>C. penicillata, </em>only <em>C. jacchus. </em>The western limits of its range would seem to be marked by the Rio Araguaia, south from around 8ºS in the region of the Serra das Cordilheiras, extending into the north-east of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, east of the Serra de Maracaju to the level of the Rios Pardo or Taquaraçú, west (right) bank tributaries of the Rio Paraná.<br/><br/>Surveys in the north of the state of Minas Gerais have shown that <em>C. penicillata </em>extends its range through the region between the upper Rio São Francisco and the Rio Jequitinhonha, along the western slopes of the Serra do Espinhaço. <em>C. penicillata </em>occurs both sides of the Rio Jequitinhonha as far east as the Rio Araçuaí, a south (right) bank tributary of the upper Jequitinhonha, beyond which it is restricted to the north of the river, with<em> C. geoffroyi </em>occurring to the south (Rylands <em>et al. </em>1988), the result of a recent introduction (<em>ca. </em>1975) in the vicinity of Belmonte (Coimbra-Filho unpubl. data). <em>Callithrix penicillata</em> is typically of the Cerrado region of Minas Gerais (in the central, south-west, west, and north of the state). Those parts originally covered by Atlantic Forest in the east and south-east (Zona da Mata) are the domain of <em>C. geoffroyi, C. flaviceps, </em>and in part of the Rio Doce valley, <em>C. aurita. </em>However, with the destruction of the forest and also introductions arising from misguided release of confiscated animals,<em> C. penicillata </em>is taking a hold and probably replacing other species in numerous localities east and south of its original range (see, for example, Olmos and Martuscelli 1995). This is happening in the Rio Doce State Park, and is possibly also the case of<em> C. penicillata </em>reported by Vivo (1991; see also Coimbra-Filho 1984) from the Itatiaia National Park straddling the border of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. In both cases,<em> C. aurita </em>is the species naturally occurring in the area.<br/>The current distribution of the taxon is probably reduced in relation to its historical range due to habitat loss, especially in the Cerrado. Its extent of occurrence is greater than 20,000 km² and its area of occupancy greater than 2,000 km².<em><br/><br/></em>",Hunting for pets exists for this species.,Terrestrial,"<em>C. penicillata </em>has been introduced into protected areas in the state of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and São Paulo.

It is very adaptable, being able to live in urban parks and gardens and rural villages where it is not persecuted and has sufficient food. It has been introduced into many areas outside of its natural range, where it is able to thrive and is believed to compete with and displace other (native) marmosets.<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972; Rylands 1994). They live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season.  <br/><br/><em>Callithrix jacchus</em> is a gum-feeding specialist, with gouging lower incisors to excavate holes in gum-producing trees to guarantee gum year-round. This allows it to live in very seasonal habitats, including deciduous forests and scrub in the north-east of Brazil. Associated with its specialisation in gum-feeding, it defends home ranges that are much smaller than are typical of the genus: 0.72 to 5.2 ha. Castro (2003) recorded home ranges of 0.3 to 2.4 ha at Níisia Floresta National Forest, Rio Grande do Norte. Maier <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Alonso and Llangguth (1989) recorded home ranges of 2-5 ha in the urban district of João Pessoa, Paraíba, and Mendes Pontes and Monteiro da Cruz (1995) of 4 ha in an urban park in Recife, Pernambuco. Group sizes have been recorded to range from 2 to 15 at the Tapacurá State Ecological Station, Pernambuco (Hubrecht 1985; Scanlon <em>et al</em>. 1988). Usually one female breeds in each group. Twins are produced twice a year.","Although widespread and common in many localities, and even replacing other <em>Callithrix</em> species where it has been introduced, <em>C. jacchus</em> populations are declining through habitat destruction in many parts of their distribution (Mittermeier<em> et al.</em> 1988; Coimbra-Filho 1984). There is some limited hunting for pets. However, harvesting and the current rate of decline and are not sufficient to qualify it for, or near for, a threatened category.","<em>Callithrix jacchus</em> can occur in very high densities. Total remaining population is not known, but it was estimated that the number of mature individuals of this taxon is greater than 10,000. The groups range in size from 3-15 individuals but usually have an average of nine members (Monteiro da Cruz 1998; Alonso and Langguth 1989): 8.7 ± 2.7 (n=18) (Koenig 1995); 8.5 ± 3.3 (n=4) (Mendes-Pontes and Monteiro da Cruz 1995); 6.4 ± 2.2 (n=10) (Digby and Barreto 1996); 10.6 ± 2.5 (n=7) (Arruda <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/>Density estimates:Ceará: 1 ind./ha – Campus Universitário do Pici (Da Silva 1999);&#160;Rio Grande do Norte: 0.85-1.6 ind./ha –Nísia Floresta National Forest (Castro 2003);&#160;Pernambuco 1.1-1.5 ind./ha – Ipojuca (Verissimo and Oliveira 2007);&#160;Paraíba: 9.5 groups/km2 - RPPN Engenho Gargaú, Santa Rita (Fialho and Gonçalves, 2008).Rio de Janeiro: 0.09 ind./ha – Rio Bonito (Ruiz-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2000).",Decreasing,"The Common Marmoset occurs in the scrub forest (forest patches in dry caatinga thorn scrub) and Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Brazil, in the states of Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Piauí, where it is endemic, originally extending south as far as the Rio São Francisco and its west (left) bank tributary the Rio Grande (about 11º30’S). Hershkovitz (1977) indicated that it also probably extends north-west into the state of Maranhão, to the left bank of the Rio Parnaíba and the Serra do Valentim (Hershkovitz 1977). Hershkovitz (1977) extended&#160; the distribution no further west than the middle reaches of the Rio Grande (left bank) and the upper Rio Parnaíba (right bank), with a lacuna between these points and the Rio Tocantins. Silva Jr. (1999) reported on localities in Maranhão and Piauí marking the north-western limit to its range, and determined that, as Hershkovitz (1977) had indicated, it extends to the left bank of the Rio Parnaíba, but there is a lack of information concerning its occurrence or otherwise west from there into the basin of the Rio Itapecuru (Silva Jr. 1999). Flesher (2001) recorded <em>C. jacchus</em> in the Serra das Mangabeiras at the headwaters of the Rio Parnaíba in Piauí, approximately 10ºS, 46ºW. South of the Serra da Mangabeiras, it is possible that the Serra Geral de Goiás marks the divide with <em>C. penicillata</em> to the west.&#160;<br/>It has spread into numerous other regions as a result of introductions outside of its original range, south of the Rio São Francisco, accompanying the destruction and degradation of the Atlantic coastal forest and its associated ecosystems (Coimbra-Filho and Câmara 1996). Introduced and recent populations include those in the state of Sergipe and the north and north-east of Bahia, including the Recôncavo Baiano (Alonso<em> et al</em>. 1987), the state of Rio de Janeiro (Coimbra-Filho, 1984; Ruiz-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2000) and the Ilha de Santa Catarina in southern Brazil (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2005) and they are also reported to have established themselves in Buenos Aires.

Also known to use cabruca (cacao) plantations which are shaded with some native trees remaining from the original forest. They have been observed in secondary growth forest in abandoned rubber plantations. <em>Callithix kuhlii</em> is an adaptable species well able to live in degraded and secondary forests, depending on sufficient year round food sources and foraging sites. Near the coast, in the cocoa growing region, there is no distinct dry season with rainfall exceeding 2,000 mm per year (the heaviest rains are from March to June), but in the West of their range the forests are mesophytic with a distinct dry season. In some areas of its distribution the forests are semi deciduous, with rainfall as low as 1,000 mm per year (Rylands 1989, Pinto and Rylands 1997).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births.

They live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals. Rylands (1982) observed groups sizes of 5 to 9 individuals (mean 6.56 ± 1.33, n=8). Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. The groups defend home ranges of 10-40 ha, depending on the availability and distribution of food items and secondary-growth patches. Rylands (1982, 1989) recorded a home range size of 12 ha for a group of five individuals.<br/><br/>Rylands (1982, 1984, 1989) studied the behaviour and ecology of <em>C. kuhlii</em>&#160;at the Lemos Maia Experimental Station, Una, Bahia. Raboy and Dietz (2000) and Raboy <em>et al</em>. (2006) also studied this species in the Una Biological Reserve.","The main threat to <em>Callithrix kuhlii</em> is habitat loss and forest fragmentation, mainly due to the conversion of forest areas to cattle ranch and extensive agriculture, especially in the western part of the species range where cattle ranches predominate and forest fragmentation is most severe (Neves 2008, Pereira 2015).&#160; According to Global Forest Watch data, rates of forest loss in both Bahia and Minas Gerais have accelerated in recent years and could result in losses of suitable habitat on the order of 15%-20% deforestation over the course of three generations (2013-2031).&#160; Hybridization with invasive species of <em>Callithrix </em>(<em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em>) represents an increasing menace. The species is also captured for the pet trade and suffers mortality from road accidents and electrocutions.","The total remaining population is not known, but, due to the species' range and its presence in some relatively large protected areas, it is suspected to be more than 10,000 mature individuals (Pereira 2015). Population densities recorded from the Lemos Maia Experimental Station (CEPLAC/CEPEC), Una, Bahia, were 8.70-9.7 groups/km² or 50.00-68.06 individuals/km² (Rylands 1982).<br/><br/>The population is declining. A reduction of at least 30% over three generations (18 years) is suspected based on accelerated forest loss that has impacted the most recent generation (2013-2018) and is likely to result in an overall 20% loss of suitable habitat over the the course of the next two generations (2019-2025; 2026-2031), combined with ongoing capture of this species for the pet trade, and hybridization with at least two other <em>Callithrix</em> species.",Decreasing,"Endemic to Brazil, <em>Callithrix kuhlii</em> occurs between Rio de Contas and Rio Jequitinhonha in southern Bahia, just entering the north-easternmost tip of the state of Minas Gerais (Santos <em>et al</em>. 1987, Rylands<em> et al</em>. 1988, Neves 2008). The western boundary is still uncertain, but undoubtedly related to the inland limits of the Atlantic coastal forest. I.B. Santos (in Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1988) observed hybrids of <em>C. penicillata</em> and <em>C. kuhlii</em> in the region of Almenara, Minas Gerais, on the left bank of the Rio Jequitinhonha (16°41’S, 40°51’W). Neves (2008) surveyed the distribution of <em>C. kuhlii</em> and found individuals with hybrid phenotypes in 13 localities with dense tropical rain forest, at the western boundary of the species range, suggesting that the species is losing area to <em>C. penicillata</em> in this region (Neves 2008, Pereira 2015). Its range is largely coincident with that of the golden-headed lion tamarin <em>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</em> and these two callitrichids are broadly sympatric.<br/>Surveys in 1986/1987 by Oliver and Santos (1991) demonstrated the presence of forms intermediate in appearance between <em>C. kuhlii</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em> north of the Rio de Contas, along the coast up to the regions of Valença and Nazaré, just south of the city of Salvador (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1988). Individuals observed by Rylands near to Nazaré lacked the white frontal blaze, and, although retaining the pale cheek patches typical of <em>kuhlii</em>, were paler grey. A photograph of the marmoset from Valença, Bahia, north of the Rio de Contas, is shown in Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (1988, p.19). The variation in pelage colour of the marmosets in this region is considerable, but Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> (1991/1992) showed that true <em>C. kuhlii</em> extended north through coastal Bahia into the state of Sergipe as far as the Rio São Francisco. The present-day confusion has arisen from the widespread forest destruction, even more intense north of Salvador City, and the introduction and invasion of <em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em>.",Maintaining this species in captivity or semi-captive as pets is common within the species range (Neves 2008).

White-faced marmoset inhabits a great variety of habitats, including dense forest, semideciduous forest of the Atlantic Forest biome and deciduous forest in the Caatinga biome (the northern distribution reachs the Jequitinhonha Valley) (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 1988, Passamani 1996). The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats (Rylands and Mendes 2008a), and is tolerant to changes / disturbances in the environment, occurring in forest fragments immersed in eucalyptus monoculture matrix (Passamani 1996, 1998, Passamani and Rylands 2000a,b). Therefore, it can be considered a species very adapted to antropic environments (Rylands and Mendes 2008a).<br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births.

Although considered an adaptable species, populations are declining because of widespread destruction of the Atlantic forest in the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. Less than 6.8% of the original area of Atlantic forest remains in the state of Minas Gerais (da Fonseca 1985). Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> (1982) and Coimbra-Filho (1986c) recommended that this species be considered endangered, but Oliver and Santos (1991) found that although it was patchily distributed, it remained locally abundant, and concluded that the species is not seriously threatened at the present time. It is occasionally hunted for pets.","Chiarello (1995) recorded a density of 10.5 groups/km² and a total population of about 1,644 individuals in the Linhares Forest Reserve (21,800 ha) of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, in northern Espírito Santo, Brazil. Subsequently, Chiarello (1999) surveyed <em>Callithrix geoffroyi</em> in a number of areas in the state of Espírito Santo. In the Sooretama Biological Reserve (24,250 ha) he recorded encounter rates of 1.81 groups/10 km, and in the Linhares Forest Reserve, 2.16 groups/10 km. Densities were lower in the smaller forests of the Córrego do Veado Biological reserve (2,400 ha) and Córrego Grande Biological Reserve (1,504 ha), at 1.05 groups/10 km and 0.15 groups/10 km, respectively.<br/>The total population size is not known, but it is inferred that the number of mature individuals is greater than 10,000. White-faced marmoset has an average size group ranging from 3 individuals, as observed in Aracruz Celulose SA (ES) by Passamani and Rylands (2000a), to 10 individuals as it was observed in Morro do Pilar (MG) by Oliveira <em>et al. </em>(2003).",Decreasing,"Geoffroy’s Marmoset occurs in the state of Espírito Santo and the forested eastern and north-eastern part of Minas Gerais, north as far as the Rios Jequitinhonha and Araçuaí and south to near the state border of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro (Ávila-Pires 1969, Hershkovitz 1977, Coimbra-Filho 1984, Rylands<em> et al.</em> 1988). The populations just south of the Rio Jequitinhonha resulted from animals released near its mouth, at Belmonte, around 1975 (Coimbra-Filho 1986c). From there it spread eastward, and today also occurs in gallery forests throughout the region of dry thorn scrub (<em>caatinga</em>) of the middle reaches of the river (Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1988). Vivo (1991) limits it to the east of the Serra do Espinhaço in Minas Gerais. It has been recorded from the eastern slopes of Serra do Cipó, a southerly section of the Serra do Espinhaço range, at an altitude of 1,274 m (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hybrid populations of <em>C. penicillata</em> and <em>C. geoffroyi</em> have been observed in some parts of the Serra da Piedade along the Rio Piracicaba, affluent of the upper Rio Doce, where the Atlantic coastal forest gives way to the cerrado (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al</em>. 1993, Passamani <em>et al</em>. 1997). The range of <em>C. geoffroyi</em> overlaps with <em>C. flaviceps</em> (see below) in southern Espírito Santo (south of the Rio Doce) and south-eastern Minas Gerais. However, <em>C. geoffroyi</em> is generally restricted to lowland areas, below 500–700 m, and<em> C. flaviceps</em> to altitudes above 400–500 m (Coimbra-Filho 1971, Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1981). Hershkovitz (1977) asserted that the highest recorded locality for <em>C. geoffroyi</em> is Santa Teresa, 659 m asl, but Mendes (1993, 1997a) has observed mixed bands of <em>C. geoffroyi </em>and <em>C. flaviceps</em> at altitudes of 800 m. Hybrid populations have been recorded for intermediate elevations (Mendes 1993, 1997a). It is urgent to survey some important sites such as the Monte Pascoal National Park, because its occurrence is uncertain in this locality. The extent of occurrence of the species is greater than 20,000 km²&#160;and it seems that its area of occupancy is greater than 2,000km².",,Terrestrial,"<p>This species occurs in a number of protected areas:<br/> <br/> Minas Gerais<br/> Serra do Cipo National Park (33,800 ha), Minas Gerais (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2003)<br/> Fazenda Córrego de Areia Reserve (60 ha) (privately owned)<br/> <br/> Espirito Santo<br/> Córrego Grande Biological Reserve (1,504 ha) (Mendes 1991, Chiarello 1999)<br/> Córrego do Veado Biological Reserve (2,392 ha) (Mendes 1991, Chiarello 1999)<br/> Sooretama Biological Reserve (27,943 ha) (Mendes 1991, Chiarello 1999)<br/> Comboios Biological Reserve (833 ha) (Mendes 1991)<br/> Duas Bocas State Reserve (2,910 ha) (Mendes 1991)<br/> Linhares Forest Reserve (21,787 ha) (Mendes 1991, Chiarello 1999))<br/> Goitacazes Forest Reserve (1,400 ha) (Mendes 1991)<br/> Santa Lucia Biological Station (350 ha) (Mendes 1991)<br/> Fazenda São Joaquim Reserve (Klabin Reserve) (1,505 ha)(Mendes 1991)<br/> Its occurrence in the Monte Pascoal National Park is in some doubt, and Oliver and Santos (1991) reported that <em>C. jacchus</em> had possibly been introduced there.<br/> <br/><br/> Bahia<br/> Porto Seguro Forest Reserve (6,069 ha)<br/> Pau Brasil Experimental Station (900 ha)<br/> Gregório Bondar Experimental Station (710 ha)</p>  <p><br/> Santa Catarina<br/> Córrego Grande Ecological Park (21,3 ha) (Zago<em> et al.</em> 2007).</p>  <p><br/> This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
17936805,3571,Callithrix flaviceps,Critically Endangered,A2ace,2020,2019-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Callithrix flaviceps</em> is considered Critically Endangered (CR A2ae) due a suspected population reduction experienced over the last three generations (18 years), due in large part to declining habitat, the effects of introduced conspecifics (e.g., hybridization) and a yellow fever epidemic reportedly reducing at least one of the more significant subpopulations by 90%. In addition,&#160;the total population is estimated at 4,440 individuals, with the total number of mature individuals below 2,500. It is unlikely that any subpopulation possesses more than 250 mature individuals.","<em>Callithrix aurita </em>and <em>C. flaviceps </em>are the southernmost forms of marmosets in terms of the natural range of the genus (<em>C. jacchus, C. penicillata </em>and <em>C. geoffroyi </em>have been introduced further south in Paraná, São Paulo, Santa Catarina and Argentina). They occur in the montane Atlantic coastal forest and forests of the inland plateau, at altitudes up to 1,200 m where dry season temperatures can fall close to freezing (Ferrari <em>et al. </em>1996). They show a preference for disturbed forest, being rare in old growth forest with sparse understoreys (Ferrari 1988; Ferrari and Mendes 1991). There is a natural hybrid zone, with <em>Callithrix aurita, </em>at the Serra do Brigadeiro, Carangola, in south-eastern Minas Gerais (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al. </em>1993; Cosenza 1993; Mendes 1997a; Cosenza and Melo 1998).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex), fungi and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects) (see Ferrari 1988, 1991; Corrêa<em> et al. </em>2000; Hilário and Ferrari 2010a). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of their diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972; Rylands 1984). Nevertheless, <em>C. flaviceps </em>rarely gouge trees in order to stimulate exudate production and feed primarily on exudates already available in the environment (Ferrari 1991; Hilário and Ferrari 2010a). They live in extended family groups of 3 to 20 individuals (Alves 1986; Ferrari 1991; Ferrari and Digby 1996; Guimarães 1998; Hilário and Ferrari 2010a). Reproduction is concentrated at one dominant female, although up to four females can reproduce simultaneously in on group (Ferrari 1991; Guiarães 1998; Hilário and Ferrari 2010b).<em> C. flaviceps </em>groups present weak territoriality and occupy large home ranges (33.9 -138.3 ha) compared to other congeneric species (Ferrari 1991; Guiarães 1998; Hilário 2009).<br/><br/>The ecology and behaviour of <em>C. flaviceps </em>has been studied by Ferrari (1988, 1991, Ferrari and Diego 1992) at the 880 ha Caratinga Biological Station in Minas Gerais. The home range of the group he studied was 35.5 ha. Guimarães (1998a, 1998b) also studied the same marmoset group at Caratinga. Latter, Hilário (2009, Hilário and Ferrari 2010a) studied the ecology and behavior of a free ranging group at the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (3,589 ha) in Espírito Santo.<br/><br/>The dentition of <em>Callithrix flaviceps </em>is less specialized for tree-gouging to obtain gum than it is in <em>C. jacchus </em>and <em>C. penicillata </em>(see Natori 1986). Nevertheless, at Caratinga Biological Station gum is an important part of the diet year round, and largely obtained from sites where it is available without requiring gouging (Ferrari 1988, 1991; Ferrari<em> et al. </em>1996). At Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, however, <em>C. flaviceps </em>feeds predominantly on fungi and small animals, with gum representing only 3% of the group’s diet (Hilário and Ferrari 2010a).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Average weight: 406 g (Rosenberger 1992).","<em>Callithrix flaviceps </em>has a restricted range in an area where the forest is extremely fragmented due to expanding agriculture, cattle ranching, tree plantations (Eucalyptus), urbanization, mining and dam construction (Coimbra-Filho 1986a; 1990; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Mendes and Melo 2007; pers. obs.). The species is also captured live for the local&#160; pet trade.<br/><br/>Mendes and Melo (2007) surveyed forest fragments in the Zona da Mata of the state of Minas Gerais, and recorded the presence of introduced populations of <em>Callithrix jacchus</em>, <em>C. peniciilata</em> and <em>C. geoffroyi</em>, which they believe are displacing <em>C. flaviceps</em>. They recommended awareness campaigns to reduce the habit of releasing marmosets in the forests surrounding the town of Manhuaçú.<br/>Comparison of census data spanning three generations (2005-2019), a yellow fever epidemic appears to be largely responsible for a 90% population decline in at least one major sub-population (Possamai <em>et al</em>. 2019) and may have impacted others as well (S. Mendes, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><strong><em></em></strong>","Their distribution is locally patchy, being abundant in some areas, but rare or absent in others close by. A past population decline of at least 90% is suspected due habitat degradation, extraction for the pet trade, and yellow fever.<br/><br/>In Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, Espírito Santo, Pinto<em> et al. </em>(1993) recorded a mean density of 7.1 individuals/km² (range = 3.4-18 individuals/km²) and Hilário (2009) recorded a density of 15.4 individuals/km². At the Caratinga Biological Station, Minas Gerais, the recorded densities were 40 individuals/km² (Ferrari 1988) and 13 individuals/km2 (Almeida-Silva <em>et al. </em>2005). In a conservative approach using the smallest density reported for the species, we estimate a total population of 4,440, consisting of less than 2,500 mature individuals (ICMBio 2018). Considering the highly fragmented landscape in which <em>C. flaviceps </em>occurs, it is also unlikely that any subpopulation possesses more than 250 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A recent survey data from RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala (Possamai <em>et al</em>. 2019) documents a 90% population decline since 2005, due in large part to a yellow fever epidemic. This may be the case throughout the species' range. In addition, habitat loss is occurring across the species range and it is extracted from the wild for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"The distribution of <em>Callithrix flaviceps</em> is described by Hershkovitz (1977), Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> (1981), and Coimbra-Filho (1986a). It occurs in the Serra da Mantiqueira in southern Espírito Santo, south of the Rio Doce at least to the state boundary with Rio de Janeiro (and in the past possibly in the north of the state of Rio de Janeiro, in the municipalities of Natividade, Porciuncula and the north of Bom Jesus do Itabapoãna when they were forested). It extends west into eastern Minas Gerais in scattered localities in the highly fragmented forests of the Rio Manhuaçu basin as far as Manhuaçú (40°02’W), as noted by Coimbra-Filho (1986a) Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> (1981) and Mendes and Melo (2007). Ferrari and Mendes (1991) and Mendes (1993) reviewed the distribution of <em>C. flaviceps</em>. Hirsch (2003) obtained records in Minas Gerais which have extended its known range somewhat north and west, towards the east (right bank) of the Rio Doce (Fazenda Saet [19º43'S, 42º26'] and the Fazenda do Eraldo A. Alves [19º45'S, 42º25'] both at an altitiude of 270 m and about 10 km from the east bank of the Rio Doce, in the municipality of Pingo d’Água). Hirsch (2003) also refers to two localities which would extend the range a little further south in Minas Gerais, but they have still to be confirmed and may be hybrids with <em>C. aurita</em> (the left bank of the Rio Matipó, municipality of Abre Campo, and the Córrego Jurumirim, left bank of the Rio Casca, municipality of Rio Casca).<br/><br/>In 2011 an individual of <em>C. flaviceps</em> was collected at the municipality of Varre-Sai, in the northernmost part of the state of Rio de Janeiro. However, a larger investigation is necessary to confirm the presence of the species in this state (Oliveira and Grelle 2012).<br/><br/>It is suspected that both extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for this species are in decline due habitat degradation.",This species is live captured for the pet trade.,Terrestrial,"This species occurs in the following protected areas:<br/><br/>Minas Gerais<br/>Caparaó National Park (31,853 ha) (part Espírito Santo)<br/>Caratinga Biological Station / RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala (900 ha) (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1981).<br/>RPPN Mata do Sossego Biological Station (221 ha) (privately owned)<br/><br/>Espírito Santo<br/>Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (4,492 ha) (Pinto <em>et al</em>. 1993)<br/>Pedra Azul State Reserve (993 ha) (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)<br/>Forno Grande State Reserve (340 ha) (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)<br/>São Lourenço Biological Station (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)  <br/>Santa Lucia Biological Station (350 ha) (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)<br/>Montes Verdes Florest Reserve (1500 ha)(privately owned) (Mendes 1991).<br/><br/>Attempts to establish a captive breeding program have to date been unsuccessful (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species appears to be only sparsely distributed over its known range, which includes four of the world's top seven countries in terms of current rates of tropical forest loss: Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. In addition, presence/absence surveys suggest that it is sympatric in 12% or less of tropical sites surveyed for other Neotropical mammals.&#160; Furthermore, less than half of the forests in which <em>Callimico</em> is found are protected.&#160; Increased forest loss within this species' range is likely to be driven by human population expansion, road construction projects, slash-and-burn agriculture, timber harvesting and artisanal gold mining.","<p> Occurs in forest mixed with bamboo, and in&#160;varillales&#160;(large stands of thin, straight trees).&#160;Izawa (1979), Buchanan-Smith (1991a), and Ferrari&#160;et al.&#160;(1999) have indicated that it is a habitat specialist concentrating on bamboo forests and disturbed forests (secondary growth) related to their tendency to spend much of their time in the lowest parts the forest&#160;understorey&#160;in dense vegetation. They can also be found in more open, mature forest (Christen and&#160;Geissmann&#160;1994; Christen 1998, 1999). Porter (2007) quantified the time a group spent in different habitat types during the course of a year: primary forest with dense&#160;understorey&#160;76%; bamboo forest 10%; secondary forest 3%. The group used bamboo forest more than the sympatric tamarins&#160;(<em>L.&#160;fuscicollis&#160;and&#160;S.&#160;labiatus</em>). Its preference for dense vegetation is related to the extraordinary inclusion of fungi in its diet and to its insect foraging&#160;behaviour. Bamboo, stream edge, and tree falls are where they are able to find the jelly fungi and bamboo fungi that they appreciate (Pook&#160;and&#160;Pook&#160;1981; Porter and Christen 2002; Porter, 2007; Porter&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).&#160;<br/> <br/> The diet of&#160;<em>Callimico&#160;</em>includes fruit, arthropods (especially&#160;orthopterans&#160;and stick insects), fungi, and exudates. Porter (2007; Porter and Christen 2002; see also Hanson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) found that fungi were an essential and considerable component of the diet. Two types were eaten: jelly fungi (<em>Auricularia</em>, 3 species) and bamboo fungi (<em>Ascopolyporous</em>, 2 species). In some months (May-July, dry season) fungi accounted for 48-63% of the feeding records.&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;forages for arthropods in the understorey&#160;and beneath the leaf litter on the forest floor. They are&#160;understorey&#160;specialists spending 84% of their time foraging below 5 m above the ground (saddleback&#160;tamarins&#160;tend to forage more a little higher, up to 10 m above the ground, and the moustached&#160;tamarins&#160;forage even higher up, mostly in the middle and lower canopy - above 10 m (Yoneda&#160;1981; Buchanan-Smith 1999; Porter 2007)).&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;tends to eat more vertebrates (frogs and lizards) than the&#160;tamarins. For a review see Heltne&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1981).&#160;<br/> <br/> In her long-term study of&#160;<em>Callimico</em>, Porter found that one group used an area of 114 ha, covering the entire home ranges of six&#160;tamarin&#160;groups (Porter 2007; Porter&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;Rehg&#160;(2003, 2007) on the other hand, found her&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;group using a range of about 59 ha; similar in size to the&#160;<em>Saguinus&#160;labiatus&#160;</em>group which they travelled with for about 67% of the time.&#160;Group size was 7 (six adults and&#160;subadults&#160;and an infant).&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;groups can be as large as 12 (Encarnación&#160;and Heymann 1998) and unlike other&#160;callitrichids&#160;can have more than one breeding female (Masataka&#160;1981a, 1981b). Copulations occur as soon as 10 days after the female gives birth indicating post-partum&#160;oestrus. They produce single offspring. Other members of the group help carry the young (communal breeding), with the first transfer from the mother a few days (4-11) after birth.&#160;<br/> <br/> <em>Callimico</em>&#160;travels and forages with saddleback&#160;tamarins&#160;(<em>Leontocebus fuscicollis</em>) and&#160;moustached&#160;tamarins&#160;(<em>Saguinus&#160;mystax</em>,&#160;<em>Saguinus&#160;labiatus</em>, and&#160;<em>Saguinus imperator</em>) (Pook&#160;and&#160;Pook&#160;1979a, b, 1981, 1982a). Lopes and&#160;Rehg&#160;(2003) recorded <em>Callimico</em>&#160;associating with&#160;<em>S. imperator</em>&#160;in the Serra do Divisor National Park, Brazil.&#160;Rehg&#160;(2003, 2006), Watsa <em>et al</em>. observed <em>Callimico</em> with <em>L. fuscicollis</em> and <em>S. imperator</em> at the Los Amigos Conservation Concession, Peru, from 2009-2011 (2012), and Porter (2001, 2007) studied the associations between&#160;<em>Callimico</em>,&#160;<em>Saguinus&#160;labiatus</em>, and&#160;<em>L.&#160;fuscicollis&#160;weddelli</em>&#160;in south-eastern Acre, Brazil, and north-western Pando, Bolivia, respectively. Porter (2007) reviews in detail the different specializations of&#160;<em>Callimico</em>, saddleback&#160;tamarins&#160;and&#160;moustached&#160;tamarins&#160;that allow for their&#160;sympatry.</p> <p> Of the&#160;callitrichids, <em>Callimico</em> is the strongest leaper and has the most evident anatomical adaptations for vertical clinging and leaping between small trees, large tree trunks, and lianas at very low heights (4-5m above the forest floor) (Rylands and Mittermeier 2013).<br/> <br/> Size:<br/> Adult males 366 g (n=3) (Encarnación&#160;and Heymann 1998)<br/> Adult females 355 g (n=5) (Encarnación&#160;and Heymann 1998)<br/> These are wild specimens.

A comprehensive review of all mammal survey data recorded sightings of <em>Callimico </em>in only 37 of 340 sites surveyed (10.9%), of which only 29 sites involved sightings of <em>Callimico</em> in the wild (not as pets or during captures). These sites are spread throughout the country, encompassing the vast majority of its lowland forests (Watsa <em>et al.</em> 2012). At the time of this evaluation, protection of any kind was available only to half of the 37 sites at which the animal was found, and this includes a very broad definition of “governmental protection”.&#160; <em>Callimico </em>has only been verified in six localities in Peru in the decade before this study was completed (Watsa <em>et al</em>. 2012) - Tahuamanu, Yurua River, Sierra del Divisor, Manu National Park, and two sites within its buffer zone (Manu Wilderness Center and Los Amigos Conservation Concession). In Manu National Park, the most heavily studied site of all with a specific focus on long-term studies of callitrichine primates, there have only been two sets of sightings. These were separated by 15 years and were of a single animal in the same bamboo stand. Intensive searching subsequently has not produced further sightings.</p> <p> Of the 6 sites in which <em>Callimico</em> was reported within a decade of this study, only two are now protected, one of which (the Sierra del Divisor) was only named a national park in 2015. The remaining areas face grave threats. The Los Amigos and Tahuamanu sites are adjacent to the Interoceanic Highway, which has spurred increasing deforestation and development along its course – both legal and illegal (Delgado 2008, Asner<em> et al.</em> 2010, Gallice <em>et al</em>. 2017). The Manu Wilderness Center, Los Amigos, Manu National Park and Tahuamanu also face a rapid and ever-increasing threat of deforestation due to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). The Madre de Dios exports ~70% of Peru’s ASGM gold production (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2011), and a 400% increase in deforestation due to ASGM occurred between 1999-2012 (Asner<em> et al.</em> 2013). From 2006 to 2009, approximately 20 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Amazon forest was cleared each year for ASGM, and deforestation caused by ASGM went from 5,350 acres per year before 2008 to 15,180 acres each year after the 2008 global financial crisis (Daley 2016). ASGM also uses mercury, an environmental pollutant that has been detected in unsafe levels both in human and animal populations in the region (Moreno-Brush <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018; Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p> <p> In Brazil and Peru the Interoceanic highway intersects the southern end of the geographic range of <em>Callimico goeldii</em> and has led to major deforestation along its path.  The highway, which runs just north and west of the border with Bolivia, is in the same region in which <em>Callimico goeldii</em> have been reported to be at high densities (Porter 2006), and where multiple observations of the species have been made (Watsa<em> et al.</em> 2012).  The extent to which this asphalt highway has impacted <em>Callimico goeldii</em> populations has not been quantified, but it is likely to be severe. Populations in eastern Peru and western Brazil which are not located near major highways are likely to be more protected from anthropogenic disturbance.  However, as it is likely there are genetically distinct populations of <em>Callimico </em>across its range, the southern populations deserved increased protection.</p> <p><a name=""_Hlk491035251""></a> In Bolivia, <em>Callimico goeldii</em> are restricted to the Department of Pando.  The Pando has the fastest human population growth in Bolivia and the capitol city of Cobija is the fastest growing city in the country (INE 2013).  As a result, deforestation in the Pando is leading to the loss of habitat for <em>Callimico goeldii</em>. Plans have been approved to create a new highway to connect Cobija to La Paz via a new north-south road, and to pave an existing dirt road to connect Cobija to Extrema, Peru. These roads will further accelerate the destruction of forests in the northwestern region of the Pando. Bamboo often reforests areas that have been cleared for agriculture or pasture. Studies are needed to determine&#160;<em>Callimico</em>'s&#160;degree of tolerance for habitat disturbance in its range (Porter 2007).  </p> <p> In Colombia, the arc of deforestation growing from the Andes foothills to the east into the lowland forest, has reached areas as far as La Paya National Park, and the lower Caguán River, extending to the north and north-east towards Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park. Deforestation has indeed affected numerous areas of La Paya National Park, where historically, illegal crops and timber extraction have also been a driver of deforestation.  </p>","<p> This species has a very localized and patchy distribution. It is always rare and difficult to observe.&#160;Groups are generally widely separated, determined by the availability of the right mix/mosaic of habitats and food availability. Key habitat such as stream edge, bamboo forest and secondary growth patches are needed due to their predilection for certain species of fungus.<br/><br/>It is suspected that a population decline of 30% or more over the course of 18 years (three generations; 2018-3036) will occur due to the threats faced by the species. Presence/absence surveys suggest that it is sympatric in 12% or less of tropical sites surveyed for other Neotropical mammals.<br/><br/>Recorded population density estimates in Bolivia, include:&#160;0.29 groups/km² (Izawa and&#160;Yoneda&#160;1981); 0.25 groups/km² (Pook&#160;and&#160;Pook&#160;1981); 9.6 individuals/km² (Cameron&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1989); and 6.1 individuals/km² (Porter 2007).<br/><br/>Rehg&#160;(2003, 2007) recorded 0.8-1.2 groups/km² in an 820-ha forest patch in Acre, Brazil. This is higher than density estimates recorded from Bolivia, and&#160;Rehg&#160;(2007) believed it might be related to habitat heterogeneity, including disturbance associated with tree falls.<br/> <br/> Porter (2007) combined all group counts reported in the literature and calculated an average group size of 6.4 individuals, and a general population density&#160;of 5.6 individuals/km²&#160;where they occur. At one site in the far north-west of Bolivia, Porter (2007) estimated&#160;37 individuals/km².<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Callimico goeldii</em> occurs in the upper Amazon from the Rio Caquetá in Colombia, south through the Peruvian Amazon and the extreme western Amazon of Brazil into the Pando region of northern Bolivia (Hernández-Camacho and Barriga-Bonilla 1966, Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976, Hershkovitz 1977). Hershkovitz (1977) predicted that it should occur in the Ecuadorian Amazon, but it has not been found there to date. Despite its wide range, <em>Callimico </em>is notoriously patchy in its distribution and is evidently absent over a large part of it.<br/><br/>In Colombia, it occurs from the base of the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes in the Department of Putumayo between the Ríos Putumayo and Caquetá east at least to the mouth of the Río Cahuinarí, a right bank affluent of the Caquetá. It is not known to occur in the Colombian trapezius (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004).<br/><br/>In Peru, it is evidently limited largely to the eastern Amazon. Hershkovitz (1977) mapped numerous localities south of the Río Napo, along the lower and middle Río Ucayali and the Río Tapiche. The westernmost locality given by Hershkovitz (1977, map p.864) is on the Rio Marañon, but it is listed in the gazetteer as “Apaga (Rio), enters Río Putumayo from south at approximately 4º42'S, 77º10'W, P. Soini, April 1970, sight record”. The coordinates would seem to be right, but the description of the locality wrong, and the Rio Marañon is excluded from the distribution map of Aquino and Encarnación (1994a). These authors have <em>Callimico </em>only definitely occurring south of the lower Ucayali (from the mouth of the Rio Blanco), extending to both sides of the Ucayali at about 6ºS and south along the Andean foothills to the Río Pachitea and the Madre de Dios. It occurs in the Manu National Park (Aquino and Encarnación 1994a, Watsa <em>et al</em>. 2012) and as far east within Peru as the Los Amigos Conservation Concession north of the Madre de Dios River (Watsa<em> et al.</em> 2012). From there it extends east into extreme northern Bolivia, north of the Río Tahuamanu (Buchanan-Smith<em> et al.</em> 2000, Christen and Geismann 1994, Watsa <em>et al</em>. 2012). Christen and Geismann (1994) reported seeing <em>Callimico</em> south of the Río Nareuda, indicating it occurs south as far as the Rio Muyumanu. Buchanan-Smith <em>et al</em>. (2000) found no evidence of its occurrence south of the Tahuamanu-Nareuda. <em><br/><br/>Callimico </em>occurs in a small part of the south-west Brazilian Amazon in the state of Acre, through the Serra do Divisor south of the upper Rio Juruá to the Rio Gregório (state of Amazonas), to the Rio Iaco (above the Rio Acre) on the south (right) bank of the upper Purús, and into the Madeira basin along the Rio Abunã in the state of Rondônia (Hershkovitz 1977, Ferrari <em>et al</em>. 1999, Lopes and Rehg 2003).<br/><br/>The range of this species (both the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy) are suspected to be in decline, given that the species is found in four of the world's top seven countries in terms of current rates of tropical forest loss: Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. Increased forest loss within this species' range is likely to be driven by human population expansion, road construction projects, slash-and-burn agriculture, timber harvesting and artisanal gold mining.","A recent evaluation of the state of the wildlife trade in Peru revealed that&#160;<em>Calllimico&#160;</em>was sold in a market in Tumbes for the second highest price of any other trafficked primate (Shanee<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017), and the high percent of&#160;<em>Callimico&#160;</em>records that involve captures or presence as pets also indicates their attractiveness to this trade.",Terrestrial,"<p>Less than half of the forests in which&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;is found are protected.&#160; Increased forest loss within this species' range is likely to be driven by human population expansion, road construction projects, slash-and-burn agriculture, timber harvesting and artisanal gold mining.</p><p> This species occurs in the following protected areas:<br/> <br/> Brazil<br/> Serra do Divisor National Park (846,408 ha) (Calouro&#160;1999; Lopes and&#160;Rehg&#160;2003)<br/> <br/> Colombia<br/> Amacayacu&#160;Natural National Park (293,000 ha) Within presumed range (Defler 1994, 2003, 2004)<br/> Cahuinarí&#160;Natural National Park (575,500 ha) Within presumed range (Defler 2003, 2004)<br/> La&#160;Paya&#160;Natural National Park (442,000 ha) (INDERENA 1989;&#160;Polanco-Ochoa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999) Within presumed range (Defler 2003, 2004).<br/> <br/> Peru<br/> Manu National Park (Terborgh&#160;1983), Sierra del Divisor National Park (Vriesendorp <em>et al.</em> 2005, Hershkovitz 1977), Los Amigos Conservation Concession (Watsa <em>et al.</em> 2012), Pucacuro National Reserve (Soini 2001; Vriesendorp <em>et al</em>. 2006 )</p> <p> Bolivia</p> <p> Estaciones Biológicas de Abuná y Tahuamanu (Porter 2007; Nacimento in prep.)<br/> <br/> <br/> It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
17940021,41536,Saimiri boliviensis,Least Concern,,2018,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern because it is widespread and abundant, relatively adaptable to habitat degradation, and not subject to high levels of hunting.","Typically prefers seasonally inundated forests, river edge forest, floodplain, and secondary forests. They use all levels of the forest, but forage and travel mainly in the lower canopy and understorey. Locomotion involves predominantly quadupredal walking and running.<br/><br/>Squirrel monkeys are small frugivore-insectivores. They spend 75-80% of their day foraging for insects and other small animal prey (Mittermeier and Van Roosmalen 198, Terborgh 1983, Boinski 1988). During dry season shortages of appropriate fruiting trees they are able to depend entirely on animal prey (Janson and Boinski 1992). <br/><br/><em>Saimiri</em> groups are multi-male and can be large, up to 100 animals (larger groups are believed to be temporary mergers of two) but most frequently are of 20-75 individuals (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Terborgh 1983, Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 1991). As emphasized by Boinski (1999a,b, 2005, Boinski <em>et al.</em> 2005a,b) allthough all squirrel monkeys are morphologicallly very similar, their social systems are quite distinct (summarized in Sussman 2000).<br/><br/>In <em>S. boliviensis</em>, studied by Terborgh (1983) and Mitchell <em>et al.</em> (1991), groups range from 45 to 75 individuals. Females form stable, probably kin-based, coalitions and dominance hierarchy. Females are philopatric (remain in the groups they were born in), while males leave their groups at 4-5 years old, form all-male (bachelor) groups and then disperse into other groups with both sexes. Males are generally unfriendly to each other, and change groups every one or two years. Females commonly show social agression amongst themselves. Adult females are always dominant to males, harass them, and maintain on them on the periphery of the group. Unlike <em>S. oerstedi</em>, males do not show anti-predator vigilance. The fruits they typically exploit occur in large patches of moderate density, and feeding competition is higher than in <em>S. oerstedii</em>, but lower than in <em>S. sciureus</em>.<br/><br/>In <em>S. sciureus</em>, studied in Suriname by Boinski (1999a,b, 2005, Boinski <em>et al.</em> 2005a,b), group sizes range from 15 to 50, and both sexes form a single, linear hiearchy in the group, with most males being dominant to females. Aggression between females is uncommon, but they  do not form coalitions. Males form coalitions and can aggressive to each other. Males show vigilance in defense agianst predators. The fruits they exploit typically occur in small but extremely dense patches, and there is considerable feeding competition between group members, much higher than in <em>S. boliviensis</em>. <br/><br/>In <em>S. oerstedii</em>, females do not form dominance hierarchies, and there is no evidence of coalition formation in social interactions. Females transfer between groups before first mating season, and males are philopatric. There is little competition or agonistic interactions between groups, and males show high levels of vigilance for predators.  Reproductively mature males collaborate in mobbing females during the mating season. Their fruits they typically exploit occur in small and very scarce patches, and feeding competition is very low. <br/><br/>Mating and births in <em>Saimiri</em> are highly seasonal, seldom exceeding two months in duration. Single offspring. Mating usually occurs during the dry season. In <em>S. oerstedii</em> sexual receptivity in females is synchronized, and lasts only one or two days each season. In <em>S. sciureus</em>, birth synchrony is less pronounced, and the female gives birth occur once a year (Rowe 1996). In <em>S. boliviensis</em>, the interbirth interval is 24 months (Mitchell 1994).<br/><br/><em>Saimiri boliviensis</em> and <em>S. sciureus</em> frequently form interspecific associations, travelling with <em>Cebus albifrons</em> or <em>Cebus apella</em> (Terborgh 1983, Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2000), benefitting from the disturbance caused by the capuchin monkeys above them, which flushes out insects and small animal prey.<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Weight: Adult male 992 g, adult female more than 751 g.","This species is hunted for subsistence use particularly in areas that have already suffered the loss of larger primate species. Habitat loss is also occurring, although not levels that warrant threatened status. Some capture for pets and medical research occurs, notably in Peru.","The species is common, occurring frequently in large groups of more than 50 animals. Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reported that <em>Saimiri boliviensis</em> was a common species in Peruvian Amazonia. Abundance characteristics are not appreciably different between the two subspecies.<br/><br/>Bolivia<br/>Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2000) recorded primate encounter rates along transects at eight sites in the Rios Blanco y Negro Wildlife Reserve, Santa Cruz, Bolivia. <em>Saimiri boliviensis</em> was seen at two of the sites with an encounter rate of 0.2 and 0.7 groups/10 km, or 4.9 and  9.8 individuals/10 km, respectively. In the Beni Reserve, Painter <em>et al.</em> (1995) recorded an encounter rate of 0.6 groups or 20 individuals/10 km. In the Bosque Chimanes, Rumiz and Herrera (1994) recorded 1.7 groups or 36.4 individuals/10 km. Wallace <em>et al.</em> (1998) did not find squirrel monkeys in the Noel Kempf Mercado National Park where they surveyed (east of the Río San Martín, Santa Cruz Department).<br/><br/>Brazil<br/>Peres (1997) estimated densities of <em>S. boliviensis boliviensis</em> at várzea (white-water flooded forest) in the Brazilian Amazon: Sacado do Condor 70.7 individuals/km²; Boa Esperança 149.2 individuals/km².

Wallace <em>et al.</em> (1998) did not find squirrel monkeys in the Noel Kempf Mercado National Park, and indicated that there are no records of this subspecies east of Perseverancia where they surveyed, on the Río Negro, although there are reports of it occurring as far east as the upper Río San Martín. In Peru, Aquino and Encarnación (1994) indicated its occurrence south from the Río Abujao, Department of Ucayali, to Bolivia, and in parts of Huánaco, Pasco, Junín and Cusco. Altitudinal range according to Hershkovitz (1984) is 50 to 500 m asl.

The Red-shanked Douc is diurnal and arboreal but occasionally come to the ground as evinced by a number of camera-trap pictures within its range.<br/><br/>The species has been very little studied in the wild with only two long-term (&gt;12 months) studies, and other opportunistic observations (Lippold 1998; Phiapalath 2009; Ulibarri 2013). The diet of Red-shanked Douc consists mainly of leaves (consistently with a highest percentage of young leaves), followed by fruits/seeds, flowers, bark/pith (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003; Phiapalath 2009; Ulibarri 2013). The group dynamics of the species remain little understood. Studies suggest the species has a modular society characterized by fission-fusion of several one-male units gathering and dividing daily (Ulibarri 2013; Long Thang Ha pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Because of this apparent group dynamics observed in the species and genus, home range is challenging to assess and needs to be distinguished between home range of the unit vs. home range of the group (i.e., fusion of &gt;1 units). In Lao PDR, the average home range for two groups (of 19 and 39 individuals, both comprising between 2 to 3 units) was estimated at 3 km²<sup> </sup>(Phiapalath 2009). In Viet Nam, home range of a group (21 individuals, including three units) was estimated at 36 ha (Ulibarri 2013). The striking contrast between these two estimates calls for additional long-term studies on the species. In Viet Nam, it was found that the fission–fusion pattern is strongly related to the daily activity budgets, food availability and rainfall (Ulibarri 2013). Average size of a unit was 6.5 individuals, average size of a group was 18 individuals, and groups averaged ~3 units/group. Units were one-male/multi-female and multi-male/multi-female (Ulibarri 2013).<br/><br/>The annual activity budget of <em>P. nemaeus</em> was estimated in limestone forest in Lao PDR at 40% feeding, 10% moving, 33% resting, 5% socialising and 14% other activities (Phiapalath 2009). In Viet Nam, in a coastal evergreen forest, the species spent 35% ‘inactive’, 29% moving, 22% socialising, 14% feeding and 1% self-grooming (Ulibarri 2013).<br/><br/>Additional research needs to be done on the ecology of the species to clarify its home range, group dynamics, diet and nutritional requirements.</p>","<p>Hunting has been and still is the major threat to <em>Pygathrix nemaeus</em> across its range. Habitat loss has also been a major threat in Viet Nam with extensive logging for coffee, rubber, and cashew plantations (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2004), and in Lao PDR where logging is underway at an increasing rate for mining, agriculture, forestry and hydropower projects, mostly by large Chinese and Vietnamese companies (Smirnov 2015). Habitat loss and fragmentation have led to an increase in access to remote forests for illegal hunting of the species, contributing to the alarming declines of the global population. Hunting of the species across its range is for local consumption (the meat of doucs is highly favoured by locals) or for national and/or international trade. Pet trade in Red-shanked Douc may also drive hunting (Tran Thu Hang 2010), though to a lesser extent and is likely to be more opportunistic than directed, occurring when adults are killed leaving behind orphans, which are sold as pets. In Lao PDR, the species is hunted by both Lao and Vietnamese poachers crossing the border. Lao hunters often sell poached doucs to Vietnamese. Doucs are highly valued in Viet Nam for the traditional medicine; bones are processed to make a paste, which is used for the ‘treatment’ of various ailments. Due to hunting, Red-shanked Douc has already been largely extirpated throughout Viet Nam with the exceptions of populations in Phong Nha Ke Bang NP, where the species is apparently naturally protected by the difficult accessibility of this karst-based forest habitat, at least in its most remote sites, and in Son Tra NP where, although suitable forest for the species is now very limited, hunting seems under control and the species attracts a significant number of national and international tourists (Ha Thang Long pers. comm. 2015). In Virachey NP, illegal poaching occurs and doucs are hunted, most likely by Vietnamese poachers (G. McCann pers. comm. 2016). As douc populations are decreasing at an alarming rate, the hunting pressure on the species is expected to rise rapidly in all remaining areas where it occurs.<br/><br/>By the mid-to-late 1990s, Red-shanked Douc populations in several areas in Lao PDR and Viet Nam had already been greatly reduced or totally extirpated despite remaining suitable habitat (Timmins and Duckworth 1999; Nadler <em>et al. </em>2003). This decline has been continuous and is likely to be increasing with the demand and lucrative trade in wildlife including specifically Doucs. Populations in Viet Nam alone have decreased to just a few individuals left in most localities of occurrence (Nadler 2010). In Lao PDR, several sites that were visited in the mid-1990s and then again in the 2000s and 2010s suggest a surprising decline in Red-shanked Doucs (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013) The still large and healthy population of Red-shanked Doucs are now confined to the largest forest blocks in the range countries (Phiaphalath 2009, Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in the past 36 years (and much less) habitat loss in range countries has been on the rise due to large development projects (e.g., dams, roads, mining, agriculture plantations) (Smirnov 2015); therefore those contiguous forest blocks—even protected areas—are much more extensively accessed today than in the recent past, which predicts a continuing decline in Red-shanked Doucs due to harvesting, principally in those areas with a lack of or poor conservation management; one or other of these situations applies to all protected areas holding the species.</p>","<p>The world’s largest remaining population of Red-shanked Douc Langur is in Lao PDR, particularly in the near-contiguous Nakai-Nam Theun and Hin Namno National Protected Areas (NPA), which are likely to represent the largest contiguous suitable habitat for the species (Coudrat <em>et al. </em>2012, 2013). Nakai-Nam Theun NPA probably holds the world’s largest population with an estimate of at least 4,500 groups in the area’s suitable habitat, estimated to comprise at least 1,600 km². Red-shanked Doucs are fairly frequently encountered in this area, although nowadays at lower rates than langurs <em>Trachypithecus</em> in Hin Namno NPA (Phiapalath 2009, Coudrat 2015); in the late 1990s rates were comparable between the genera (Timmins and Duckworth 1999). Xe Sap NPA also appears to retain a significant population (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013). The most remote suitable forested areas in Lao PDR within the species’ range evidently still hold large numbers, but population estimates are not available for most areas. Despite the remaining large population in Lao PDR, the population in the past three decades has dramatically declined.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the population has declined extremely steeply due to intensive and continuous hunting and habitat loss; these threats are still ongoing and at an increasing rate. Many areas where doucs were recorded during the 1990s to 2002 lack evidence of their subsequent persistence (Nadler 2010). Wildlife surveys found &lt;30 individuals in Bach Ma NP (Le Thi Dien <em>et al.</em> 2010), about 30-70 individuals in Dak Rong NR (Nguyen Dac Manh <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dang Huy Huynh and Nguyen Manh Ha 2005) and a few groups (not comprehensive survey of the area) in Bac Huong Hoa NR (Mahood and Tran Van Hung 2008). The largest population in Viet Nam is believed to be in Phong Nha Ke Bang with up to 2,000 individuals (Haus <em>et al.</em> 2009), though this may be an over estimate (Nadler 2010). Son Tra NP, located near Da Nang, the fifth largest city of Viet Nam, is thought to hold the second largest population in Viet Nam. This is estimated at only about 200 individuals (Vu Ngoc Thanh<em> et al.</em> 2007; Lippold and Vu Ngoc Thanh 2008; Dinh Thi Phuong Anh <em>et al.</em> 2010). At this site, suitable habitat is no more than 50 km², amid a zone of large-scale infrastructure development, and hunting occurs occasionally in the area. Chu Mom Ray NP may still hold a small population, representing a possible zone of sympatry and/or hybridization, but the taxonomic status of the species there is uncertain (Lippold <em>et al.</em> 2011). Outside protected areas in Viet Nam, some small populations were recorded in the buffer zone of Phong Dien NR and Bach Ma NP (Van Ngoc Thinh <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, animals genetically identifiable as Red-shanked Douc, but not morphologically typical, occur in Virachay National Park and a forest area in Voensai District. In both these areas the population is considered large based on frequent encounters (Rawson 2010). Grey-shanked Douc may also range in at least part of these areas, and hybridization has been recorded (Rawson and Roos 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in eastern Lao PDR, central Viet Nam and, perhaps northeastern Cambodia. In Viet Nam Red-shanked Douc ranges from Pu Mat National Park (NP) (19°02’N) in the north to Chu Mom Ray NP (14°22’N) in the south (Ha Thang Long 2007, 2009). In Lao PDR, the species has been confirmed from Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area (formerly known as Nam Theun Extension; 18°38’N), down to the Cambodian border (14°25’N) (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Cambodia, a few individuals were first observed in 2007 (at N14°01’52.2”, E106°44’05.6”) and again in 2008 (at N14°01’32.4”, E106°42’51.9”) in Voensei District, Ratanakiri Province. The individuals observed showed some facial characteristics of Red-shanked Douc, but were otherwise not typical of Red-shanked Douc morphologically (e.g., lacking red on the legs, lacking white on the forearms, mostly uniformly grey body but with some variations observed between individuals); some DNA (mitochondrial, autosomal and sex chromosome fragments) was extracted from faecal samples collected following the 2007-sighting, which indicated closest similarity to Red-shanked Douc (Rawson and Roos 2008). There has not been new genetic analysis on a larger sample since. Across its range, the species’ typical pelage characteristics are somewhat lost gradually from north to south: in southern Lao PDR, some individuals have also been observed with reduced red on the legs and white on the forearms (Timmins and Duckworth 1999). Additional genetic analysis on these animals will be required to clarify morphological characteristics of Red-shanked Douc and the distribution range of the species. Grey-shanked Douc might occur sympatrically with<em> </em>Red-shanked Douc in the southernmost part of the range of Red-shanked Douc<em>. </em>Previous suggestion that<em> </em>Black-shanked Douc occurs in the same site as Red-shanked Douc in northeastern Cambodia was in error (Rawson 2010; B.

This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or slightly higher in the next 36 years.","<p><span class=""None"">These animals are predominantly arboreal but occasionally come to the ground. They are found in evergreen, semi-evergreen and semi-evergreen-mixed deciduous forest mosaics, as well as in coastal dry forest. It seems that this species can adapt to relatively heavily disturbed forest (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species occurs from sea level in Nui Chua NP to over 2,000 m asl. in Bidoup Nui Ba NP (Hoang Minh Duc 2007; Hoang Minh Duc pers. comm). Diet is apparently variable by site, being mainly composed of leaves with differing levels of supplementation with seeds, fruits and flowers (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al</em>. 2009; Rawson 2009). The species consumes plant parts of more than 150 plant species but are quite selective. Factors determining food selection are poorly known. The species was reported to choose plant species with high in protein and low in tannin compared to non-selected species (O’Brien 2014) but another study did not confirm this conclusion (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species shows seasonal shifting in habitat preferences in order to track leaf resources (O’Brien 2014).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>The annual activity budget of <em>P. nigripes</em> was estimated in evergreen forest in Cambodia at 61% inactivity, 27% feeding, 6% travel, 3% social behaviour, and 2% other activities (Rawson 2009) while in a coastal dry forest in Ninh Thuan Province of Viet Nam, the species spent 42.9% inactive, 35.0% feeding, 14.7% moving, 6.0% socializing, and 1.40% other behaviours (Hoang Minh Duc 2007). The species is reported to exhibit a fission-fusion social organization with smaller groups of one-male units banding together to form much larger groups (Hoang Minh Duc 2007, O’Brien 2014, Rawson 2009) and bachelor groups and lone males were also observed (Hoang Minh Duc 2007; Rawson 2009). Because of the complex social organization additional study is needed to understand ranging behavior. Home range of a group of <em>P. nigripes</em> in evergreen forest in Cambodia was estimated at 20.4 ha and daily path length ranged between 514 m and 943 m (Rawson 2009) while home range of a OMU with five individuals recorded in semi-evergreen forest in Binh Thuan Province was estimated at 12.4 ha and its daily path length was 354±250 m (Nguyen Thanh Trung and Hoang Minh Duc 2015).</span></p>","<p><span class=""None"">The key threats to the taxon include hunting for traditional medicine and local consumption and loss and fragmentation of forest habitats due to legal and illegal logging, conversion for agriculture, and construction of roads and hydroelectric dams.<br/><br/>Hunting is currently the major threat to this species (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). It is most often hunted for traditional “medicine”, mainly from people coming from the north of Viet Nam where hunting of Doucs for this purpose is more common; in the southern part of Viet Nam, hunting is primarily for the pet trade. Between 2008 and 2010 there were a confirmed total of over 150 Black-shanked Doucs being poached in Viet Nam (Hoang Minh Duc pers. comm).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>Destruction of its natural habitat is also a threat to this species; a large portion in the centre and south of Viet Nam suffered from massive wartime damage, and the post-war human demographic explosion and extensive logging for coffee, rubber, and cashew plantations have reduced its natural habitat. Most forest at lowland elevations has been cleared and little forest remains undisturbed (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). The resettlement of some 3 million people from the north of Viet Nam to the central highlands is likely to exacerbate rates of habitat loss through the Vietnamese range of the species. Development including new road construction in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia has been associated with a rapid increase of illegal logging that is negatively impacting habitat for the Black-shanked Doucs.</span></p>","<span class=""None"">The largest known population exists in Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, where distance estimates provide a population estimate of approximately 42,000 individuals (95% confidence interval of 27,309–66,460) (Pollard <em>et al</em>. 2007). The densities found in Seima are probably close to carrying capacity for the species in such habitat (Rawson 2009).

(Ha Thang Long 2004, 2007, 2009). Like the other doucs, <em>Pygathrix cinerea</em> is largely arboreal and mainly folivorous, though plant buds, fruit, seeds, and flowers are also taken (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003; Ha Thang Long 2009). The most detailed study of the ecology of this species is Ha Thang Long (2009) and he found that their annual diet consisted of 49.5% young leaves, 9.3% mature leaves, fruits and seeds 40%. He also noted that there were significant differences in the diet between the wet and dry seasons with fruit being consumed at a much higher frequency in the wet season and the young leaves in the dry season. Ha Thang Long <em>et al.</em> (2010) reported on differences in activity budgets in the wet and dry season also. They found that this species’ activity budget in the wet season was 41% resting, 22% moving, 11% feeding, and 26% socializing.&#160; In contrast the activity budget during the dry season was 32% resting, 31% moving, 13% feeding, and 24% socializing. This species is usually observed in one male – multi-female groups. A number of these groups occasionally will come together to form a large band. All male groups also occur (Ha Thang Long 2009).","<span class=""None"">The Central Highlands forests in Viet Nam where these animals occur lose almost 10,000 ha of forest annually due to logging, agricultural conversion, building hydropower stations, and construction of roads. This creates a progressively more fragmented habitat and population structure. Additionally, they are hunted for food, traditional ""medicine"" (for example it is used in the preparation of ""monkey balm""), and for sale as pets (Ha Thang Long 2004, 2007). Their behavioural responses to hunting, hiding motionless in the canopy rather than fleeing, make them more vulnerable (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003); they also become susceptible to snaring when they come to the ground to move in degraded habitats.","The total population for this species is estimated at 550 to 700 individuals, but some areas with assumed occurrence are not yet surveyed (Ha Thang Long 2004).<br/><br/>                    <span class=""None"">The global population is unknown but is likely smaller than 2,000.

17948571,39792,Macaca leonina,Vulnerable,A2acd+3cd,2020,2015-11-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Northern Pig-tailed Macaque is listed as Vulnerable as its population is suspected to have declined by over 30% over the last three generations (36-39 years) across its entire distribution range due to multiple threats. This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or higher over the next three generations. Ongoing threats from increasing habitat loss due to development, new settlements, agriculture, plantation, and other activities, and from hunting for various reasons, the species is likely to face a higher threat of decline unless specific actions are taken to ensure its survival. Nationally, in India this species is listed as Endangered, and in Bangladesh it is Critically Endangered.</p>","This is a predominantly arboreal animal. It is diurnal and frugivorous. It occupies tropical evergreen and semi­-evergreen forest, tropical wet evergreen forest, tropical&#160; moist deciduous forest, coastal forest, swamp forest, low elevation pine forests (in Lao PDR and China) and montane forest, including degraded forests. In China the species occupies elevations between 50­2,000 m (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Choudhury 2003). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is associated with low lands, usually below 500 m. Its generation length is 12-­13 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). According to secondary information and recent records, populations in Myanmar live between 190­-400 m (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>Dark evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, tropical, subtropical and deciduous forests in plains, foothills, hills. (50-2,000 m). Found in lowland primary, secondary forest, pine, dry dipterocarp, coastal swamp, montane forest. Frequently observed in riparian forests in western Thailand and Laos, occasionally near human settlements, cultivated fields where it once relatively common (back in 1990), even in highly degraded regions. Known to share associations with Assamese macaques (<em>Macaca assamemensis</em>) western Thailand and the ranges of the two species were observed to overlap in Assam. Range overlaps also with Stump-tailed and Rhesus macaques besides langurs and Hoolocks (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>This species eats more than 91 kinds of plants such as mature and tender leaves, leaf buds, leaf petioles, seeds, stems, climbers, roots, flowers, flower buds, inflorescences, bamboo shoots, and gums, insects, larvae, termite eggs and spiders. They also feed on post-harvest Rice paddy in NE India and fruits and vegetables by slash and burn agriculture of the hill tribe. Habituated groups have also been observed to beg for food and feed on biscuits as in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand.<br/><br/>In NE India, winter-spring breeding has been observed. Females are sexually receptive in August-December, but some might continue through to February. Birthing occurs in mid-January, early May, and a few in June. Swellings occur during breeding, as in Lion-tailed Macaques (<em>Macaca silenus</em>). Gestation period is 171-180 days (Choudhury 2008).<br/><br/>This species is primarily arboreal, but it may use both terrestrial and arboreal pathways; individuals flee from danger through trees and not by ground. They use the ground when crossing clearings, roads, to forage, feed in degraded areas and also feed on crops. Seasonal fluctuations dictate the time spent on the ground feeding on crops. One site reported macaques spending over 20% of their time feeding on the ground on sugar cane left overs by elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Detailed observation of the species in eastern and central Assam in 1992-1994 and 2004 recorded three peaks of feeding and long mid-day rest, shorter mid-morning rest spells, resting 45%, feeding 23.5%, locomotion 17-19.4%, grooming 6-8%. Actual time spent feeding 153-229 mins/day. Spent 65% of feeding time in January on harvested paddy.<br/><br/>In Assam (Tikleswari, Borajan) the macaques raids the vegetable gardens, crop field and villages (Chetry and Das pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is 83-347 ha, with about 25-48% overlap (Choudhury 2008). Daily movement is 690-2,240 m, influenced by weather and availability of fruits: where fruiting trees were far apart, the daily movement increased. Multi-male, multi-female groups of 12-40 individuals are seen (Choudhury 2008). Estimated group size in Laos rarely exceeds 20-30 individuals. There are few records of groups numbering 50-150 individuals in KhaoYai National Park in Thailand, DakLak Province in Viet Nam and DhouPhouVieng National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. It may be the case that two or more groups were feeding together.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km2 as studied in 21 sites.&#160; They spent only about 1% of their time on the ground and about 85% of their time on mid canopy and in 97.6% of the cases found inside the forest as opposed to the sympatric <em>M. mulatta </em>that is found outside forests in farms and gardens. Direct competition was found to be scarce between the species and the overlap or sharing of resources was only found to be 22.4%. Of the 101 plant species used between both the species, only 42.6%&#160; shared (Feroz, 2012).<br/><br/>In KhaoYai National Park,Thailand these macaques preferred tall sleeping trees (mean 20.9+/- SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’(15.8+/- SD 4.3 m) and tend to reuse the sleeping site, an anti-predator strategy (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Habitat disturbances affecting the future survival of this species include: selective logging; timber and firewood collection for making charcoal; building roads, dams, power lines; and deliberately setting fires. These threats lead to&#160; forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of&#160; India 2003) and the rate of habitat loss has not reduced. Recent forest cover survey report of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Government of India suggest that the dense forest cover in the distribution range is decreasing 2011-2013.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat&#160; loss likely is also a major threat to the&#160; species. In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000 USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, hunting, habitat loss and disturbance are major threats. There is a perceptible change in habitat quality that has an impact on the species (Huang <em>et al</em>. pers. comm).","In China, the species’ population is estimated to be less than 1,700 individuals (Jiang and Long pers. comm). No information is available on the status of the population dynamics, but it is suspected to be in decline. A very small population occurs in Bangladesh, which is isolated from the neighbouring Indian locations. This habitat is degrading rapidly, thereby causing a continuing decline in mature individuals in the country (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>A group density of 0.07 individuals/km² was recorded in Namdapha National Park, India, by Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003). There is no precise information available on population numbers in Myanmar. In India the population is &lt;1,500 individuals and populations are declining rapidly (Chetry and Das pers. comm.) but in one protected area (Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary) it is increasing. Choudhury (2003) stated that there may have been around 24,000 of these macaques in India at the turn of this century. The population has apparently declined owing to habitat loss.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km² as studied in 21 sites. The mean of seven groups in Assam was 23.3 (range: 16-33) (Choudhury 2008); however, the largest group observed was of 43 macaques in Radhakishorepur reserved forest, Tripura in 2016 (Choudhury 2017).<br/><br/>It is also declining steadily in Myanmar.&#160; The animals are very patchily distributed in Myanmar. <br/><br/>The species is widely distributed and common in large forest blocks remaining in southern and central Lao PDR, but it is much scarcer in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam (R. Timmins pers. comm). It is widely distributed through the remaining forest areas of Cambodia. Populations are stable in Thailand. <br/><br/>Declines are due to different threats in different countries. There have been declines of more than 30% in the last 30­-35 (three generations) years in India, Bangladesh, China, Viet Nam and Myanmar. There are perceptible declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia, but the rates are close to or lower than 30%. In most of the countries, the species is predicted to decline at a rate higher than 30% over the next three generations due to increasing trends in habitat loss, persecution, and trade.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China (southwestern Yunnan), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (Choudhury 1988, 2013)), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand (from about 8°N and including adjacent islands), and central and southern Viet Nam. There might be a gap in the distribution in central and northeastern Myanmar between about 20 and 25°N, where it has not been recorded except on the coast at Arakan. In India found north to the Brahmaputra River (Groves 2001).<br/><br/>Records from Xizang (China) are probably misidentified rhesus macaques (MacKinnon in press).  It has recently been recorded from Namdapha National Park in northeastern India (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>The precise taxonomic boundary between <em>M. leonina</em> and <em>M. nemestrina</em> is not well defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limits in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans. The two species hybridize in a small area of southern peninsular Thailand, as well as on the islands of Phuket and Yao Yai (Groves 2001).  <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there are historical records from as far north as Nghe An province, but there is uncertainty whether the species was ever found north of this province. It is widely distributed throughout the lower elevations (below 500 m) of Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is found over much Myanmar except in areas of human settlements.","In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. In almost throughout its range, the species is hunted for meat and for 'medicine'. Hunting is rampant in areas of development mainly for food.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed under CITES Appendix II. It is listed as Schedule III in the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974, Category I under the Chinese Wildlife Protection Act (1989), and as Schedule II under the Indian Wildlife(Protection) Act, 1972 (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003), amended up to 2002. In Indian context the species facing severe threats with few populations left and needs revision of the Indian status so that in can get better protection. Northern pig­tailed macaques are known to occur in numerous protected areas, including Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary, Lawachara National&#160; Park, Rema ­Kelanga Wildlife Sanctuary (Bangladesh); Daxueshan Nature Reserve, Nanguanhe Nature Reserve, WuliangshanNature Reserve, Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve (China); Balpakhram National Park, Dampa Wildlife Sanctuary, Dibru­Saikhowa National Park, Fakim Wildlife Sanctuary, Garampani Wildlife Sanctuary, Holongopar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary, Intanki National Park, Kamlang WildlifeSanctuary, Lengteng Wildlife Sanctuary, Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, Murlen NationalPark, Namdapha National Park, Ngengpui Wildlife Sanctuary, Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary, Bherjan-Boorajan-Podumoni Wildlife Sanctuary, Phawngpui Blue Mountain National Park, Sepahijala Wildlife Sanctuary, Siju Wildlife Sanctuary, Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Yangoupokpi­ Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary (India); Pidaung Wildlife Sanctuary (Myanmar); Doi Suthep Pui National Park, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Thailand); Cat Tien National Park, Pu Mat National Park (Viet Nam). The species possibly occurs in Nam Ha National Biodiversity Conservation Area (Lao PDR) (M. Richardson pers. comm.; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). In India, it has been recorded in at least 29 protected areas (Choudhury 2016).<br/><br/>The species is considered Critically Endangered in Bangladesh and Endangered in India.<br/><br/>Destruction and degradation due to encroachment, monoculture tree plantations, fisheries, slash and burn shifting cultivation, by hill tribes (cultural minorities). They are also killed for food by Hill tribes in NE India as they have access to automatic firearms. Poaching rampant in Assam-Mizoram border. Poaching rampant in Assam-Mizoram border. In China, it is variously described as rare and endangered and thought to number to <em>ca</em>1,000 about the year 2000. The species was classified as Vulnerable in the Red Data Book of Viet Nam in 1990. Poaching for traditional medicine is now a threat to all primates in the country and no new conservation program is in place.<br/><br/>Other direct threats include logging, gold mining, shifting cultivation by the hill tribe minority, development of economy and infrastructure resulting in habitat loss and degradation, hunting for food by villagers, hunting for traditional medicine to supply bone to the Viet Nam for use in medicine. Although in their incipient stage, agriculture, mining and hydropower are causing significant damages in terms of forest loss. In Cambodia, the species is reported only in five out of 24 provinces: use in traditional medicine, loss of habitat from logging, and trade are major threats in the region. In Myanmar, logging, plantation, aquaculture, hunting for food and pets, political unrest in cultural minority states impact primates. Timber extraction, large scale farms and plantations, irrigation, hydroelectric projects, highway construction, mineral exploration, resettlement programs for hill tribes, recreation and tourism, have significantly reduced forest cover in Thailand. Shifting cultivation of hill tribes and ethnic Thais have cleared large forests. Illegal hunting for sale(market hunting) and poaching for food near villages could have a direct effect on primate population in Thailand, including <em>Macaca leonina</em>.

It prefers dense evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). Srivastava and Mohnot (2001) report it from lowland semi­evergreen forests to monsoon and montane forests. In India, it occurs at elevations of 50­2-700m (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003; Choudhury 2001, 2002; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001), between 200 and 2,200 m in Myanmar (Htun pers. comm.), and up to 2,400 m in China (X. Jiang pers. comm.); in Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia it is predominantly found above 400 m, while in karst limestone environments it is found in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is considered arboreal as well as terrestrial, and is diurnal. It feeds primarily on seeds and fruits. It has a generation time of 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003). It eats fruit, insects, small vertebrates, and immature leaves, and will also raid crops for potatoes and rice. It occurs widely in the hill and mountain areas of VietNam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). In Thailand it is widespread but discontinuous, in forests associated with limestone, and other forest habitats (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). In China it is found in broadleaved evergreen forests, and sometimes in secondary forests close to farmlands (X. Jiang pers. comm).<br/><br/>Long-term study in India reported that the species consume highest 23.65% of time on feeding of seeds, 21.81% in fruits, 14.22% in leaves and twigs, 10.35% in root and tubers. Moreover, they spent 8.09% in bamboo shoots and 7.79% in feeding other minor food items&#160; (Chetry and Chetry 2015).<br/><br/>Stump-tailed Macaque is very selective over the lodging trees it chooses; in India it has been found to use only six species of tree for lodging (Chetry and<strong>&#160;</strong>Bhattacharjee 2004).<br/><br/>The species is also found in lower altitudes; a young individual was captured in Cachar, Assam from 60 m asl. The elevation of Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary is just above 100 m. &#160;Climate varies from tropical to subtropical across the macaques in distribution. The species is good swimmer, but is terrestrial in habit.<br/><br/>It has been known to feed on vegetable materials, fruits, seeds, flowers, leaves, roots, tubers, cultigens like rice and corns, and opportunistic feeders on insects, frogs, birds, bird eggs and freshwater crabs.<br/><br/>Mean gestation: 177.3 days. Interbirth interval of 1.6 years. Diurnal in activity. Home ranges as measured in Jorhat District is 336-587 ha. Daily movement differs from one place to another: 2-3kms in Yunnan, China and 1.8-2.3km in Assam, India. Group size could be as small as 2-3 individuals or as big as 60-150 individuals.</p>","<p>Habitat disturbances affecting this species' survival include selective logging, timber and firewood collection for charcoal, building roads, dams, power lines and fisheries, deliberately set fires, fragmentation, and soil loss/erosion. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine,” and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In India much of its habitat is affected by Jhum cultivation (shifting or slash­and­burn) (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). It has also been indiscriminately hunted over almost its entire distribution in India (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). The vulnerability of being hunted is due to large body size and terrestrial in habit (Chetry and Das pers.com)<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is heavily targeted for use in traditional “medicine,” both in country and for trade with China. Agriculture, hydropower and mining developments are the other threats that need to be watched.<br/><br/>Within Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting levels for food is also very high. Habitat loss is a relatively lower threat compared to hunting (R. Timmins pers. comm).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, where Stump-tailed Macaques are found only in three of 24 sites, are yet threatened by concession mining, and land mining are existing threats even in protected areas.<br/><br/>In Laos, the species suffers from opportunistic hunting in their area of occurrence across the country for supply of bones for 'medicinal' use in Vietnam is threatening the population. Logging, gold mining and shifting cultivation are accounted as some direct threats. Other threats include extensive poaching and earlier were used in manufacturing polio medicine. Poaching for traditional medicine is still on unabated and therefore pressing the remaining population. Absence of any new conservation measure is in not helping the situation either.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, logging and timber extraction are major threats. Commercial rubber plantations, hunting, and trade of animals parts with China are all major threats to this species. In China, hunting and habitat loss have reduced in population of this species, and it is locally extinct in some places. Over hunting might have extirpated the population in Guangdong Province. Habitat loss from plundering of evergreen broad leaf forest is a serious threat. In Thailand, habitat loss is a major threat, while hunting is prevalent, but not a significant threat to the species (R. Boonratana pers. comm). Until 1976, until the ban on international trade in 1976 of primates, trade and export of Stump-tailed Macaque was well and active. The United States of America alone imported <em>ca</em> 30,000 primates from Thailand, mostly macaques, for use in biomedical research and some were famously sold as ‘miniature chimpanzees’. The population in peninsular Thailand was thus significantly reduced due to this trapping for trade and export. Large scale farming, plantations, marine product use resulting in habitat loss and habitat degradation has also affected the population.</p>","<p>Populations in South Asia and in Myanmar are few and fragmented (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003; S.Htun pers. comm.).

There are some declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia. Future declines are predicted to be faster in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, India, Myanmar and China due to habitat loss and/or hunting. <br/><br/>The population is declining rapidly in India except in the few protect areas, in fact, the species has been extirpated outside the protected areas except in few reserve forests (Chetry and Das pers. comm).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Cambodia, south­western China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces), north­eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura states), Lao PDR, north­western Peninsular Malaysia, northern Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

In 2015, the subpopulation within Siberut<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">s only protected area (Siberut National Park, covering &gt;40% of the island), was estimated to number just over 9,000 individuals (Quinten<em> et al</em>. 2015). <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""></span></span></p>","<p><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">Siberut macaques are semi-terrestrial and have been observed to live in almost all the forest types existing on Siberut (annual rainfall: <em>ca</em> 4,000 mm)—in both primary and disturbed areas—including dipterocarp-, mixed-, swamp- and mangrove forests as well as nipa palm groves (Whitten and Whitten 1982, Fuentes 2002); according to Wilson and Wilson (1976) they prefer primary riverine coastal swamp forest.<br/><br/>They occur in larger groups (up to 29 individuals are reported; Richter 2013) which often split up into smaller <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">“<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">foraging units<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">” <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">during the day (Fuentes 2002). These groups can consist of multiple adult males together with multiple adult females and their offspring (Richter 2013).<br/><br/>While an early study estimated the species<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">home range to encompass over 500 ha (Whitten and Whitten 1982), more recent data suggests smaller ranges of around 135 ha (Richter 2013/14). The same study reports a monthly average travel distance of the studied group of 2048.4 m and a travel speed of 169.6 m/h; these macaques spent 57.3 % of their time travelling, 14.6 % resting, 12.1 % foraging, 10.1 % feeding, and 5.9 % involved in social activities (Richter 2013).<br/><br/>With over 75% of their diet consisting of fruit, the species is primarily frugivorous (Richter 2013). However, it also consumes a number of other food items, like arthropod material (e.g., ants, spiders, termite eggs, larvae), mushrooms, leaves, the petioles of palm seedlings and also crabs as well as crayfish (Whitten and Whitten 1982, Richter 2013). Pith, sap, shoots and flowers are also eaten, but form a very small portion of the diet (&lt;4%).<br/><br/>Siberut macaques commonly sleep in tall trees near secondary-ridge tops (e.g., Dipterocarpus), and they are known to vocalise frequently, especially in the early morning hours <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">– <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">a behaviour that is assumed to support group cohesion (Whitten and Whitten 1982, Fuentes 2002).

Despite Siberut macaques not being the preferred food of the indigenous people (the meat is considered unpalatable), hunting pressure has increased in recent years. This is primarily the result of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Furthermore, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been progressively eroded due to missionary and state influences (Whittaker 2006; Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). Interview surveys in 50 villages on Siberut revealed that 24% of the respondents were <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">‘<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">active hunters<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">and 71% of those respondents target <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""><em>Macaca siberu</em><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">. The average number hunted per three months was two per hunter, leading to off-take estimates of 1,549<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">–<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">3,098 per year or between 5 and 18% of the total population (Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014).</span></span></span></span><br/><br/>Although the pet trade is also considered a threat (Whittaker 2006), Quinten <em>et al.</em> (2014) report that only 1 out of 390 interviewees in their study specifically indicated the use of primates as pets, so this is probably not a significant driver of the population decline.<br/><br/>Macaque groups are known to venture into the <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">‘<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">forest gardens<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">and coconut groves that surround the human settlements in search of food (Fuentes 2002); the species is therefore considered a pest and consequently killed (Whittaker 2006); sometimes sago traps are used, where hunters trap a whole group of macaques at once. Selective logging of the large trees which they need for daily sustenance might increase crop raiding behaviour and thus exacerbate the conflict with human communities (Richter 2014).<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""></span></span></span></p>","<p><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">Whittaker (2006) estimated the total macaque population on Siberut to comprise between 17,000-30,000 individuals.

B) They also suggest to place greater emphasis on outreach activities to foster successful interaction and cooperation between Park management and the resident communities, raising local awareness of the value of Siberut’s rainforest habitat and the importance of a sustainable approach to resource utilization. C) They recommend that further research be carried out, specifically time-series land-cover assessments to determine rates of deforestation/habitat loss, and long-term monitoring of population trends inside and outside the Park (in Siberut’s production forest/timber concessions).<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""></span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The hunting and logging is seen to increase with the burgeoning human population. Only 10-15% of the original forest cover remains on Sipora (Fuentes 1996/1997). Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 calibre air rifles (anything larger is illegal in Indonesia) (Whittaker 2006). They are often trapped and killed as crop pests. The Pagai macaque meat though is considered unpalatable but are one of the easiest to catch as they fall for traps. Often cages are used so entire troops are captured in one trap. The ground-living macaques are also affected by road construction where the habitat and territories are affected.<br/><br/>Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Though this species is not a preferred food item, it is still hunted and poisoned as it is considered a crop pest (Whittaker 2006). While habitat disturbance appears to positively affect population densities, it is found in lower densities near human settlements (Whittaker 2006).</p>","<p>All populations of this species are urgently in need of protective measures (Whittaker 2006). The estimates of density for it suggest 7-12 individuals/km² in suitable habitat in the Pagai Islands (Paciulli 2004), giving a total of about 2,100 to 3,700 individuals (down from 15,000 in 1980) (Whittaker 2006). This species lives at much higher densities in logged forest than in unlogged forest, and their highest density is in forest logged 20 years ago (Whittaker 2006).

17951229,12560,Macaca sinica,Endangered,A2cd+4cd,2020,2015-11-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Although this is a widely distributed species on Sri Lanka, the population is suspected to have declined by more than 50% in the last 40 years (approximately three generations) due to habitat loss at an equal or slightly higher rate. The species is also threatened from persecution as a pest, and minimally from the pet industry<br/></p><p>More specifically, according to government data, during the 42-year period (1956-1993) the country lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 70% if the last 22 years to the present are included. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number of macaques (Dittus 1977). Since 2003 a new threat has emerged: it involves translocating animals considered pests to unsuitable habitats where macaque survival is at risk (Dittus 2012a,b). In addition, there has been a loss of at least 15% of natural habitat in the Northern Dry Zone areas, especially since the end of the war in 2009 and further losses are expected (Mattsson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The large-sized protected areas (as well as unprotected ones) in the dry and arid zones provide suitable ecological habitat in less than 2% of their areas: only along the narrow riverine forests for this water dependent species (Dittus 1977). Therefore, macaque densities in most National Parks and other remaining tracts of the dry zone forests have been estimated to be extremely low: at 0.2–0.5/km² (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, McKay 1973, Dittus 1977). Wet zone habitats (<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>) are densely populated by humans and macaques are isolated in fragmented patches and are treated as pests (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In the montane areas,&#160;<em>M. s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;is assessed here as Critically Endangered. This endemic species is threatened also by the fact that it has no legal protection but is managed as a pest species. In human-monkey conflict situations people are at liberty to kill macaque monkeys, and some commercial air-rifle sellers advertise their products with macaques as targets. The overall empirical profile for the species justifies IUCN Endangered status. Notwithstanding, the&#160;public perception of macaque numbers countrywide is highly overblown because macaques are often lured out of the forest towards refuse and crops where they are seen easily. Garbage feeding macaque populations can grow exponentially (Dittus 2012, Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). These facts, together with macaque-human conflict (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cabral <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dittus <em>et al</em>. 2019), have misled some people to question the species’ overall threatened status, and therefore poses a political challenge for conservation policy and management.&#160;</p>","The species is found in a variety of forest types (Dittus, 1977) at all altitudes up to about 2,100 m (Corbet and Hill 1992).&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">Macaca sinica aurifrons&#160;</em>is found in lowland and midland tropical rainforest and wet zone lowland forests,&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. opisthomelas&#160;</em>in montane tropical rainforest, and&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. sinica&#160;</em>in the extensive dry evergreen forest near permanent water. The species is mainly arboreal and terrestrial and diurnal. It is frugivorous, but also consumes flowers, new leaf shoots, tubers, insects, and the occasional small vertebrate. It adapts easily to human foods (Hladik and Hladik, 1972, Dittus, 1977). Its local and wider geographic distributions are limited by the availability of free water; in the dry and arid zones this means that its ecological distribution is far less than suggested by the area of occupancy in red lest assessments (Dittus, 2013).","<p>The chief threat to this species is habitat loss owing to the encroachment of plantations, and fuel wood collection. Other threats include shooting, snaring and poisoning of the animals, as they are considered to be crop pests (Dittus 2012, Molur<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country lost 50% of its forest cover and more than 50% if the last 10 years (1994-2003) are included. Over the last 15 years the rate of decline has remained the same with increasing pressures of habitat modification, forest die back, agriculture, plantations, and settlements. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. Therefore, the species is reduced numerically minimally by 50% (Dittus 2012, Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Much of the original forested habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>&#160;in the southwest rainforest areas has been converted to agriculture, home gardens and plantations. These habitats are inimical to macaque survival because the animals are not tolerated by humans (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations during the 19th century. The populatoin of <em>Macaca s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;has been reduced by &gt;80% over the last 20 years. This trend is continuing as high elevation natural forests are being converted to agriculture (vegetable plots and dairy pasture) (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Dittus 2013, Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Wickramanayake and Gunatilleke 2002, Wijesundera 2012); the subspecies is assessed as Critically Endangered. The Mahaweli Development Scheme has destroyed much dry-zone forest habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. sinica&#160;</em>(Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003) and continues to impact dry zone forests (Mattson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Jayasuriya&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). The protracted civil war in Sri Lanka has had a negative impact on habitat and wildlife in the dry zone (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also persecuted due to increasing human-wildlife negative interactions throughout the range (Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). The declines are predicted to continue for another 2-3 decades given the increasing population impacts, development schemes, lack of political will, expanding agriculture and plantations, forest die back, tourism, linear intrusions, and general lack of habitat and wildlife promoting attitudes.<br/></p>","<p>The species is widely distributed in Sri Lanka where virtually all populations inhabiting undisturbed natural forest are in decline owed to habitat loss. The three subspecies vary in the degree of old-growth habitat remaining to support population numbers and that of the montane subspecies&#160;<em>Macaca sinica opishtomelas</em>&#160;is the most threatened. Towns, tourist and temple provides macaques access to human foods and this has developed into concentrations of conspicuous pest macaques at these sites.

The generation length is approximately 13 years.</p>","<p>The major threat to this species today is habitat fragmentation, with many of these fragments being further decreased. In the past, habitat loss was due mainly to timber harvest and the creation of exotic plantations such as tea, eucalyptus and coffee. Habitat degradation seems to the biggest threat to the conservation of Lion-tailed Macaques wherever they occur in Kerala (Easa <em>et al</em>. 1997). In private forests and plantations, change in land use is a problem for the species. Hunting is a second major threat, especially in certain parts of its range. In one location, Coorg, with a large area of remaining wet evergreen habitat, the species is highly threatened by non-subsistence and subsistence hunting for food (Kumara and Singh 2004). In some areas, primate meat is preferred as food, and so the animals face serious hunting threats (Kumara and Singh 2004). A local trade exists for pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003), and in Coorg the animals were often hunted in the past for “medicinal” uses.&#160;</p><p>Certain features of the reproductive biology and ecology of this species (such as large interbirth periods, seasonal resource availability, and female competition for mating opportunities) combine to make it intrinsically rare in the wild. The populations already reduced to low numbers are in special need of active management (Singh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).&#160;Furthermore, the Lion-tailed Macaques in the fragmented forests of Anamalai Hills were found to have less genetic diversity compared to those in a more contiguous forest in Nelliyampathy, implying that genetic inbreeding due to fragmentation and isolation may have a detrimental effect on the long-term survival of small, isolated populations (Ram&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).</p><p></p>","<p>The total wild population is estimated to be about 4,000 individuals, made up of 47 isolated subpopulations in seven different locations; these subpopulations tend to be small and in forest fragments that are isolated from each other (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2006). There are estimated to be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals (Molur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Few subpopulations have the structure and habitat suitable for self-sustainment, where 10-15 groups share or connect their home ranges and interbreed. In the Sirsi-Honnavara rainforests of the northern Western Ghats in Karnataka, for instance, a subpopulation consisting of 32 groups in a contiguous tract of habitat exists where less than six groups survived 20 years prior in the early 1980s (Kumara and Singh 2004). Kumara and Singh (2008) estimated 451 individuals in 30 groups in Kudremukh forest complex. Recent sightings reported by Kumara and Sinha report of population in the following areas: one group in Makut Reserve Forest, four groups in Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary, one group in Subramanya Reserve Forest, one group in Sakaleshpur Reserve Forest, 10 groups in Kudremukh National Park. Kumara <em>et al.</em> (2011) reported a decline in habitat in Aghanashini Lion-tailed Macaque Conservation Reserve. The forests of Kerala host up to 1,216 adult lion tailed macaques, according to a large study using estimates from forest sightings (Easa <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>1997).&#160; The Anaimalai landscape support about 60 groups, though only two subpopulations there are composed of more than two groups, one has seven, the other 12 (Singh <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2002, Kumara <em>et al</em>. 2014). Overall the species is declining in forest fragments, and stable in protected areas (Molur <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, H.N. Kumara pers. comm).

There are also data available to support that this species is being displaced by rhesus macaque in northern parts of its range (Kumara&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Over its entire distribution range, the species is observed to have undergone massive declines, based on which it is estimated that the declines are over 30% in the last three generations (36-39 years) due to hunting, persecution, faulty translocations altering group compositions, road expansion, removal of native avenue trees, feeding by humans, and displacement by Rhesus macaques in the northern parts of the range.

17953422,20229,Simias concolor,Critically Endangered,A2acd,2020,2015-11-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Critically Endangered because a population decline of 80-90% over the last 36 years (three generations) is estimated due to heavy hunting pressure and extensive habitat loss (especially on southern islands but quite significant throughout species range). It has been relatively well studied and thus documentation is fairly recent and intensive (Whittaker 2006). However, there is need for further extensive research across its entire range.</p>","<p>Pig-tailed Langurs are found in swamp forests and lowland rainforests (Tenaza 1987, Quinten 2010), as well as in primary forests on the hillsides of the islands‘ interior regions (Tilson 1977); they have also been spotted in habitat mosaics of primary and secondary forest (Paciulli 2004). The species occurs sympatrically with <em>Presbytis siberu, Macaca siberu</em> and <em>Hylobates klossii</em> (<em>S. c. siberu</em> on Siberut) as well as with <em>Presbytis potenziani, Macaca pagensis</em> and <em>Hylobates klossii</em> (<em>S. c. concolor</em> on the three southern Mentawai Islands). On Siberut, the interspecific overlap of <em>Simias</em> and <em>Presbytis</em> home ranges can be up to 100 % (Hadi et al 2010). Generally, the home range size for <em>Simias</em> seems to vary considerably across the archipelago and sizes between 3 and 30 ha have been recorded at different study sites (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). The species is diurnal, semi-terrestrial, and primarily folivorous (D. Whittaker pers. comm.), feeding mainly on leaves, fruit supplements, seeds and flowers. Social organization varies and is often defined as ‘monandrous’ meaning one adult male and one or two adult female, however, multi-male, multi female groups have also been observed. Despite an early report that births were restricted to June and July (Tilson 1977), a more recent study determined that breeding in this species is not strictly seasonal (Erb et al 2012a). Pig-tailed Langurs are typically shy of humans and when alarmed, they are known to hide behind foliage but when further threatened, drop to the ground and flee.</p>","<p>This species is threatened mainly by heavy hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006, Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is also threatened by the conversion of rainforest into oil palm plantations, as well as forest clearing and product extraction by local people. Sometimes, animals are taken for the pet trade (Whittaker 2006).<br/><br/>Over the last two to three decades, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been progressively eroded due to missionary and state influences (Whittaker 2006; Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>S. concolor </em>is the preferred game species of most Mentawai hunters (Mitchell and Tilson 1986, Fuentes 2002, Paciulli 2004, Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). Tenaza (1989) estimated that twice as many individuals are killed by hunters each year as are born in the Pagai Islands. On Siberut Island, interview surveys in 50 villages revealed that 24% of the respondents were ‘active hunters’ and 77% of those respondents target <em>Simias concolor.</em> The average number hunted per three months was 1.9 and a minimum off-take of over 1,600 individuals per year (&gt;10 % of the total population) was estimated (Quinten <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2014). Hunting also appears to reduce group size, and to significantly affect adult sex ratios as well as the number of immatures in groups (Erb <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Consumption as well as cultural/ceremonial reasons were most often given as a justification for hunting the species (Quinten <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2014).<br/><br/>At present, the Pig-tailed Snub-nosed Langur is listed on the IUCN Red List (Ver 3.1) as “Critically Endangered” on the basis of criteria A2cd; this equally applies to its two subspecies, <em>S. c. concolor</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>S.c. siberu</em>. It means that the species along with its subspecies was assessed to be at an “extremely high risk of extinction” due to “(A) An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population reduction (2) of ≥80% over the last 10 years or three generations […] based on (c) a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat and (d) actual or potential levels of exploitation” (see Whittaker 2006). From its first evaluation up until the previous one in 2008,&#160;<em>Simias concolor</em>&#160;was listed as “Endangered” (IUCN 2008). Whittaker (2006) explicitly details the reasons for the upgrade to Critically Endangered in her Conservation Action Plan for the Mentawai Primates:<br/><br/>“The most recent survey of <em>Simias </em>density was conducted in the Pagai Islands, where densities ranged from 5 individuals/km² in unlogged forest to 2.5 individuals/km² in forest patches logged 20 years ago (Paciulli 2004). If about 2,700 km² of primate habitat remains in the Mentawai Islands, then there are 6,700–7,300 simakobu monkeys today, representing a decline of 33 –75% from the 1980 estimate of 19,000 simakobu monkeys in Siberut (26,000&#160;in all four Mentawai Islands). The loss may have been even greater than this estimate: more recently, the mean population density for Simias throughout the Mentawais, based on home range sizes, was estimated as 21 individuals/km² (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). Based on this density and a very conservative estimate of 3,000 km² of forest, there were 63,000 simakobus in 1994, indicating a possible loss of 73–90% of the population in 10 years. The loss is likely greater in the Pagai Islands, where logging has been more of a problem and hunting has been facilitated by logging roads, than in Siberut. The primary threat to Simias is hunting, as it is the preferred game of most Mentawai hunters (Mitchell and Tilson 1986, Fuentes 2002, Paciulli 2004). In 1990, Tenaza and Fuentes (1995) found no simakobu monkeys in a site in Siberut that had an unusually high density (~220 individuals/km²) when surveyed by Watanabe (1981) in 1974–1978. The site had been logged, and after logging had ceased, local people reported that hunting the simakobus was easier because there were fewer places for them to hide (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). This evidence of heavy hunting suggests the higher estimate of decline may be more correct.”<br/><br/>The situation for this primate, as described above by Whittaker, remains virtually unchanged until today, with hunting and habitat loss still being the main threats: Previous estimates put the entire Siberut subspecies at 6,000-15,500 individuals (Whittaker 2006), although more recent data suggest that ca. 14,112 individuals (range: 8,252-24,133) live within Siberut National Park alone, an area covering over 40 % of the northern island. At the same time, much of the area outside the park is designated production forest and agricultural area, so – with few exceptions (e.g. Peleonan Forest in N-Siberut) – it is questionable whether this species still survives in high densities outside the park. Furthermore, the hunting threat has recently been quantified for the first time, painting a somewhat bleak picture: An average annual off-take of between 1,600 and 3,200 individuals was estimated (Quinten et al<em>&#160;</em>2014), which - based on Whittaker’s estimates - would mean anything between 10 and 50 % of the population. While no recent data are available from the three southern islands, the old estimates of only 700-1,800 individuals (Whittaker 2006) are quite low, illustrating that&#160;<em>S. s. concolor</em>&#160;is urgently in need of protective measures.<br/><br/>On this basis, it is recommend that the status of&#160;<em>S. concolor</em>&#160;should be maintained as Critically Endangered, and this should apply equally to both subspecies.&#160;</p>","<p>In 2006, the population estimate for the species as a whole was 6,700–17,300 individuals, down from an estimated population of 26,000 in 1980 (Whittaker 2006). This represents a decline of 33–75% over 26 years (1980-2006). Over the last 10 years it is estimated to have undergone a further decline; it is therefore estimated that the population has declined by over 80% in 36 years (three generations).<br/><br/><strong><em>Simias concolor concolor</em></strong><strong><br/> </strong>The most recent surveys of this species estimated densities of five individuals/km² in unlogged forest, and 2.5 individuals in forest patches logged 20 years ago (Paciulli 2004). Its mean population density was estimated at 21 individuals/km² in 1994 (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). This would indicate a decline of 73 to 90% in 10 years (Whittaker 2006). Most likely, the species has been driven to extinction on two of the islets at the South of South Pagai Island (Yanuar <em>et al.</em> 1998). With its total population estimated to number only 700-1,800 individuals (Whittaker 2006), <em>S. c. concolor</em> is urgently in need of protective measures.</p><p><strong><em>Simias concolor siberu</em></strong><strong> <br/> </strong>For the Siberut subspecies, more recent studies are available, estimating this primate to live in relatively undisturbed lowland rainforest on mineral soil at densities of ca. 53.1 individuals/km² (range: 38.8–72.5), representing values comparable to adjacent peat swamp forest (Peleonan Forest, North Siberut; Waltert <em>et al.</em> 2008 and Quinten<em> et al</em>. 2010). For Siberut National Park, which covers &gt;40 % of the island’s western side, surveys in 2011/12 yielded substantially lower density estimates: 8.5 (5.0-14.5) individuals/km²; on this basis, it was estimated that <em>ca</em> 14,112 (8,252-24,133) Pig-tailed Langurs still inhabit the park (Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previously, the total population on Siberut was estimated to comprise between 6,000-15,500 individuals (Whittaker 2006), however, the more recent estimates of Quinten <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggest these numbers for Siberut National Park alone.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is endemic to Indonesia.

Whittaker (2006) suggests the following conservation actions: ""1) increased protection for Siberut National Park, which currently lacks enforcement, 2) formal protection of the Peleonan forest in North Siberut, which is home to unusually high primate populations and is easily accessible, 3) protection of areas in the Pagai Islands by cooperating with a logging corporation that has practiced sustainable logging technique there since 1971, 4) conservation education, especially regarding hunting, and 5) the development of alternative economic models for the local people to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies.""<br/><br/>Quinten <em>et al</em>. (2014) further suggest (i) lobbying the local government to ban the use and possession of air rifles throughout the archipelago, and confiscate such weapons; (ii) an island-wide campaign to emphasize cultural tradition in order to increase the hunters’ inclination to follow traditional practices and taboos, including ceremonial rather than opportunistic hunting; (iii) improving agricultural practices to decrease dependence on primates for animal protein; (iv) active inclusion of locals into conservation projects and environmental tourism ventures on Siberut as guides and field assistants who can act as multipliers for a positive conservation message in their communities. </p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Increasing hunting pressure for bushmeat and persecution as crop pests in many parts of their range are suspected to be causing a population decline. Habitat loss caused by mining, agriculture and human population growth is also a threat, but the total decline has not exceeded 30% over the past three generations (36 years).</p>","<p><em>C. sabaeus</em> occurs in riverine gallery woodlands, acacia savannas, Sahel savannas, Guinea savannas, savanna-forest mosaic, mangrove forest and at the edge of lowland tropical moist forest (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013). Temperature range is 1–57°C (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977).</p>  <p>Home ranges sizes are variable. For instance, in Saloum, Senegal, home range was reported as 138 ha (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976). In the Senegal River valley, home ranges are 157–164 ha (Galat 1983). Day range length is 2,000–8,000 m. In the Bandia Reserve, Senegal, day range can reach up to 11,000 m during the dry season, when the monkeys are searching for water (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). <em>C. sabaeus</em> is diurnal, semi-terrestrial and spends 28–61% of its time on the ground; 20–80% at 0–5 m height; 12–20% at 5–10 m; 2–8% at 10–20 m. On rare occasions, it climbs above 20 m, for example in <em>Dialium guineense</em> in Burkina Faso (Galat-Luong 1976, Galat 1983, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). Green monkeys swim readily (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976, Oates 2011, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p><em>C. sabaeus</em> occurs in multi-male/multi-female groups. In Senegal, troop size varies from 8 to 174, and large troops fission into one-male subgroups during the rainy and birth seasons (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977, Galat 1983). In Côte d’Ivoire, group size varies from 4 to 9 individuals (Galat and Galat-Luong 1980). Females of different troops guard offspring in common nurseries in large trees during daytime rest periods (Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).</p>  <p><em>C. sabaeus</em> is an opportunistic generalist omnivore (Galat <em>et al</em>. 2009). They feed on fruits (24–50%), leaves (28–50%), seeds (13%), flowers (3–13%), buds, young twigs, stems, bark and gum (11–15%), invertebrates (5–50%) and vertebrates, including birds’ eggs, birds, lizards and small mammals. Unusual food items include <em>Acacia seyal</em> thorns, fungi, bird faeces, and soil from termite mounds (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977, 1978, McGrew <em>et al</em>. 1978, Galat 1983, Harrison 1983). In the Senegal River valley, <em>C. sabaeus</em> were observed to prey upon <em>Arvicanthis niloticus</em>,<em> Streptopelia senegalensis</em>,<em> Passer griseus</em>,<em> Tockus erythrorhynchus</em>, eggs, <em>Lepus saxatilis</em>, lizards. They also dug out West African marbled lungfishes <em>Protopterus</em> <em>annectens</em> from their subterranean borrows during the dry season (Galat-Luong 1977, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Saloum mangrove, they feed on <em>Rhizophora mangle</em> aerial roots and prey upon fiddler crabs <em>Uca tangeri</em> (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976). In some locations, they crop raid and steal food from tourists (Galat 1983, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).&#160;</p>  <p>Territorial behaviour is related to habitat productivity and food availability. At sites with more than 500 mm annual rainfall, <em>C. sabaeus</em> occupies relatively small home ranges because productivity is sufficient to sustain a group in a small area. In rich environments, <em>C. sabaeus</em> live in small groups (less than 36 individual) in small home ranges (15–30 ha, with some local exceptions in less diverse habitats, such as plantations). In such conditions, a dominant male defends an exclusive territory using ritualized territorial displays. In habitats with less than 500 mm annual rainfall, food supply becomes more restricted because of low productivity and low predictability. In such poor environments, <em>C. sabaeus</em> lives in larger groups (up to 174 individuals) and has large home ranges (up to 140 ha). These home ranges are widely overlapping among groups without any territorial behaviour. Up to 300 individuals of different troops have been seen to share a large local food source simultaneously without showing any overt aggression. In smaller food patches, Galat and colleagues observed a form of queuing by subgroups (Galat 1983, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;</p><p><em>C. sabaeus</em> prefers to sleep in large tall trees with good visibility of surroundings, along riverbanks when available (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Senegal River valley, different troops may share the same sleeping trees (Galat 1983).</p><p>The natural predators of <em>C. sabaeus</em> are <em>Panthera pardus, Python sebae, Crocuta crocuta, Lycaon pictus, Pan troglodytes</em> and large eagles. <em>Caracal caracal</em>, Leptailurus serval,&#160;<em>Lupulella</em><em>&#160;adustus, Canis lupus familiaris</em> probably also prey on young green monkeys (Pruetz and Bertolani 2007, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013). Experimental exhibition of surrogates of leopards and snakes (Price and Fischer 2014) and leopards, civets and flying eagles (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016) elicits threat alarm barks and anti-predatory behaviour.</p><p><em>C. sabaeus</em>&#160;are healthy carriers of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Prevalence can reach 46% in wild populations (Galat and Galat-Luong 1997).</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Humans are major predators – <em>C. sabaeus</em> are hunted as bushmeat and killed to protect crops. Increasing hunting pressure and bushmeat traffic is affecting populations in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Sierra Leone (Ginn and Nekaris 2014, Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015). Green monkeys emit territorial loud calls at dawn and sunset, indicating the location of the whole troop (often a single large tree). This makes them easy to hunt; however, as hunting pressure increases and <em>C. sabaeus</em> density decreases, they adapt their behaviour and become quiet while dispersing into several trees, sometimes with as few as one monkey per tree. As a result, hunting becomes more difficult (A. Galat-Luong and G. Galat pers. obs. 1974–1976, 1988–2002).</p><p>There is evidence of increasing live trade as pets. In addition, they are persecuted as crop pests in many parts of their range (Wallis 2013). An exception is in Mali, where this threat is low according to Schleicher <em>et al</em>. (2014).</p>  <p>In addition to hunting pressure, habitat loss caused by mining, agriculture and human population growth are causing declines of populations across their range. For example, in Guinea, important habitat is being cleared at planned mining sites in Sangaredi (Baarman <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>There is no total population estimate for the species, but a few decades ago the combined population of Niokolo-Koba in Senegal and Comoé in Côte&#160;d'Ivoire was at least 40,000 individuals (Geerling and Bokdam 1973, Galat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997).&#160;<em>C. sabaeus</em>&#160;populations can grow rapidly under favourable conditions and have recoved quickly from high mortality in extreme habitats (Oates 2011). During harsh dry weather (temperatures up to 57°C, annual rainfall below 20 mm), reproduction can be halted (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977).</p><p>Senegal: <em>C. sabaeus</em> have been censused in two national parks. In Delta du Saloum National Park, a UNESCO MAB Reserve, the mean population size from 1998 and 2001 counts was 700 individuals. The Fathala Forest Reserve population varied from 400 to 550 individuals (mean density 5.5 individuals/km², troop size up to 33 individuals) (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976, Galat <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2002). In Niokolo-Koba National Park, the estimated mean population size from 1990 to 1995 was 28,000 individuals (Galat <em>et al</em>. 1997). Along the left bank of the Senegal River, the distribution of <em>C. sabaeus</em> is very patchy and sensitive to dry conditions.&#160;</p>  <p>Mauritania: a similar situation to that in Senegal was observed along the right bank of the Senegal River (A. Galat-Luong and G. Galat pers. obs. 1988–1996).</p>  <p>Guinea: a rapid assessment of the primate fauna conducted in 2005 in the northwestern Boké Prefecture indicated the presence of green monkeys in several localities (Eriksson and Kpoghomou 2006). Surveys conducted in the same area in 2013 confirmed that the species is relatively common in Sangaredi and Kamsar sub-prefectures, but numbers per group are low (Baarman <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p>Burkina Faso: the species has been reported in Comoé-Léraba Partial Reserve (Galat and Galat-Luong 2006, Oates 2011). Surveys conducted from May to July 2012 in the southern part of the country confirmed its presence in Comoé-Léraba Partial Reserve, and in Koulbi, and Nazinga Forests although at low encounter rates (0.02–0.10 groups/km) (Ginn and Nekaris 2014). The presence of <em>C. sabaeus</em> in these forests was corroborated by Haus <em>et al</em>. (2013) using mitochondrial DNA sequencing.</p>  <p>Côte d'Ivoire: in Comoé National Park, Geerling and Bokdam (1973) estimated 1.4 individuals/km². Of 195 encounters with groups of primates in Comoé National Park (1980–1986), 7% were with <em>C. sabaeus</em>, ranking 6th of nine monkey species. Outside Comoé National Park, of 235 encounters with groups of primates made in the geographic range of <em>C. sabaeus</em>, 7% were with <em>C. sabaeus</em>, ranking 4th of 14 species (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). Kadjo <em>et al</em>. (2014) encountered the species at a rate of 0.51 group/km during a 2006 survey in Marahoué National Park. However, more recent surveys in that park failed to reconfirm its presence (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Cape Verde Islands: <em>C. sabaeus</em> are found on both Santiago and Brava islands. Their numbers are likely smaller now than they were in the past (Hazevoet and Masseti 2011).</p>  <p>Mali: Schleicher <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that <em>C. sabaeus</em> is relatively common in several localities in the Bafing protected areas in the southwest of the country. Pavy (1993) estimated a density of 1.2 individuals/km².</p>",Decreasing,"<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The geographic area over which <em>Chlorocebus sabaeus</em> occurs is <em>ca</em> 1,000,000 km² (Galat and Galat-Luong 2013). The species ranges from Senegal, with the westernmost limit at Mbao and Dakar (Galat and Galat-Luong 2013), and Guinea-Bissau to west of the Nakambe/Volta River system in Burkina Faso and Ghana. It has been recorded from the Bijagos archipelago in Guinea Bissau (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003). In Côte d’Ivoire, the species is distributed mainly through the savanna and savanna-forest mosaic habitats north of the rainforest zone (Galat and Galat-Luong 1980). They were also reported from the forest zone of southern Côte d’Ivoire outside its expected range at the edge of the Ebrié Laguna near Jacqueville (Galat 1983), and in Ile Ehotilé National Park (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2009); however, it is not clear whether their occurrence here is natural or from introduction by humans.

Their preferred forest type varies geographically. They often show a preference for gallery forest (Nakagawa 1999), but they are found in dry woodlands in northern Nigeria, and montane forests in southern Nigeria.</p>  <p>This species is extremely adaptable, residing in degraded habitats or forest edges (e.g., in Togo and Bénin; Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008), and is found in both rural and urban environments (Wallis 2013). It lives sympatrically with Patas Monkeys (<em>Erythrocebus patas</em>) in much of their range (Nakagawa 1999, 2000).&#160;</p>  <p>As with other members of their genus, Tantalus Monkeys have an omnivorous diet, feeding on leaves, fruits, seeds, flowers, gums, birds’ eggs, invertebrates (including insects), and some small vertebrates (Nakagawa 2000). They spend 20–25% of their time feeding, but this varies by season and location of study (Nakagawa 1999).</p>  <p>Although they can feed high in the trees, much of their feeding takes place on or near the ground (Kavanagh 1978). In fact, Tantalus Monkeys are largely terrestrial and can travel long distances while foraging of approximately 2,500 m per day (Nakagawa 1999). They are key seed dispersers, playing an important role in forest regeneration of their habitats; some disperse seeds as far as 1–5 km from the parent tree (Agmen <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>","<p><em>Chlorocebus tantalus</em> is common and highly adaptable over its range. There are presumed to be no major predatory threats. As with others in their genus, the Tantalus Monkey’s affinity for crop-raiding can result in frequent human-wildlife conflict, which impacts their numbers in some locations. However, because they often live near Patas Monkeys or Olive Baboons (<em>Papio anubis</em>), both of which are larger and bolder in their crop-raiding efforts, the Tantalus Monkey may often escape blame (and persecution). As mentioned, hunting Tantalus Monkeys for their meat by humans is not widely reported, perhaps due to their relatively small size, although Hema et al. (2019) found the species for sale as part of their bushmeat survey in Burkina Faso.&#160;</p>  <p>Occasionally, these monkeys become ensnared by traps set for other wildlife in their habitat or struck by vehicles on roads (Wallis pers. obs. 2009 in Uganda).&#160;</p>  <p>With widespread habitat depletion and forecasts for dramatic ecosystem responses to climate conditions reported for parts of Africa (e.g., Ponce-Reyes <em>et al</em>. 2017), the Tantalus Monkey may eventually face increasing challenges due to climate change. Thus, their numbers should be monitored, and further study of their distribution is recommended.</p>","<p><em>C. tantalus</em> is a common species, widely distributed in various habitat types. Alhough very few population density estimates are available, some recent reports from interviews and surveys indicate a decreasing population when compared with historical accounts (Ginn and Nekaris 2014). In some locations, they may be at risk due to human-wildlife conflict caused by crop-raiding (Wallis pers. obs. 2005–2009 in Nigeria, 2009 in Uganda). Overall, however, the population appears to be stable and may even be increasing in some areas where forest clearance provides more suitable habitat (see Habitats and Ecology section).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Tantalus Monkey occurs widely across Africa. It ranges from eastern Burkina Faso and east of the Volta River system in Ghana (recorded from Accra Plain and Salaga) eastward to Sudan (Imatong Mountains in the south to Jebel Marra in the north), South Sudan, and much of Uganda.

It should be noted that the taxonomic status of the species and subspecies of <em>Chlorocebus</em> is complex and needs further phenotypic study. Butynski and de Jong (2017) report that <em>C. tantalus, C. aethiops </em>and<em> C. pygerythrus</em> occur in extensive phenotypic clines in parts of northwest Kenya and northeast Uganda.

Presently, its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals with a continuing decline.","<p><span class=""None"">This species is presently restricted to limestone karst forest habitat with broadleaf evergreen forests, but with some records from secondary forest in limestone areas as well (Nadler 1996, 2004, 2015; Rowe 1996). <br/><br/>They prefer the karst habitat for several reasons, one being the bowl-like surface of karst habitats that retain rain water. They thrive in such habitats where caves and crevices offer warm shelter during cold winters. They mostly occur in lower elevations of <em>ca</em> 500 m up to 1,000 m asl in Pu Luong Nature Reserve. <br/><br/>Leaves make up most of the diet (80%) therefore they are primarily folivorous, of which 60% constitutes young leaves and 20% mature leaves. They do not eat insects and the leaves those are preferred contain a high protein to fibre ratio (Workman 2010a, 2010b; Workman and Le Van Dung 2009).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>Sexual maturity in male Delacours <em>ca</em> 5 years and females at 4 years.

In such cases the males are relatives (either father-son or brothers). Typical group size is 10 but the largest group observed is 17 individuals. Bachelor groups of up to four individuals also exist. Inter-group aggression is common and home ranges of groups overlap.</span></p>","<span class=""None"">Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behavior of the animals (Nadler 2004, 2014). The smallest populations are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as the species occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas.","<p><span class=""None"">Surveys carried out between 1990 and 2000 resulted in the discovery of 19 subpopulations in a restricted area of northern Viet Nam. Taken from these surveys the total of all populations was estimated at 49-53 groups and 270-302 individuals. In three areas where Delacour’s langur occurred in the past the species was already eradicated by the 1990s, following information provided by local people (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). About half of all discovered populations (10) occurred in unprotected areas. The protection level in protected areas is mostly low, but still under control of the Forest Protection Department. In unprotected areas there is no control over hunting, and the animals are under high pressure.<br/><br/>With additional surveys in the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century the total number of recorded individuals increased slightly. The number of groups is 50-57 and the number of individuals 281-317. The increased total number of langurs resulted in the development of the population in Van Long Nature Reserve, the area under special protection through the Vietnam Primate Conservation Program of Frankfurt Zoological Society, which included additional education and awareness programs for the surrounding communes of the area. The distribution of animals within subpopulations during this period indicates a reduction in the occurrence of larger populations compared to the previous decade (Nadler 2004; 2015). During this decade a number of small populations were eradicated. The exact years of extirpation cannot be verified. The information is based on interview surveys of local villagers, who indicated that the last sighting or record of the species was often several years ago. Therefore, these small populations are believed to be eradicated.<br/><br/>Surveys were carried out between 2012 and 2015 by the Endangered Primate Rescue Center and Forestry University Hanoi to verify the current situation of the species. The results of the surveys in all known subpopulations shows a dramatic decline compared to the last decade. The total number is estimated at 234-275 individuals. The majority occurs in Van Long Nature Reserve and if the population of the nature reserve is combined with the adjacent planned extension area to count as one population, the total for the area is 164-191 individuals. The remaining 70-84 individuals occur in the additional seven areas. Not one of these populations has a size which can guarantee a secure future, even if hunting could be eliminated. The problem of inbreeding for these small populations is not relevant. Before the inbreeding coefficient increases over a certain level, the populations will be extinct through other pressures.<span class=""None""><br/><br/>The results of the surveys clearly illustrate the dire situation for the species and the extreme value of Van Long Nature Reserve as the last and only refuge for the survival of the species.</span></p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Viet Nam and occurs in a very restricted area of north-central Viet Nam that totals about 5,000 km². The distribution of subpopulations and smaller social groups is closely related to the series of limestone mountain ranges in the provinces of Ninh Binh, Nam Ha, Hoa Binh, and Thanh Hoa (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2004, 2015; Nadler and Brockman 2014). The area of occupancy (AOO) for this species prior to 2000 was only about 400 km² but with eradication of several populations the AOO is currently smaller than 300 km² (Nadler 2015).","The species is hunted primarily for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"", but also for food and occasionally for the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""None"">This species is currently listed in CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'critically endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed under the highest protection level in Decree 32/2006, and as species for special conservation considerations in Decree 160/2013. It occurs in six protected areas. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for conservation of this species in 2001, and there has been evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past 15 years.<br/><br/>The primary focus of conservation activities for the species should be the protection of all remaining populations. But this is far from the reality. The protection of areas without current protection status - which are three areas - is not feasible. To apply for a protection status and establish strong protection for an area is not a viable option for such extremely small populations with little chance of ever developing into viable populations. These populations will be eradicated and disappear in the near future. The most efficient option to stabilize the largest existing population in Van Long Nature reserve and to save sufficient habitat for the long-term existence of a viable population would be the extension of the reserve. <br/><br/>Translocation of isolated groups of animals or small populations from areas under pressure or for improving the genetic pool of a larger population is undoubtedly an important conservation tool for many species. The most critical point is the method with which to catch the animals in the areas which are often very difficult to access. One way is netting of the animals in a cave, a sleeping place which the animals occasionally or preferentially use in the winter season. Special caves and cracks in the limestone outcrops are often used consistently by generations of animals in one group. But groups which use easily accessible caves are as a consequence of easy access, are already wiped out by hunters and the remaining sleeping places are very difficult to access. Currently, there is no other proven technique for capturing animals in the difficult terrain that constitutes their natural habitat. A well-trained team with substantial financial and technical support would be necessary to develop a technique to safely capture animals in the wild.<br/><br/>A basis for reintroduction is the captive population of Delacour’s langur at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center. In 2011 a first pilot project was conducted with the reintroduction of three captive born individuals into Van Long Nature Reserve (Agmen 2014, Nadler 2012). Based on the successful result a second reintroduction took place in November 2012, also in Van Long Nature Reserve (Elser 2013, Elser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The programs have been very positively received by villagers and the awareness about protection of the species in the communes surrounding the nature reserve is very high. This has resulted in the long-term success of the Frankfurt Zoological Society conservation project and the strong involvement of local villagers and guards of the community protection unit in protection and conservation activities (Elser and Nguyen Hong Chung 2013).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>From a conservation point of view, the establishment of a second population would be a preferable option in order to secure the long-term existence of the species. With a search of possible areas, only the newly nominated World Heritage Site “Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex” could provide a suitable habitat for a newly established population, and this is in planning.</span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Other threats facing these populations include pollution, inbreeding, and a local trade in the animals for zoos and as food (Molur <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003).

Indeed, in northern Thailand they have been nearly entirely hunted out, and now only survive in larger protected areas. In the known Lao PDR stronghold for this species (Bolikhamsai province), there is extensive infrastructure development for hydro-electric power, which is likely to increase hunting pressure on these populations (R.

They can tolerate disturbed habitat, but are known to prefer floristically-rich patches of forest. Their diet is composed mainly of fruit (61%) and leaves (38%), and, to a lesser degree, flowers and insects. In captivity, the average age at first birth was 8.8 years and inter-birth intervals were about 2.3 years (Gates 1998).

A significant portion of hunting activity supplies young animals for the pet trade. The extirpation of at least seven former sub-populations has been documented (Asquith <em>et al</em>. 1995) and recent studies of three of the four largest remaining populations (Ujung Kulon NP, Haliman-Salak NP and the Dieng Mountains) suggest high probabilities of extinction within a 100-year period if current conditions do not change, or if they worsen (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/></p>","<p>From 1994-2002, Nijman (2004) assessed the entirety of the silvery gibbon’s population in its known areas of occurrence by using fixed-point counts and forest transect walks, as well as by a review of literature. Their presence was detected by listening for gibbon song and affirmed by local park officers and residents. Over 95% of the gibbons are in populations of more than 100 individuals, and the four largest areas support populations of more than 500 individuals each. Asquith<em> et al</em>. (1995) reported that, in 1995, nine local populations had gone extinct, though Nijman found two of these localities to still harbor silvery gibbons. This is attributed to the effects of habitat disturbance and low population density on calling frequency, and suggests an under-representation of gibbon abundance and number of remaining populations (Nijman 2004). Recent studies of three of the four largest remaining populations -  Ujung Kulon NP, Haliman-Salak NP and the Dieng Mountains - suggest high  probabilities of extinction within a 100-year period if current  conditions do not change, or if they worsen (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Median population density ranges are 2.7 groups/km<sup>2</sup> or 9.0 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in lowland forest (below 500 m), 2.6 groups/km<sup>2</sup> or 8.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> for hill forest (500-1,000 m), and 0.6 groups/km<sup>2</sup> or 1.5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> for lower montane forest (1000-1,750 m) (Iskandar 2007, Setiawan <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Hylobates moloch</em> is endemic to Java (Indonesia).

The reduction is driven by a corresponding loss of suitable habitat (that has averaged 1% annually in Borneo over the past 30 years) and is expected to continue at that rate (or higher) for the next 10 to 20 years, as well as by significant losses due to hunting and live capture for the pet trade.","<p>The species inhabits a range of primary, secondary and selectively logged tropical evergreen forest types (<em></em>Cheyne 2010, Cheney <em>et al</em>. 2016, Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2010, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009)<em></em>. Peat swamp forest is a particularly important forest type for <em>H. albibarbis</em> (Cheyney 2008, 2010; Cheyney <em>et al.</em> 2008). <em></em><em></em><em></em> Population densities are correlated with forest structure (Hamard <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cheyne<em> et al.</em> 2016, Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2014), altitude (Marshall 2009), and the abundance of important fallback foods (Marshall and Leighton 2006). The species appears able to adapt to low to moderate levels of selective logging, although additional studies are needed to characterize the extent of their tolerance of forest degradation (Cheyne <em>et al.</em> 2013, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><em>Hylobates albibarbis</em> is chiefly arboreal and diurnal. The species is socially monogamous and highly territorial (Mitani 1987); estimates of territory size are 47 ha at Sabangau (Cheyne 2010) and 30-43 ha at Gunung Palung (Mitani 1990; Marshall 2004). The taxon is predominantly frugivorous, preferring ripe, sugar-rich fruits (Cheyne 2008, Cheyne <em>et al.</em> 2016, Dillis <em>et al</em>. 2014, McConkey 2000, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2018) <em></em><em></em> although unripe fruits, immature leaves, insects, and flowers are consumed during periods of low fruit abundance (Coiner-Collier <em>et al</em>. 2016, McConkey 1999<em></em>).</p>","<p><em>Hylobates albibarbis</em> is threatened by habitat loss within peat swamp ecosytems due to the expansion of agricultural plantations, clear-felling for timber and, to a lesser extent, selective logging, all of which are exacerbated by forest fires associated with El Niño events (Oka<em> et al</em>. 2000, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2014; Bartlett 2007, Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2007, Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2015; Struebig <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2016). Illegal hunting and live capture for the pet trade pose additional threats (Nijman 2005). Between 1973 and 2017, Borneo (overall) has lost an average of 1% of its forest cover annually (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018), and the most recent Global Forest Watch data indicates this rate continues. If conditions do not change, a loss of close to 50% of suitable habitat can be anticipated over the course of three generations (45 years).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of the total number of individuals remaining, although the species is generally common in suitable habitat. A tentative estimate based on surveys from 2005-2018 suggests a population size of 22,000 individuals within the mixed-swamp forests in Sabangau, representing one of the largest remaining populations of this species (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2016; Cheyne 2010, Hamard <em>et al.</em> 2010). Population density estimates in undisturbed habitats range widely among forest types, from less than 0.5 individuals/km<sup><span lang=""ES-TRAD"">2</sup> in montane forests to more than 10 individuals/km<sup><span lang=""ES-TRAD"">2</span></sup> in lowland and swamp forests (Marshall 2004, 2009, 2010; Marshall and Leighton 2006). Lowland and peat swamp forests support high densities and population abundance declines predictably with altitude (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2016; Marshall 2004, 2009, 2010; Marshall and Leighton 2006). Long term monitoring in Gunung Palung National Park suggests that upland forests are of insufficient quality to maintain viable gibbon populations in the absence of inputs from lowland source forests (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2009). Population density appears to be highly stable in the absence of hunting or habitat degradation (Marshall <em><span lang=""ES-TRAD"">et al.</em> 2014), presumably due to the slow life histories and low infant and juvenile mortality in this taxon (Mitani 1990, Marshall 2009, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009).

The species as a whole is found in northern Sumatra (Indonesia), throughout Peninsular Malaysia (except for a narrow strip between the Perak and Mudah Rivers, where <em>H. agilis</em> occurs), north through southern and eastern Myanmar (east of the Salween River), most of Thailand (though not in the north-east; Marshall <em>et al</em>. 1972), and marginally into southern China, though now extirpated there (Grueter <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>No population estimates are currently available for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar (Ellefson 1974; Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). While for Lao PDR, there are no reliable estimates, but for Nam Poyi National Protected Area (which is the only protected area from which they are recorded; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995), the species is uncommon to rare, perhaps numbering in the mid- to high-hundreds (Boonratana 1997; Boonratana <em>et al</em>. 2011; Geissmann 1991). In some parts of Thailand there are several populations where numbers are at least in the thousands, though in northern Thailand they are now very rare. The largest population is in Kaeng Krachan National Park, which probably has on the order of 3,000-4,000 individuals. The Western Forest Complex may well have on the order of 10,000 animals, and likely upwards of 1,000 survive in the western part of Khao Yai National Park, as well as in Phukhieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Nam Nao National Park. <br/><br/>The major threat to this species is hunting (having replaced forest clearance as the top threat); they are hunted both for subsistence food use and for the pet trade (Bartlett, 2007; Malone <em>et al</em>. 2001; Osterberg, <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Hunting pressure varies across the range but takes place even within protected areas. Much of the hunting is done by villagers exploiting <em>Aquilaria</em> spp. trees prized for their aromatic wood, and other forest products (W. Brockelman pers. comm.). Over the coming 45 years, this decline is suspected to reach similar proportions due to continuing habitat loss, fragmentation and the impacts of wildlife trade on this species.</p>","<p>This species is found in evergreen, semi-evergreen, and mixed evergreen-deciduous forest (sometimes known as ""dry evergreen"" forest, in the northern parts of its range), and is known to utilize regenerating secondary forest and selectively logged forest (Johns 1985). In northwestern Thailand, white-handed gibbons utilize patches of dry evergreen, mixed deciduous, and bamboo forest near Karen settlements if they are not hunted. This is predominantly a lowland species (below 1,000-1,500 m).<br/> <br/> Like most other species of gibbon, <em>H. lar</em> consumes a largely frugivorous diet that includes mainly figs, as well as young shoots, leaves, some flowers, and insects. Gibbons, unlike most macaques and leaf monkeys that often share their habitats, swallow nearly all the seeds that they ingest, making them potentially important as seed dispersers. Certain species of fruits that require the consumer to remove a tough outer cover appear to rely almost entirely on gibbons for seed dispersal (Bartlett 2007; Ellefson 1974; Gittins and Raemakers 1980; MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1978; Palombit 1992, 1997; Ungar 1995). <br/><br/>Generation length in white-handed gibbons is on the order of 15 years. They mature late, with females maturing at 8-10 years and males at 8-12 years and have one offspring every 3 to 5 years (Brockelman <em>et al</em>. 1998). If a female loses a baby, she may come into oestrus sooner, but the average inter-birth interval in a population at carrying capacity is about 3.5 years (W. Brockelman pers. comm.). Average group size in <em>H. lar</em> generally increases with latitude, illustrating that group size is not a very useful species-specific character in gibbons. This reflects a general trend of increasing birth rate with latitude found in many vertebrate groups. Average group size has been reported at 2.7 (Chivers 1978) and 3.3 (Ellefson 1974) individuals in Peninsular Malaysia, 3.7 in central Thailand (Brockelman and Srikosamatara 1993), and 4.4 (Carpenter 1940) and 4.9 (Yimkao and Srikosamatar 2006) in northern Thailand. The average home range sizes are 44-54 ha on the Malayan peninsula (Ellefson 1974, Gittins and Raemaekers 1980, MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980) and about 16 ha in the Khao Yai National Park in Thailand (Chivers 1984a,b).</p>","<p>The major threat to this species is hunting (having replaced even forest clearance as the top threat); they are hunted both for subsistence food use and for the pet trade (Bartlett 2007, Malone <em>et al</em>. 2001, Osterberg <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Hunting pressure varies across the range but takes place even within protected areas. Much of the hunting is done by villagers exploiting <em>Aquilaria</em> spp. trees prized for their aromatic wood, and other forest products (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> Construction of roads through protected areas (for example, the Security Highway through Nam Poyi in Lao PDR, the north-south highway in Peninsular Malaysia) may also pose a threat since it promotes forest clearance and strip development, possibly increases fragmentation, and increases access by hunters into protected areas. Ongoing localized forest loss due to shifting agriculture and commercial plantations of palm oil poses a threat. On northern Sumatra, most of the lowland forests have been logged out and the threat of Ladia Galaskar, a network to link the west and east coasts of Aceh province, means that much of the remaining forest is at risk.</p>","<p>Population densities for this species range from 2.4 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Ketambe, Sumatra (Palombit 1992) to 0.7-2.6 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Kuala Lompat and Tanjong Triang on the Malayan peninsula (Bartlett 2007, Ellefson 1968, 1974; MacKinnon 1977, MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1978) to 6.5 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (Bartlett 2009, Reichard and Barelli 2008, Reichard 2009). A few smaller, fragmented populations survive in southern Peninsular Thailand and northwestern Malaysia, perhaps together numbering in the low thousands. There are no recent estimates of the populations in the Tenasserim section of Myanmar, northern Sumatra and in southern Peninsular Malaysia (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> In China, during the 1960s, there were estimated to be 200 individuals on both sides of the Nangunhe River. In 1988, the date of last sighting, it was estimated that there were less than 10 groups. And in 1992, the last survey date, the authors did not find any direct evidence for the species' persistence but estimated that three groups may remain with about 10 individuals in total.

The range formerly extended into southeastern Thailand, where it was parapatric with <em>H. pileatus</em> (Brockelman 1978, Brockelman and Gittins 1984, Phoonjampa and Brockelman 2008).

However, in most countries, these areas are not well patrolled, even if they are well managed for tourism. There is an urgent need for improved protection of these areas, ideally involving local communities that should benefit from as well as participate in management. Illegal use of forest products, as well as poaching, is common in most protected areas. Inadequate management and protection, rather than forest destruction, are the main long-term threats and conservation efforts must seek to identify the hunters and incorporate them into new management priorities.<em><br/> </em><em></em>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The population reduction is due to widespread local hunting for cultural reasons and loss of habitat, particularly in North Pagai, South Pagai and Sipora Islands.","<p>This species is arboreal, diurnal, and omnivorous, though predominantly frugivorous (Whitten 1982a). Although disturbance levels in this species' habitat are variable on different islands, a recent survey detected similar population densities in un-logged forests, forests logged 10 years ago, and those logged 20 years ago (Paciulli 2004, Whittaker 2005).<br/><br/>Gibbons in the Siberut area studied by both Tenaza (1974, 1975) and Tilson (1980) had unusually small average home ranges of 7-11 ha. A gibbon group studied in a different area on Siberut had a home range size of 32 ha, similar to that in other species of the genus <em>Hylobates</em> (Whitten 1980, 1982b).<br/><br/>Primarily occurs in deciduous, monsoon, tropical evergreen forests at all elevations. This species prefers the upper canopy and is also known to dwell in swamp forests. Annual rainfall in these forests are up to 4,000 mm. Primarily frugivorous, fruits make up 73% of their feeding time while insects and arthropods are consumed about 25% of the time. Breeding happens through the year with single births. Average daily movement is around 1,514 m and groups are typically composed of 4-6 individuals.</p>","<p>This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006). It is also threatened by conversion to oil palm plantations, in addition to forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). A recent study shows that habitat loss in the Mentawai islands was mainly due to forest conversion for agriculture expansion by local communities. A total of 73,500 ha of forest in Siberut, North Pagai, South Pagai and Sipora Islands have been allocated for oil palm plantation by the local government and about 34,000 ha (46%) was granted to only two companies (FFI, unpublished report)<br/><br/>Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of increased access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos which formerly regulated hunting have been eroded by brands of Christianity which have not recognised the conservation imperative (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Although this may be a greater threat to this species than to other gibbons (D. Whittaker pers. comm.), it is rarely seen in the pet-trade in Java (Nijman 2005). A recent report (Quinten <em>et </em><em>al.</em>&#160;2014) suggests Kloss’s gibbons to be rarely hunted. The Kloss’s Gibbons of Paelonan forests of Siberut Island are reported to exhibit ‘decoy’ behavior, wherein one member of the troop distracts the incumbent human danger while the rest of the troop escape. This is seen as an effective behavioral trait to escape human predation (Dooley and Judge 2014).<br/><br/>The extent of the threats from logging, hunting, and the pet trade faced by this species varies depending on location. The very large population in Siberut National Park, on central Siberut, lives in a protected area but is subject to moderate hunting pressure from local people. In the Peleonan forest, northern Siberut, the habitat was logged 20 years prior but faces low hunting pressure. This area is significant because four of the endemic Mentawai primates (<em>H. klossii, Simias concolor, Presbytis potenzian</em>i and&#160;<em>Macaca siberu</em>) exist here in high densities. Populations in Saureinu, Sipora are subject to traditional use by locals but limited logging. In South Pagai, forest plots are selectively logged but there is high hunting pressure. Animals on North Pagai were not censused, but logging and hunting occurs there as well (Whittaker 2005b).</p>","John and Kathy Mackinnon (1984, 1986) estimated the total population of <em>Hylobates klossii</em> to be 36,000 individuals. Whittaker (2005) revised this estimate to 20,000-25,000 animals nearly 20 years later. More recently, Hoing <em>et al</em>. (2013) gathered population estimates on all four Mentawai Islands (Siberut, Sipora, North Pagai and South Pagai) using loud-call monitoring and forested area estimates to census the animals. Throughout the Mentawai Islands, density averaged 12 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>. The largest population (~10,500 individuals; 3.67-6.5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) is found in Siberut National Park and represents 72.21% of the island’s population. The smallest remaining population is that found on Sipora, comprising 753-880 individuals (Paciulli 2005, Höing <em>et al</em>. 2013). The combined populations on North and South Pagai are estimated at 2,029 individuals (Paciulli 2005,&#160;Höing&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).

Whittaker (2005b, 2006) suggested the following conservation actions: 1) increased protection for Siberut National Park, which currently lacks enforcement, 2) formal protection of the Peleonan forest in North Siberut, which is home to unusually high primate populations and is easily accessible, 3) protection of areas in the Pagai Islands by cooperating with a logging corporation that has practiced sustainable logging technique there since 1971, 4) conservation education, especially regarding hunting, and 5) the development of alternative economic models for the local people to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies (Whittaker 2006).<br/><br/>The more recent Workshop of the National Strategic and Action Plan for the Conservation of the Kloss’s Gibbons which involved participants from the central and local governments, local governments, scientists and academicians, NGOs, protected area managers and private sector, outlined several key strategies and conservation issues, including:<br/><br/>1) <em><u>Spatial planning</u></em>: avoid infrastructure development within the Kloss’s gibbon habitats, identify and map priority Kloss’s gibbon habitats, protection of the remaining Kloss’s gibbon habitats outside the Siberut NP, incorporate the Kloss’s gibbon strategic and action plan into the spatial planning.<br/><br/>2) <em><u>Concessions</u></em>: identify and map Kloss’s gibbon distribution within concessions, implement robust monitoring protocol for Kloss’s gibbon population within the concessions, designate and protect Kloss’s gibbon habitats and corridors within the concessions, implement SMART patrol system within the concessions.<br/><br/>3) <em><u>Kloss</u></em><em><u>’s gibbon population and ecology</u></em>: develop standardized robust monitoring protocol for Kloss’s gibbon population and consistently implement it across the remaining populations and habitats, define and designate centers for Kloss’s gibbon ecological researches, habitat restoration and rehabilitation, and habitat enrichments.<br/><br/>4) <em><u>Community awareness and education</u></em>: implement conservation campaign and awareness programs, appoint Kloss’s gibbon ambassador, develop and implement Kloss’s gibbon conservation award programs.<br/><br/>5) <em><u>Law enforcement</u></em>: implement SMART patrol system in the protected areas, implement road block patrols, work with seaport authorities to prevent and strengthen law enforcement against illegal trade of the Kloss’s gibbons, establish a community-supported investigation network, and establish and operate a network of guard posts at optimum check point locations.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This is inferred from work on sympatric Sumatran orangutans (Campbell-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gaveau et <em>al</em>. 2009, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016), mainly as a result of expanding agriculture, land clearance through fire, and road building, calculated to be over 50% over the past 45 years (approximately 3 generations), in combination with poaching and illegal trade for the pet market (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2015, O'Brien and Kinnaird 2011, Sultan <em>et al</em>. 2009). In some areas of the species' Sumatran range, humans opportunistically hunt agile gibbons for consumption (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015, Gittins 1983, Gittins and Raemakers 1980, Lee <em>et al</em>. 2015). Threats are occurring primarily in the Sumatran portion of its range where the species seems to be declining rapidly and is certainly endangered. On the mainland (Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand), there seem to be a number of stable populations, but the range is contracting. The species is entirely confined to closed canopy forest, and thus, habitat conversion, road building and fragmentation are increasingly threatening the species (Gittins 1983, Gittins and Raemakers 1980, Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>","<p>This species occurs at highest densities in dipterocarp-dominated forests, but their known habitat ranges from swamp and lowland forests to hill, submontane, and montane forests (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004; Yanuar 2009). Additionally, populations in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Sumatra do not seem to avoid forest edges near human habitations (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004), a behavior that has also been observed in the Batang Toru Forest Complex, North Sumatra, Indonesia (Nowak pers. obs.). While they prefer undisturbed primary forest, some studies from Sumatra indicate that they can also be found in previously disturbed regenerating forest (Sultan <em>et al.</em> 2009; Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015). In southern Sumatra, populations were found up to 1,400 meters (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>These arboreal and diurnal primates are primarily frugivorous (preferring fruits high in sugar, such as figs), but they will consume flowers, immature leaves, and insects as well (Gittins 1979, 1982). An average home range size of 29 ha has been determined in a study at Sungai Dal (Gunung Bubu Forest Reserve) on the Malayan peninsula (Gittins 1979, 1982; Gittins and Raemaekers 1980), whereas a study from within and in areas surrounding Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia has documented average home ranges of 22.5 ha in forest fragments and 24.7 ha in more continuous forested areas (Yanuar and Chivers 2010). Within the submontane forests of the Batang Toru Forest Complex, agile gibbons have been documented to have home ranges over 50 ha (Nowak pers. obs.).&#160; <br/><br/>Wild gibbons from the genus <em>Hylobates</em> are known to have relatively slow life histories, including a late age at first reproduction (8-12 years) and long interbirth interval (2.2-3.8 years) (Palombit, 1995; Reichard and Barelli, 2008; O’Brien and Kinnaird 2011). Recent work by O’Brien and Kinnaird (2011) has also shown that agile gibbons in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park have extremely low birth (0.22-0.28 infants female<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and infant to juvenile survival rates (33.3%), which they suggest is related to increased resource competition with larger and more abundant sympatric species (e.g. siamangs).</p>","<p>On Sumatra, this species is threatened by forest conversion, mining, road construction, human encroachment, and a subsequent opportunistic capture for the pet trade and in some areas human consumption. These threats extend to populations within national parks and forests, including illegal agricultural and road development inside designated conservation areas. Between 1985 and 2007 on Sumatra, nearly 50% of the conceivable habitat for this species was lost to logging, road development, and conversion to agriculture or plantations (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2015<em></em>). Forests, where they remain, are extremely fragmented (Estrada <em>et al. </em>2017). Agricultural expansion (e.g., coffee, oil palm, and rubber), in addition to the expansion of pulp-paper and sawn-timber plantations, are currently the main drivers of forest loss on Sumatra (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003<em></em>). A recent report indicates that agile gibbons are often encountered in Indonesian wildlife markets and are a common species entering the Kalaweit rehabilitation center in Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The species' status in Malaysia is more uncertain, however, as with Sumatra, oil palm expansion has been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia (Miyamoto <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Thailand there is extensive conversion of forests to rubber plantations and other crops (even inside protected areas), as well as hunting for the pet trade.</p>","<p>O'Brien<em> </em>and Kinnaird (2011) performed a population assessment in 2002 on agile gibbons in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia, which is one of the larger and most contiguous protected forest blocks remaining within their current distribution. Using calling counts in both forest edge and interior habitats, and basing their estimate on forest cover area in the park, they calculated a population of 4,479 agile gibbons (CV = 30%) (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004). Other key forested areas for Sumatran agile gibbons include Berbak, Bukit Tiga Puluh, Kerinci Seblat, Sembilng, and Way Kambas National Parks, in addition to Bukit Rimbang Bukit Baling Wildlife Reserve. In Peninsular Malaysia, the Belum, Selama, and Ulu Muda Wildlife Reserves are strongholds. Portions of the population in Thailand likely number a few thousand individuals, located in approximately four forest fragments, including the Bang Lang, Budi-Sungai Padi, and Namtok Sipo National Parks, and Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Density estimates for this species range from 1.4-2.8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Bukit Barisan Seletan (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004), 8.8-15.5 individual/km<sup>2</sup> in Batang Gadis National Park (Sultan <em>et al.</em> 2009), 6.3-13.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Harapan Rainforest (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015), 6.0-11.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Kerinci-Seblat (Yanuar 2009), and 1.9 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Way Kambas to 5.5-18.9 individuals (2-5 groups)/km<sup>2</sup> in Sungai Dal on the Malay peninsula (Gittins 1979). Surveys in southern Thailand reveal the density to be 1.1-3.3 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in parts of Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary (Nongkaew 2010). The density estimates from both Batang Gadis National Park and Harapan Rainforest are particularly interesting as they indicate that Sumatran agile gibbons can occur at relatively high densities in previously degraded regenerating forests.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Sumatra, Indonesia (southeast of Lake Toba and the Singkil River), Peninsular Malaysia (from the Mudah and Thepha Rivers in the north to the Perak and Kelanton Rivers in the south) and south Thailand (near the Malaysian border, east of the Thepha River watershed) (Gittins 1979; Groves 2001; Marshall and Sugardjito 1986; Sultan <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","The species is opportunistically captured for the pet trade and, in some areas, for human consumption.",Terrestrial,"<p>Agile gibbons are protected throughout their range by local laws, whereas all international commercial trade is prohibited through its listing on CITES Appendix I. The extent to which national or international laws actually protect the species is uncertain.<br/><br/>The species occurs in a number of protected areas, including Berbak National Park, Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Bukit Tiga Puluh National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sembilang National Park, and Way Kambas National Park in Indonesia; Belum, Selama, and Ulu Mudah Wildlife Reserves in Malaysia; and Bang Lang National Park, Budo-Sungai Padi National Park, Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary, and Namtok Sipo National Park in Thailand. Unfortunately, many of these are merely gazetted or proposed, and as such, their actual protected status is uncertain. Moreover, many of the Sumatran reserves are in montane regions where the species occurs only at low densities. In Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in southwestern Sumatra, as with other national parks in Sumatra that house agile gibbons, populations are presently secure and healthy, but their continued survival depends on the Indonesian government’s ability to stop the ongoing and illegal deforestation of its protected forest areas (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Ultimately, the key to conserving this species relies on the ability of local governments to uphold their national laws and regulations. Increasing monitoring capacity, improving law enforcement, stopping illegal logging, curbing legal logging and forest conversion, implementing forest restoration projects, stopping road construction, confronting human-animal conflict, and enhancing connectivity across fragmented landscapes are all key conservation actions that are urgently required.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Should the rate of forest loss continue to increase, this species' status could easily become critical, so close monitoring is essential.<br/></p>","<p>This species lives in primary and secondary semi-deciduous and tropical evergreen forest. All levels of the canopy are used, although emergent trees are required for resting and sleeping. Siamangs occur at lower densities in secondary forest, but can persist in secondary areas. They range from the lowlands up to 2,000 m in elevation in some areas of Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia (Yanuar 2009), with preferences for lowland and submontane/montane forest types. Siamangs are rarely found in swamp forest habitat. During a short survey in southern Sumatra, siamangs appeared to be less sensitive to habitat degradation than sympatric agile gibbons (<em>Hylobates agilis</em>) (Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2006). Siamangs were also noted to maintain relatively high densities at forest edges within the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia (O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2004). Nevertheless, compared to sympatric agile gibbons, this species was encountered infrequently at forest edges and within disturbed forest areas in the submontane forests of the Batang Toru Forest Complex, Sumatra, Indonesia (Nowak pers. obs.). <br/><br/>Though this species is primarily folivorous in mainland Asia (Chivers 1974; MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980; Raemaekers 1984), it is primarily frugivorous on Sumatra (West 1982; Palombit 1992, 1997; Nurcahyo 1998; Lappan 2009b). For both mainland Asia and Sumatra, their fruit/leaf diet is supplemented with moderate levels of flower and insect consumption. Palombit (1992, 1997) argues that these animals are flexible foragers, preferring fruit when available, but able to switch to leaves when necessary. Such flexibility may help reduce siamang vulnerability to habitat disturbance (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). Siamangs are strictly arboreal, highly territorial, and primarily monogamous (Chivers 1974). However, extra-pair copulations have been reported in Ketambe, Gunung Leuser National Park, Sumatra (Palombit 1994), and groups with more than one adult male have been reported in the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park population, Sumatra (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003; Lappan 2005, 2007, 2009d). Home range has been recorded at 15-47 ha on the Malayan peninsula (Chivers 1974; Raemaekers 1977; MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980) and 20-50 ha in previously studied Sumatran populations (Palombit 1997; Nurcahyo 1998; O’Brien <em>et al.</em> 2003; Lappan 2009b; Yanuar and Chivers 2010). Within the submontane forests of the Batang Toru Forest Complex, siamangs have been documented to have home ranges &gt;50 ha (Nowak pers. obs.). Dispersal distances are less than 3 km. O'Brien<em> et al</em>. (2003) found that monogamy and strict territoriality may limit the range of possible response to fire and other severe disturbances by this species. <br/><br/>Wild siamangs are known to have relatively slow life histories, including long interbirth intervals (&gt;3-4 years) (Palombit 1995; O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). The infant to subadult survival rate in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park for ‘normal’ groups was 61.7%, whereas for groups affected by ENSO-related wildfires, infant to subadult survival rate was substantially less (22%; O’Brien <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;</p>","<p>This species is threatened by forest conversion, mining, road construction, human encroachment and opportunistic poaching for pet trade and human consumption on Sumatra, with these threats often extending to populations in national parks and protected forests.

Furthermore, Lappan <em>et al</em>. (2017) have highlighted that between 2011 and 2016 that roughly 50% of their Way Canguk study population disappeared, possibly related to an epizootic disease outbreak. A similar case was described for a study group of wild siamangs at Ketambe (Palombit 1992).&#160; <br/><br/>Based on the recent data provided by Global Forest Watch, the rate of forest loss on Sumatra has accelerated over the last five years and, if that pace continues, it is possible to project a loss of nearly 60% of suitable forest habitat by mid-century.<br/><br/>The species' status in Malaysia is more uncertain, however, as with Sumatra, oil palm expansion has been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia (Miyamoto <em>et al.</em> 2014).

The population has declined to around 2,000 individuals occurring in small, isolated populations of 1-29 groups. A continuing decline over the next 45 years, at the same rate, is predicted, primarily due to hunting and habitat loss (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009, Li <em>et al</em>. 2011). While the species occurs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China, it is China that holds the most significant population, with only small populations occurring in the other two countries. The biggest threats to <em>Nomascus concolor</em>, throughout its range, include destructive local forest use and hunting, while selective logging and agriculture encroachment are additional threats (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012; Wei <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some areas (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014), these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades.</p>","This species occurs in subtropical and montane evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forest (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009c, Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006) and in China it is restricted to broadleaved evergreen forests (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a). In the Wuliang and Ailao Mountains, <em>Nomascus concolor concolor</em> occur at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,800 m (Bleisch and Chen 1991; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Li <em>et al</em>. 2011; Luo 2011) with no group occurring at elevations lower than 1,500 m (Fan pers. comm.). Food availability influenced ranging in <em>N. concolor</em>, wherein they avoided areas above 2,500 m, despite being less disturbed by human beings. In northern Viet Nam, the species was reported to occur at elevations of 1,600-2,000 m (Tien 1983). In Nam Kan NPA in Lao PDR, all records of remaining groups were made between 571 and 815 m asl (Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Feeding ecology for the species has been reported as 46.5% leaves, 25.5% fruit, 18.6% figs, 9.1% flowers, 0.3% other (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a,c). They have also been reported hunting and feeding on Giant Flying Squirrels (<em>Pateurista phillippensis</em>), bird eggs, chicks and lizards (Fan and Jiang 2009). Primary forest contains important perches as sleeping trees, for social activity such as singing, for locomotion, safety cover and as food resource while in China dwarf forests serve as corridors (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a,&#160;2009c). Average group sizes for <em>N. c. concolor</em> in Yunnan province also appear to vary strongly according to locality and/or study; most groups in the Wuliang Mountains have two breeding females (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2006; Fan and Jiang 2010). Based on five groups of <em>N. c. lu</em> observed in Nam Kan PPA in Lao PDR, an average group size of 3.6-3.8 individuals was determined (Geissmann 2007). Groups in China occupy large home ranges with observations of 151 ha, 260 ha and &gt;100 ha (Fan and Jiang 2008). Daily travel distances, as studied in a group in Dazhaizi, Wuliang Mountain, vary between 300-3,144 m, with an average of 1,391 m, correlating with fruit and leaf abundance, with low travel distances in months of stress i.e. low fruit availability (Fan and Jiang 2008).","<p>  </p><p>The biggest threats to <em>Nomascus concolor</em> throughout its range include destructive local forest use and hunting while selective logging and agriculture encroachment are additional threats (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012; Wei <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some area (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian 2014) these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades. Hunting and developmental activities such as infrastructure and Road No. 3, funded by the Asian Development Bank through Nam Kan, pose additional threats (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a; Peng-Fei <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Viet Nam, depending on the locality, these gibbons are threatened by mostly human impact on habitat and hunting pressure, but it is ultimately always a combination of the two. Other issues such as forest fire and hydropower construction threaten the Vietnamese portion of the population (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/></p><p>  </p>","While the species occurs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China, it is China that holds the most significant population of the taxon, with only small populations in the other two countries.

Ninety eight groups were reported in the Wuliang Mountains (Haimoff <em>et al</em>. 1986; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Lan 1993), but a later survey just confirmed 87 groups (Luo 2011).

Most groups found in the Wuliang Mountains live in stable bi-female groups with an average group size of 6.2 individuals (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2006), therefore, the total population in the Wuliang Mountains is estimated to be 500-600 individuals (if an average group size of six individuals is used). In the Ailao Mountains, approximately 180 groups persist in six counties with 124 groups in Xinping, 11 groups in Chuxiong, 2 groups in Nanhua, 26 groups in Shuangbai, 9 groups in Jingdong, and 9 groups in Zhenyuan (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012); with around 680-720 individuals (if an average group size of four individuals per group is used).

On the west bank of Mekong River, there are two sites with confirmed records; three groups in Yongde Daxueshan Nature Reserve (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012) and two groups in Xuezhulingdashan. This population, formerly recognized as <em>Nomascus concolor furvogaster</em>, is on the edge of extinction.<br/><br/>The population of <em>N. c. concolor</em> in Viet Nam consists of only 22–25 groups, with <em>ca.</em> 20 groups in the contiguous Mu Cang Chai Species Habitat Conservation Area, Yen Bai Province and Muong La forests, Son La Province and only 2–5 groups in Van Ban Nature Reserve (Haimoff <em>et al</em>. 1986; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Tien 1983). In Van Nan, the population is likely decreasing and in Muong La/Mu Cang Chai it has stabilized in recent years (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The population of <em>N. c. lu</em> in Lao PDR is, likewise, heavily suppressed and is known to occur in only two areas: Nam Kan NPA and Nam Ha NPA (MAF 2011). In Nam Kan NPA, in the most recent and comprehensive surveys, only three localities were found to still hold gibbons, with 10 gibbon groups heard and 39 individuals observed. This suggests that the largest Lao PDR population is small and vulnerable; the study documented some locations previously known to have gibbons no longer did. The core population is centred around an ecotourism project which, together with local taboos against hunting, provides protection for this small population (Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Decreasing,"The species as a whole occurs discontinuously in southwestern China, northwestern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). One thousand years ago, gibbons that may have been crested gibbons (genus <em>Nomascus</em>) were distributed over a large part of southern and central China up to the Yellow River (Geissmann 1995, Luo 2011, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><strong><em>Nomascus concolor concolor</em></strong><br/>This subspecies occurs in southern China (central and southwestern Yunnan) and northern Viet Nam (Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Son La, and Lai Chau provinces) (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000).

An isolated population, it is known for certain only in a tiny area in on the east bank of the Mekong at about 20°17'-20°25'N (Groves 2001). It is confirmed in Nam Ha NPA, Luang Namtha province, and in the Nam Kan NPA, Bokeo province (Timmins and Duckworth 2013).","<p>In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some area (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian 2014) these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades.</p>",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I.

While the population has undergone some sporadic declines since that time, other unprotected areas (notably Van Ban NR) have undergone precipitous declines when protections have been removed (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). These sites are protected by local conservation teams and a co-management mechanism has been put into place to allow local communities to work with protected area authorities, in order to mitigate impacts to wildlife and forests (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Nam Kan NPA is identified as the only remaining population warranting conservation intervention. This population is partially protected by an ecotourism project, the Gibbon Experience, which funds forest patrols and provides revenue to local communities, reducing risks to the resident population (MAF 2011).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Declining populations are due to the significant and ongoing threats of hunting, live capture and forest loss. The two countries in which this species occurs, Viet Nam and Lao PDR, have already lost significant tropical forest cover this century, and will likely lose substantially more should current deforestation rates continue over the next few decades. Since 2004, according to Global Forest Watch statistics, Viet Nam lost approximately  15% of its forest cover in the last 15 years (one generation)  and could conceivably  lose an additional 45% or more in the next 30 years (two generations). The situation in Lao PDR is similar: a 15% loss of forest cover from  2004-2018 and a potential 50% overall loss of forest cover (or greater)  as we approach the year 2050.&#160;&#160;&#160;  <br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p><em>Nomascus siki</em> lives in tall primary broadleaf evergreen forest and, at least historically, was found between elevations of 30 to 1,900 m in a typical wet tropical climate, with no influence of the northeast monsoon and no conspicuous dry season (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Timmins and Duckworth 2013; Ujhelyi <em>et al.</em> 2000; N.M. Ha pers. comm.). Conversion of lowland forest means they are no longer found at lower elevations in Viet Nam where their primary habitat is evergreen forest from 300-1,000 m (N.M. Ha pers. comm.). In Lao PDR, gibbons are found from the Mekong plains up to 1,900 m in Nakai Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Timmins and Duckworth 2013). The species is found in both limestone and non-limestone forests (N.M. Ha pers. comm.), and may have higher densities in the later based on observations around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park (Dat <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Gibbons are strictly arboreal, diurnal and mainly frugivorous (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000)<em></em>, but there are very few field data on the behavioral ecology of <em>N. siki</em>. Ruppell (2013) recorded an activity budget including resting (30%), feeding (33%), travelling (35%), and singing (2%) and an average home range of 37.9 hectares, with a day range of 1.48 km per day. Average group size is unknown except for a few records suggesting they live in monogamous groups of one male, one female with offspring. They start the day with loud vocalizations.</p>","<p>Hunting, in particular, is a major threat in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR where they are used both in traditional “medicine,” for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting of gibbons with guns is often opportunistic rather than specifically targeted at gibbons (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Unlike in Lao PDR, the forest habitat of <em>Nomascus siki</em> in Viet Nam is heavily fragmented due to the human pressures of deforestation and agricultural encroachment which, when coupled with hunting, are resulting in populations becoming small, isolated and potentially unviable in many locations (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting continues to be a significant threat to gibbons in Lao PDR, with increased access through infrastructure development opening up areas with previously relatively secure gibbon populations (Duckworth 2008). Currently, large areas of available habitat and availability of higher value species for exploitation mean that <em>N. siki</em> is relatively secure in Lao PDR, however it is expected that declines will continue at high rates due to lack of genuine protection activities in most areas (Duckworth 2008).<br/><br/>Habitat loss has negatively impacted past gibbon generations and could become a more significant threat in future years. According to Global Forest Watch statistics, Viet Nam lost approximately 15% of its forest cover in the last 15 years (one generation) and, should current rates of deforestation continue, could conceivably lose an additional 45% or more in the next 30 years (two generations). The situation in Lao PDR is similar, a 15% loss of forest cover from 2004-2018 and a potential 50% overall loss of forest cover (or greater) as we approach the year 2050.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>  </p><p>In Viet Nam, the species has been surveyed at some level for all major areas of occurrence since 2000, with no recorded extirpations since that time, although populations appear to be small and in continuing decline because of hunting and habitat loss (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Rawson <em>et al</em>. (2011) identified key sites for conservation including two large forest complexes, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park-Truong Son State Forest Enterprise and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise-Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve complexes. Surveys across the species' range in Viet Nam suggest that these areas support most of the known <em>N. siki </em>population in the country. Importantly, these areas are contiguous with forest in Laos where <em>N. siki </em>populations may be more robust. Sites that have recorded <em>N. siki</em> since 2000, along with minimum confirmed numbers of groups, were summarized by Rawson <em>et al.</em> (2011) and include: Khe Ve Proposed Nature Reserve - ≥ 7 groups; Giang Man Proposed Nature Reserve - ≥ 5 groups; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park - ≥ 50 groups; Truong Son State Forest Enterprise - ≥ 10 groups; Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise ≥ 4 groups; Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve - ≥ 23 groups. While these surveys do not represent full counts of the gibbon populations at these sites, it is clear that many populations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, population estimates are generally lacking, but the species is more common than in Viet Nam, and represents the majority of the global population (Duckworth<em> et al.</em> 1999; Duckworth 2008). In Nakai-Nam Theun NPA, population density has been estimated at 1 to 3 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in a 120 km<sup>2</sup> area in the central part of the NPA (Coudrat and Nanthavong 2014). In Hin Nam No NPA, Phiapalath (2009) documented a relative abundance of 0.03 groups/km of reconnaissance trails walked with an average group size of 3.8 individuals, while, in Phou Hin Poun NPA, Phiapalath <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated an abundance of 0.37 groups/km and an average group size of 3.6. The species is known from Nam Kading, Nakai Nam Theun, Hin Nam No and Phou Hinpoun National Protected Areas, although given the uncertainty of its distribution range to the south this may be an incomplete list.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in central Lao PDR, east of the Mekong River, and central Viet Nam (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The limits of distribution of this species have been significantly reduced after the the description of <em>Nomascus annamensis</em> to the south (Thinh<em> et al</em>. 2010), which is now recognized to include much of the formerly recognized range of <em>N. siki</em>. The species distribution limits are not finally settled, both with regards to <em>N. annamensis</em> in the south and <em>N. leucogenys</em> in the north. The northern limit of the species might be the Kading River in Laos and the Rao Nay River in Vietnam (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). The southern limit of the species in Lao PDR is unknown, but the Banghiang River could be a possible natural barrier. In Viet Nam, the species occurs in parts of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces (Rawson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011) with the southern limit as the Thach Han River (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). It has been suggested that there may be some range overlap between <em>N. siki</em> and <em>N. annamensis</em> in Quang Tri province (N.M. Ha pers. comm.). Importantly, these areas are contiguous with forest in Lao PDR where <em>N. siki </em>populations may be more robust.</p>","Hunting, in particular, is a major threat to this species, in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR, where it is used both in traditional “medicine,” for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Terrestrial,"<p>  </p><p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I and is legally protected in Viet Nam (Appendix 1b of Decree 32, 2006) and in Lao PDR (Category 1 protected species in accordance with the Wildlife Law (2007) and Decree 81/PM of 2008). In Viet Nam, the species is assessed as EN in the Viet Nam Red Data Book (2007) but has been proposed for uplisting to CR under criteria A1cd (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Viet Nam, it has been recorded in six sites including two protected areas; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve and two proposed nature reserves, Khe Ve and Giang Man, with the rest of its national distribution outside of the protected area network (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protected areas in Lao PDR where the species occurs include Nam Kading, Nakai Nam Theun, Hin Nam No and Phou Hin Poun NPAs, though given the uncertainty of the southerly extent of the species distribution range it may occur in additional areas.<br/><br/>There is currently no dedicated protection or monitoring of <em>N. siki </em>in any site in Viet Nam, where uncontrolled hunting and habitat loss remain the greatest threats to <em>N. siki</em> (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The species is in decline throughout its range in Viet Nam and there are no clear instances of conservation success to control declines, either directly or as part of other biodiversity initiatives. Key sites for conservation in Viet Nam are two large forest complexes, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park-Truong Son State Forest Enterprise and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise-Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve complexes. The most critical conservation interventions in Viet Nam are to curtail hunting of gibbons in the key sites of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve through dedicated and accountable ranger patrols (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Outside of the protected area network, within state forest enterprises which support <em>N. siki</em>, sustainable logging practices and the inclusion of biodiversity conservation in site logging plans is required (Rawson<em> et al</em>. 2011). Additional survey efforts in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve, Giang Man Proposed Nature Reserve and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise may reveal these populations as higher global priorities than currently recognized (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, support for protected area management and protection of <em>N. siki</em> is ongoing in a number of protected areas including; Nam Kading NPA, supported by Wildlife Conservation Society; Nakai – Nam Theun NPA supported by Project Anoulak in collaboration with the Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA); Phou Hin Poun NPA supported by IUCN; and Hin Nam No NPA supported by GIZ-Lao Program. These sites represent the highest priority populations for conservation (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting is the main threat to <em>N. siki</em> in Lao PDR and therefore strict enforcement of gun control laws in key areas must remain a priority action for conservation groups. Additional efforts to control forest encroachment are also required to stop declines of <em>N. siki </em>populations. Eco-tourism opportunities in Lao PDR and building capacity of Lao conservationists represent investments which may have increasing impact in coming years (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Additional, research and field surveys throughout their global range, specifically tape recordings, genetic analysis and photographic recordings will likely help better define the distribution area of the taxon relative to <em>N. annamensis</em> and <em>N. leucogenys </em>(this is an on-going project implemented and coordinated by Project Anoulak <a href=""http://conservationlaos.com/"">http://conservationlaos.com</a><em>)</em><em>.</em> Knowledge of the species' ecology is also lacking, suggesting additional ecological research is required.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

These threats have impacted the previous generation (2001-2015), continue to impact the present generation (2016-2030) and will very likely impact the subsequent generation (2031-2045), during which time (45 years) the two range countries could conceivably lose 50% or more of their forest cover.<br/><p></p>","<p>This species is found in tall evergreen and semi-evergreen forest (Geissman <em>et al</em>. 2000), and occasionally in other forest types such as mixed bamboo and woodland forest (Kenyon 2007, Ha <em>et al</em>. 2014). Though dry deciduous dipterocarp forests are present in their range, these gibbons do not appear to utilize these forests where associated semi-evergreen or evergreen forest is absent (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Channa and Gray 2009). Individuals&#160;feed mainly on fruit and leaves (Traeholt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005), although a study in Cat Tien National Park (NP) showed that their diet is made up of 38.6% of figs, 43% of other fruits, 9.5% of mature leaves and 8.9% of flowers (Kenyon 2007). Home range sizes range between 14.2 and 60.5 ha, with an average of 41 ha, but may vary depending on habitat, for example, from less than 30 ha in evergreen forest to up to 100 ha in bamboo forest in Cat Tien NP (Kenyon 2007).<br/><br/>The species was reported to be scarce above altitudes of 1,500 m (Eames and Robson 1993). However, recent studies indicated that <em>N. gabriellae</em> occurs at a wide range of elevations, from about 100 m (Cat Tien NP) up to higher than 2,287 m (Chu Yang Sin NP). Surveys above 1,500 m altitude in Bidoup-<span lang=""DE"">Nui Ba NP recorded a density of 0.29 groups/km<sup>2</sup> (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Like other gibbons, red-cheeked gibbons are arboreal and diurnal, with singing bouts averaging 12 minutes and lower calling frequencies in the wet season (Rawson 2004, Kenyon 2007). The species displays a monogamous social structure of adult pair and offspring. Average group size is estimated at 3-5 individuals. Females emigrate near, in and around their natal territories, but males emigrate farther and wider. Female give birth to single offspring at 17-22 month intervals.</p><p><span lang=""DE""></span></p>","The major threats in Viet Nam are hunting for the pet trade, habitat loss and degradation, and small and fragmented population (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The main causes of these threats are capturing of young ones by killing the mother, capture for zoos and private collection, planned or unplanned forest conversion, developmental activities such as infrastructure development, encroachment and illegal logging. Females and infants are held as pets in hotels and private areas such as zoos. Interview surveys with traders revealed at least 24-26 gibbons of the species were traded in southern provinces sourced from Lam Dong and Dong Nai province around the time of the survey, and can be sourced on demand (WCS 2009). Of 41 cases of possession of gibbons reported to ENV between 2005 and 2009, 32 were from southern provinces (ENV 2010). In Cambodia, hunting, logging and habitat loss, often due to economic land concession designation, are major threats for the species (Channa and Gray 2009, Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The threat of habitat loss is significant, historic and ongoing.&#160; According to current Global Forest Watch data, 1) Vietnam has lost 16% of its forest cover since the turn of the century and, should current rates of forest cover loss continue, could very well lose close to 60% of its forests by the year 2045; and 2) Cambodia&#160; has lost a full 25% of its forest cover since the turn of the century and, should current rates of forest loss continue, could lose as much as 70% of its forests by the year 2045.","<p>It is likely that this species is the most common of the crested gibbons in Cambodia (Chana and Gray 2009, Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005) and Viet Nam (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000, Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Viet Nam, no population data were available for <em>N. gabriellae</em> in the 2000 gibbon status review (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). However,&#160; it was fairly common in some areas of Dak Lak province, and the Lam Dong Plateau seems to support a relatively large population of this species (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). After 2000, gibbon surveys have been undertaken in many sites within the species<span lang=""DE"">’ range and important populations were found both inside and outside protected areas. <br/><br/>Within protected areas, the population has been estimated as being at least 150 groups and around 500 individuals in Cat Tien NP (Kenyon 2007; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011), 17 groups in Bi Doup-Nui Ba Mountain, part of Bidoup <span lang=""DE"">– Nui Ba NP (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010), 124 groups in Bu Gia Map National Park (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2014), 78 groups in Phuoc Binh NP (Duc <em>et al.</em> 2015), 54 groups in Hon Ba NR (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2015), and 166 groups in Chu Yang Sin NP (Thinh <em>et al.</em> in press). Smaller populations were also found in Nam Nung and Ta Dung NR (Ha <em>et al</em>. 2014, Duc <em>et al</em>. 2010), and Dong Nai NR. Outside protected areas, the populations were estimated at 86 groups in Quang Truc Commune, Dak Nong province (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2014), 56 groups in Ninh Son State Forest Enterprise, Ninh Thuan Province and about 66 groups in forest areas of Thanh Son and Son Trung Commune, and 52 groups in Son Thai - Giang Ly Communes, Khanh Hoa Province (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2015).

The last population in China apparently disappeared several years prior to this species' last assessment. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, hunting and live capture continue and will likely do so over the long-term. Over a 45 year period that includes the previous generation (2005-2019) and the next two generations (2020-2049), it is suspected that suitable habitat within the species' overall range will be reduced by 60% or more which, combined with population declines due to uncontrolled exploitation, will result in an overall population decline of 80% or more.</p>","<p>This diurnal, arboreal and territorial species is found in tall primary and degraded evergreen and semi-evergreen forest. In northwestern Viet Nam and northern Lao PDR, the animals live in a subtropical climate with a short and not very cold winter without frost (Tien 1983). In Viet Nam, the species is found from 200 m to well over 1,000 m asl, with the highest record coming from Pu Mat NP from a listening post positioned at 1,500m asl (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011), however, individuals are now found mostly above 700 m due to lowland deforestation (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Lao PDR, gibbons are found from the Mekong plains up to at least 1,650 m in Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Duckworth 2008).<br/><br/>Gibbons are strictly arboreal and mainly frugivorous (Ruppell 2013), but there is very little field data on the behavioral ecology of <em>N. leucogenys</em>. Dao Van Tien (1983) studied the stomach contents of six wild-shot crested gibbons (genus <em>Nomascus</em>) from Viet Nam, including three <em>N. leucogenys</em>, and found 90-100% fruits, associated with some leaves and insects. This data cannot be directly compared to field observations, which usually measure the time spent eating various food items (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Food composition of individuals from Xishuangbanna (southern Yunnan) included fruits (39%), leaves (36%), and flowers (5%) (Hu <em>et al. </em>1989). A 12-month behavioral ecology study of the species in Nam Kading NPA shows that the species here consumed more leaves (53-85% of monthly diet) than fruits, but the percentage of fruit in the diet increased from January to May when fruits were more abundant (Ruppell 2013). On average, the three groups studied annually spent 30% of their time resting, 33% feeding, 35% travelling and 2% singing (with a seasonal variation; Ruppell 2013). During the rainy season (May-October), when many fruits are available, gibbons travel less, whereas in the dry season (November-April), gibbons eat more leaves and travel for longer distances (Hu <em>et al</em>. 1989). <br/><br/>Average group size in Yunnan province, China, was 3.78 (range 3-5, n = 9) (Hu <em>et al</em>. 1989). In anecdotal reports, group sizes of three gibbon groups from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces (southern part of north Viet Nam) were specified as 3, 3, and 4 individuals, respectively (Ha <em>et al</em>. 2005). Mean home range size of the three groups in Nam Kading NPA was 38 ha (29 - 44 ha), and the mean daily path length was 1.5 km (Ruppell 2013).</p>","<p><em>Nomascus leucogenys</em> has suffered from deforestation through agricultural encroachment into lowland and mountainous areas, in addition to fuel-wood and timber extraction from remaining forest habitats. Hunting for food and traditional medicines, as well as the live capture of young animals for the illegal pet trade, are major threats across the species' range and are regarded as a significant cause for its decline in all three countries, including its extirpation&#160; in China (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al</em>. 2018; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Viet Nam, where survey efforts have been considerable, many populations have been found to be small and local extirpations are reported as common (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Small remaining populations are vulnerable to ongoing hunting pressure and habitat degradation as well as impacts of small population sizes (e.g., disease, environmental events, inbreeding depression). Even low off-take from hunting in small populations of <em>N. leucogenys</em> can result in population collapse (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009).</p><p>Viet Nam has lost close to 15% of its forest cover since this species was last assessed in 2008 and could lose 60% or more of its forest cover the course of the next 30 years (two generations) if current annual rates do not decline. Lao PDR, the stronghold for this species, has lost more than 10% of its forest cover since this species was last assessed in 2008 and could also lose as mush as 60% or more of its forest over the course of the next 30 years (two generations).<br/></p>","<p>In China the species may now be extinct (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014). A series of surveys has documented its decline from possibly 1,000 individuals in the 1960s to probable extirpation (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Fooden 1996; Fan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014;&#160;Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). The most recent surveys in Mengla and Shangyong Nature Reserve, Yunnan, China, in 2008 and 2011 determined that the species is either extinct or functionally extinct in China (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Lao PDR holds the largest remaining populations of <em>N. leucogenys</em> due to relatively large areas of habitat, although gibbon hunting for the pet trade, bones for medicinal purposes and local consumption continues to seriously impact these populations (Duckworth 2008). Forest fragmentation is much higher in the range of <em>N. leucogenys</em> than in the ranges of other gibbon species, and the population densities are lower due to higher exploitation (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Evans <em>et al.</em> 2000). In some parts of Lao PDR, the species has been protected through hunting taboos, but these local traditions have been disappearing, leading to an increase in their hunting (Duckworth 2008). Population estimates for the Lao PDR protected area network are largely lacking, and it is unlikely that there are any 'safe' populations given hunting pressure. Population estimates in Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA include 41 and 11 groups detected across a total of 368 km<sup>2</sup> with a density of 0.13 and 0.20 groups/km<sup>2 </sup>in the two areas (Coudrat and Nanthavong 2014; Ruppell 2013). At least 10 groups were detected during a short survey in the southern part of Phou Den Din NPA. Key protected areas for the species in Lao PDR include; Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA, Nam Kading NPA north of the Nam Kading River, with second tier priorities being Phou Den Din NPA, Nam Xan NPA and Phou Khao Khouay NPA.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the species has been severely impacted by hunting and habitat loss, and now appears to persist only in pockets, largely within the protected area network. These populations, isolated by habitat fragmentation, are further internally fragmented by hunting pressure, leaving large gaps between small numbers of groups. Rawson <em>et al.</em> (2011) estimated that there may be only 300 groups remaining in Viet Nam, most of which occur close to the Lao border. It appears that the species has been recently extirpated from Hang Kia-Pa Co, Ngoc Son-Ngo Luong and Pu Luong Nature Reserves, and Khe Net Proposed Nature Reserve (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protected areas where the species has been confirmed since 2000 include: Muong Nhe NR, Sop Cop NR, Pu Hu NR, Xuan Lien NR, Pu Hoat NR, Pu Huong NR, Pu Mat NP, Vu Quang NP, Ke Go NR (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011), although populations in many of these are very low and potentially not viable in the long-term. The two priority populations for conservation in Viet Nam are Pu Mat NP with an estimated 455 gibbons in 130 groups (22 confirmed) (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Xuan Lien NR and adjacent Pu Hoat NR, with an estimate of at least 41 groups (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in northwestern Viet Nam, northern Lao PDR and southwestern China. In Viet Nam, it occurs west and south of the Black River; it has been extirpated from several areas from which it was previously recorded and is now only known from a few localities in the north-west and north-central parts of the country (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The southern boundary of the species in Viet Nam is not well defined, however, based on genetic and vocal evidence it appears to be to at least to the Rao Nay River, near Vu Quang National Park (Thinh <em>et al.</em> 2010a, 2010b)<em>.<br/></em><br/>In Lao PDR, it occurs in the northern parts, east of the Mekong River, except for a small area in northwestern Lao PDR on the east bank of the Mekong at about 20°17'-20°25'N, where it is replaced by <em>Nomascus</em><em>&#160;concolor </em>(Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2000). Its southern-most range limit in Lao PDR is not well defined, but it is believed to lie somewhere within Bolikhamxay-Khammouan Provinces. The Kading River is suggested as the biogeographical barrier between <em>N. leucogenys</em> and the more southerly <em>N. siki</em>, though the river towards the east is unlikely to represent a barrier given its reduced size (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b).<br/><br/>In China, the species was historically widely distributed between the Mekong and Red Rivers in Mengla, Jiangcheng and Luchun counties, in south Yunnan (Ma and Wang 1986, Fan <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, a series of surveys has documented its decline from possibly 1,000 individuals in the 1960s to probable extirpation in China (Ma and Wang 1986, Fooden 1996, Nettlebeck&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Fan and Huo 2009). The most recent surveys suggested that the species is either extinct or functionally extinct in China (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>","Hunting for food, traditional ""medicines"" and pets is a major threat across the species range, and is likely to have been the primary cause for the decline of the species in all three countries, including the presumed extinction of this species in China (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al.</em> 2018; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I. It is legally protected in Viet Nam (Appendix 1B of Decree 32, 2006) and in Lao PDR (<span lang=""FR"">‘Prohibition<span lang=""FR"">’ category in the list of protected species) and in China as a Class I Protected Animal under the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Law. However, despite these legal protections there has been little effective enforcement in any country to protect this species against forest encroachment and poaching.<br/><span lang=""FR""><br/>The population in China is likely functionally extinct and, as such, direct conservation action is not necessary. However, maintenance of habitat quality within protected areas in its former range should be pursued to allow for the possibility of population reintroductions in the future.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the species is now largely restricted to the protected area network, including Muong Nhe NR, Sop Cop NR, Pu Hu NR, Xuan Lien NR, Pu Hoat NR, Pu Huong NR, Pu Mat NP, Vu Quang NP and Ke Go NR. Priority sites for conservation interventions are Pu Mat NP and Xuan Lien NR and surrounds (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Currently, no significant conservation interventions above and beyond those provided by protected areas operations are underway. Given the potential importance of these sites not just nationally, but globally, additional financial and technical investment is required, primarily to ensure effective protection as a first measure.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the species is present in Nam Et-Phou Loey, Nam Xam, Phou Khao Khoay, Phou Panang, Nam Kading, and Phou Den Din National Protected Areas, and also in Santong Training and Model Forest and in the Nam Ngiep Subcatchment. There is an action plan for gibbon conservation in Lao PDR which includes <em>N. leucogenys</em> (MAF 2011). The action plan identifies Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA and Nam Kading NPA as first tier priorities with Phou Den Din, Nam Xan NPA and Phou Khao Khouay NPA as second tier priorities. Currently, WCS is implementing projects in both Nam Et-Phou Loei and Nam Kading NPAs with strong enforcement components.<br/><br/>Across the species' range, hunting control is a vital conservation measure: populations are already small and fragmented and, therefore, extremely vulnerable to additional off-take. Additional measures include ensuring habitat protection and improved zoning and planning to take into account key areas for gibbons within existing protected areas. Environmental education for local communities and government authorities is required. Significant technical and financial investment will be required to ensure priority areas are controlled and maintained. While this is currently occurring in Lao PDR, in Viet Nam considerable additional (international) inputs are likely to be required.<br/></span><br/>The species is commonly represented in zoo collections, both regionally and internationally, and as such there is future opportunity for reintroduction and/or population reinforcement, assuming required protocols can be met (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Hunted animals are used for traditional medicines, and for national and international trade in pets and tourist photo props. Bengal Slow Lorises are also caught for meat, and their body parts are used as tourist key rings. The combined effects of forest loss of more than 30% over the last 24 years, and disappearance of the species in several locations in countries like Cambodia due to hunting, and continued threats into the future are factors determining the declines in the past, continuing and suspected declines in the future.</p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This is an arboreal, nocturnal species that inhabits tropical evergreen rainforest, semi-evergreen forest, and mixed deciduous forest. In Viet Nam it is found only in secondary forests, and on the edge of primary forests; the species also occurs in agricultural fields and plantations (V. Thanh pers. comm., Pliosongnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). It ranges from sea level (U. Streicher pers. comm.) up to 2,400 m (Choudhury 2001). In Cambodia, <em>N. bengalensis </em>has been observed in dipterocarp and evergreen forest (Mould 2013, Eam Sam Un 2014) and community forests (Eam Sam Un 2014). In India, they are found in semi-evergreen, evergreen and mixed deciduous forest (Das 2005, 2009, 2014; Pliosungnoen 2014). In Laos, the species is found often in protected evergreen forests (Evans 2000, Coudrat 2012), and have also been observed in plantation forests (Pliosungnoen unpublished data) and bamboo stands (Streicher pers. comm). It can live in heavily disturbed agricultural areas if suitable foods are available.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>The diet of the Bengal Slow Loris consists of nectar, plant bark, fruits and small invertebrates; the majority of their wild diet comprises plant exudates and this is a key staple year round (Swapna <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Das <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Nycticebus bengalensis</em> are venomous, as are other members of the slow loris genus (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>This animal's life span is about 15 years, and generation time is 7-8 years.

Streicher pers. comm).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">The major threats that this species' habitat faces include farming, timber removal, human settlement, road building, dams, power lines, fragmentations, soil loss and erosion, and deliberately set fires. It is hunted and traded for food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pet (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V. Thanh and U. Streicher pers. comm., Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). Road kills represent another threat to this species (Rhadakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is also threatened for the tourist photo prop trade across some of its range, particularly in Thailand, where 94% of individuals photographed in the photo prop trade from Patong beach were <em>N. bengalensis </em>(Osterberg and Nekaris 2015); this trade is extending into Europe, in countries such as Turkey. The species has been observed for sale in markets for traditional medicine purposes at Mong La, on the Chinese border of Myanmar (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2013), where its arms are also sold as key rings (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is also known to be sold for use in traditional medicine elsewhere (Cambodia, Viet Nam and India) (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The exploitation of the species appears to be particularly high in Cambodia with researchers reporting no <em>N. bengalensis </em>present at most sites (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The release of slow lorises confiscated from the illegal pet trade with little or no rehabilitation is a threat to all slow loris species, as is translocation from human-dominated landscapes into forests, to which individuals of the species may not be adapted (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Starr and Nekaris 2015). Lack of law enforcement further threatens slow loris species across their range (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>In India, the encounter rates vary from 0.1 to 0.77/km (Radhakrishna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Surveys have been carried out in Assam, India since 2005, with densities fluctuating over time. In 2005, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>ranged from 0.03-0.05 individuals/km (Das, 2005), in 2009 densities were found at 0.18 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2009). In 2014, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>had declined to a range of 0.06-0.20 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2015).

In 2011, a juvenile Bengal slow loris was encountered downhill from Saw Law (N 26.15396, E 98. 27053; elevation 1,541 m asl) on the way back to Chibwe (N 25.88614, E 98.12851; elevation 257 m asl). Hunters in this area also reported seeing them during shifting cultivation. A captive Bengal slow loris was recorded in Phimaw Internally Displaced Person’s camp in February - March 2013 that was reported to come from the local area. According to local people, slow lorises are rarely seen in this area and are not easy to find. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, no specific nation-wide population survey on this species has been carried out, but a 2015 survey team encountered 34 Bengal slow lorises (18-night survey) in Satchari National Park of Sylhet division. A one-night survey in Lawachara National Park revealed three individuals (S.C. Rahman, pers. comm). The species was also recorded in Rema-Kalenga&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>, 2011) and Rajkandi Reserve Forest of Sylhet area (M. Foysal, T. Khan, pers.comm). Feeroz (2013) reported <em>N. bengalensis </em>as being rare in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittagong region. All of these forests are semi- evergreen. A photography record is available from Kaptai National Park, Rangamati Hill District under Chittagong division (S.R. Rahul, pers. comm.). Beside these records, since 2010, several Bengal Slow Lorises were taken from human habitation in Jamalpur, Sherpur and Mymensingh district. These districts have some deciduous forests and are connected with Meghalaya state of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan Choudhury (2008) reports that Bengal slow loris habitat is mostly tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the foothills up to 300 m. The species has been indirectly recorded in the possession of woodcutters in four dzongkhags including Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarpang and Zemgang. From this, Choudhury inferred that they should occur in Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Wangchuk&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) wrote that lorises also occur in Chukha and Samchi districts, but did not say on what evidence. The existing records indicate that the Sankosh River is the western limit for the species in Bhutan as well as Assam.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, some researchers report the population to occur potentially in large forest tracts (R. Timmins pers. comm). Duckworth (1994) and Ratajszczak (1998), however, both reported the species as being very rare in Lao PDR, with the former reporting abundance indices of about 0.30-0.65/km at sites including: Central Laos (Phou Xang He, NakaiNam Theun, Xe Piang, Muang Hom, Nam Kading, Nam Ao, Bang Navang) and South Laos (Xe Namoy). In 2000, published data from 1994-1995 recorded <em>N. bengalensis </em>frequency as “common” in some forests (Phou Khaokhoay NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, and Bolavens Northeast PPA), whereas they were encountered “occasional” in others (Nakai Plateau) (Evans, et al., 2000, Streicher, 2014). A single record comes from Southern Laos in Xe Kaman lowlands in Dong Ampham NBCA, Attapu Province&#160; (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the populations are severely reduced and have disappeared from many forests (Fitch-Snyder and Thanh 2002; V. Thanh pers. comm). Surveys carried out in northern Viet Nam at Na Hang Nature Reserve in 2013 recorded a density of 0.09 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data). Recent surveys of N. bengalensis in Central Vietnam at Bach Ma National Park returned no animals in 30.4 km of surveys (Blair, unpublished data). A large population with a phenotype of the Cambodian forms occurs on Phu Quoc island in the Gulf of Thailand (Huaong and Blair, pers. comm). Surveys in 2014 in Phu Quoc Island recorded a density of 0.38 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the species is very rare and has only been seen west of the Mekong River in Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Kulen National Park at 22.5-25.0 animals per km2 (Starr et al., 2010). Observations of recently hunted animals were made in Preah Vihear Protection Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Tbeng (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2011). Starr <em>et al</em>. (2010) failed to detect this species in Bokor National Park and Cardamoms Protected Forest; they also did not detect it east of the Mekong (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri PF); Coudrat et al. also could not find this species east of the Mekong at the following sites: Mondulkiri (Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Pritch Wildlife Sanctuary) or Ratanakiri (Vonsei District, Virachey National Park, Seima Protection Forest, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary). Other surveyors in Cambodia have noted the presence of the species in a number of community forests (Eam Sam Un, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Bengal slow loris is thought to be widespread (W. Brockelman pers. comm.) but has never been surveyed specifically.&#160; It is known from Khao Yai National Park. Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the species is absent from many forests, and occurs at very low densities when present. In plantation forest in Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, they recorded Bengal slow lories at a density of 0.64 individuals/km (Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In China, surveys have been carried out since 2013. Bengal Slow Loris habitat is mostly primary evergreen broad-leaf forest up to 2,200 m. The population occurs in counties of western and southwestern Yunnan (Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhenkang, Cangyuan, Gengma, Yongde, Shuangjiang, Ximeng, Lancang, Menglian, Menghai, Mengla), even in secondary forests and agricultural plantations (Ni, pers. comm.). Survey in Cangyuan recorded a density of 0.33 individuals/km (Ni, unpublished data). In southern and southeastern Yunnan, Bengal slow loris is mostly distributed in scattered nature reserves as follows: Yuanjiang, Amushan, Guanyinshan, Huanglianshan, Fenshuiling, Daweishan, Laojunshan, Gulinqing, Laoshan. The populations are severely reduced and have possibly disappeared from southwest of Guangxi Province (Ni, per. comm.). Suitable habitat, also containing gibbons, can be found in many nature reserves, where the species is likely present but still to be confirmed, including Nanguanhe, Ailaoshan, Xishuangbanna, Nabanhe, Wenshan in Yuannan; and Bangliang in Guangxi.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Bangladesh, Cambodia West of the Mekong River, China (southern and western Yunnan and possibly in southwestern Guangxi), north-eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra, and Viet Nam.</p>","The species is&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">hunted and traded for (i) food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pets (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V.

In Sabah, Stark (unpublished data) found that the Philippine slow loris regularly slept in dense trees characterised by lianas and climbers, choosing many sleeping trees, reusing them only a few times.     </span></p>","<span class=""None"">Burning of habitat and conversion, especially to palm oil plantations, almost certainly represents a threat to this species. Although it is relatively adaptable to anthropogenic habitats, and so it might less affected by forest loss than some other primate species, forest loss has been so severe in the region that it is likely to have had some negative impacts. The species is collected locally for use as pets; subsequent uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also a threat. Captured wild animals are also used as tourist attraction in some hotels or tourist camps in Borneo (Miard unpublished). Forest fires of 2015 on Borneo have been the worst since 2004, and acres of forest has been burned, leading to a significant decrease in the habitat of this species. Lack of law enforcement further threatens slow loris species across their range (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2010, Nijman <em>et al.</em>, 2014).","<span class=""None"">Based on data collected from researchers in the field and old specimens from museum collections, Meijaard&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2005) suggested that this species is common throughout Borneo. However, loris ""presence"" is usually not determined first-hand (Chivers and Burton 1988, Indrawan and Rangkuti 2001), and it also cannot be presumed that lorises still occur in areas from where they were once collected. The species actually seems to be very uncommon throughout its range. It has a very limited distribution in the Philippines (Dagosto and Gebo 1995, Heaney&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998). In Kalimantan, a 3-month survey in a protected peat swamp forest (Sabangau National Park) revealed very low densities of slow lorises, 0.21 - 0.38 animals/km (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). When comparing this to other studies of <em>Nycticebus</em>, it seems clear that this species, when it does occur, is rare. Indeed, in 46,000 trapping nights in Kinabalu National Park, Wells&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) trapped this species only three times, and noted that in nocturnal walks over five years, it was rarely seen. The species was found to occur at an encounter rate of 0.12 individuals/km at Danau Girang Field Center in Sabah, Malaysia (Munds 2014).

Exceptions from prohibition can only be made for purpose of research, science, salvage of the animal species or in case the animal endangers the human life. In Brunei, Wildlife Protection Act (1981) states that slow lorises are protected species that cannot be hunted without a licence. In Wildlife Sanctuaries shooting, hunting, killing, capturing or taking any animal is completely prohibited. In Sabah Malaysia, it is a totally Protected Species as stated on the Wildlife Conservation Act (2010) Act 716. Zoos, commercial captive breeding, circus, wildlife exhibition, research and hunting of slow lorises needs a special permit. Trading of individuals or parts of them also needs a special permit. In the Philippines, it is protected by the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act (2001). Only accredited individuals can possess slow lorises for scientific, conservation or breeding purposes. Commercial breeding may be allowed if minimum requirements are provided.

In Sumatra <em>N. coucang</em> prefers secondary tree fall areas in primary rainforest, disturbed areas, and home gardens (Collins et al. 2008). Wild sightings of <em>N. coucang</em> are rare in southern Thailand (Osterberg and Nekaris 2015). In peninsular Malaysia <em>N. coucang</em> is largely found in tropical rain forest, dipterocarp forests, isolated forest patches adjacent to plantations, swamp forest, unlogged and selectively logged primary forest (Nekaris 2014; Barrett 1984; Wiens <em>et al</em>. 2006). Habitat of <em>N. coucang</em> in Singapore is largely made up of dipterocarp primary forest, and a combination of parks, scrubland, and various stages growing secondary forest (Fam <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; <span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></p>  <p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Home ranges of <em>N. coucang </em>in Malaysia varied from some 2 ha to 15 ha, depending on the forest type, with smaller home ranges in more primary forest. Males and females overlap in a uni-male, uni-female social system (Wiens and Zitzmann 2003). In Malaysia, social contact was rare. In captivity, however, the species can be housed socially and makes a wide array of contact calls, including a mother infant call unique to this species (Nekaris, unpublished). Exudates make up as much as 43 percent of this species’ diet; they consume animal prey, fruits, leaves, and bird eggs to make up remainder (Streicher <em>et al.</em> 2012; Weins <em>et al.</em> 2006). <em>N. coucang </em>are venomous, as are other members of the <em>Nycticebus</em> genus (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).    </span></p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species is collected for use as pets, and the animals are sold throughout Southeast Asia (Nekaris and Bearder 2011; Nekaris and Nijman 2007). The teeth are often pulled, resulting in infection and/or death. If animals survive, lack of teeth makes reintroduction impossible. Well-meaning rescue centres haphazardly reintroduce lorises into local forests without knowledge of their taxonomy or social needs (Nekaris and Starr, 2015). Sumatran populations are particularly impacted by the pet trade. The species is relatively adaptable to anthropogenic habitats, and so it might less affected by forest loss than some other primate species. Nevertheless, forest loss has been so severe in the region that it is likely to have had some negative impacts. Animals are shot as crop pests and for other reasons (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1994). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Lack of law enforcement further threatens slow loris species across their range (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2014).<span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></p>  <p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Release of invasive species is a major problem for this species. In Sumatra, slow lorises rescued from the pet trade comprising both the southern <em>N. coucang </em>and the northern <em>N. hilleri </em>have been introduced in large numbers in the South of the island. Releases (and escapes of captives) on to the island of Java is also problematic. In Singapore, some argue that only released animals persist (see below). In Thailand, what seems to be the natal range of<em> N. coucang, </em>the island of Phuket, is subject to rampant releases of <em>N. bengalensis. </em>Individuals perceive that such releases are merciful to the captive individuals, but the long-term threat of invasive species is known from many other mammalian taxa and could prove to be a great threat to slow lorises.</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""></p>  <p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">In Singapore inconsistent documentation of imports and exports of either <em>N. bengalensis, N. pygmaeus </em>or<em> N. coucang</em> between Laos, Japan and Singapore has contributed to the confusion surrounding which species are currently present in the wild (Fam <em>et al.</em> 2014). Listed as Critically Endangered in the Singapore Red Data Book, it is estimated that there are fewer than 50 mature individuals, OR if more than 50 mature individuals but less than 250, there is evidence of decline or fragmentation’ (Davison 2008).&#160; <span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></p>  <p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Though not as abundant as <em>N. bengalensis</em> in the Thai phot prop trade, Osterberg and Nekaris (2015) found two instances of <em>N. coucang</em> being used as photo props on Patong Beach. <em>N. coucang</em> populate rescue centres throughout their range but especially in Indonesia and Thailand; efforts to reintroduce suitable individuals are often hindered by a lack of knowledge regarding current population densities, the boundaries of the hybrid zones, and not prioritising post release monitoring (Nekaris and Starr 2015; Collins <em>et al.</em> 2008).

They can be found in disturbed habitats and in fragments with secondary forest, but as seed predators of large forest tree species (notably of the family Lecythidaceae), they tend to be in higher densities in mature forest. One possible explanation for their very large geographic distribution as a genus and as a species is their ability to use a range of forest types, from várzea to igapó to terra firma (Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Sakis are the smallest of the pitheciines, but are larger than other non-prehensile-tailed platyrrhines (<em>Aotus</em>, <em>Saimiri</em>, <em>Callicebus </em>and the Callitrichinae). Adults weigh 1.5–4.0 kg, but show a wide range in total body length (250–980 mm) and tail length (255–545 mm), reflecting the diversity between different taxa. Their tails are usually as long as the body, but in many species tails can be longer (&gt;100 mm; based on museum specimen data) in males and females. Size dimorphism is not striking but, depending on the species, females tend to be lighter in weight and smaller in overall size. Sakis are characterized by their long, coarse, fluffy hair that easily piloerects when they are approached in the wild, making them look bigger than they actually are. The hairs on the tail tend to be longer than on the back, but this varies among species, and the tail hair also ‘puffs up’ as a threat. Hairs on the trunk are always longer than those on the forearms and hind limbs. Underbellies are very lightly covered or bare. Coronal hairs are directed forward as a hood, and, depending on the species, overlap the facial region making them appear to have ‘bangs’. Both males and females have distinct throat glands for scent marking, with varying development depending on the species. Some males have obvious neck folds but others only a bare skin patch. Sakis are frugivorous seed predators (sakis are morphologically specialized for seed predation), but they eat insects such as army ants, as well as spiders, and other arthropods. Otherwise, their diet comprises seeds, fruit pulp, young leaves, insects and flowers. They vocalize in grunts, chirps, whistles, and low calls, but can be exceptionally quiet when sneaking away from a perceived threat such as a field researcher.<br/><br/>Movement Patterns: Locomotion consists of quadrupedal walking/ running, climbing and leaping. Members of this genus form small groups (2-9 individuals) which in some species may resemble a loose “fission-fusion” (Marsh pers. observ.) but core groups generally comprise a single male-female breeding pair and several young. Day ranges (1.5-2 km) and home ranges (10-25 km2) are small. Sakis exhibit behaviours associated with territory defence (Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Congregatory: Amazonian sakis are frequently seen in association (travelling, feeding and resting) with other primates such as <em>Callicebus</em>, <em>Alouatta</em>, <em>Ateles</em>, <em>Saimri</em>, <em>Saguinus</em>, <em>Lagothrix </em>(Marsh pers. observ.).","The main threats to <em>Pithecia milleri</em> are continued habitat loss, subsistence hunting and the associated live capture of young animals for the pet trade.","The population of this species is declining due to large-scale habitat loss and hunting in its distribution range. It is suspected that the population will decline by at least 30% over 30 years (2017-2047), based on accelerated rates of habitat loss within its Colombian range, in combination with continued subsistence hunting and associated live capture for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"In Colombia, <em>Pithecia milleri</em> is distributed from the foothills up to 500–700 m asl, from the surroundings of Florencia, east to the area of La Macarena, and south of the Rio Caqueta at least to Puerto Leguizamo. It is unclear where exactly the boundary with <em>P. hirsuta</em> lies (somewhere near Mecaya). According to Defler (2004) it occurs in the La Paya National Natural Park (422,000 ha) in Colombia. South of the Rio Putumayo it extends into Ecuador north of the Rio Napo but it is unclear how far it reaches east between the Napo and Putumayo Rivers. Since Miller’s sakis have been recorded in Cuyabeno in Ecuador, it might be possible that they could occur across the border west into Peru in the Zona Reservada Güeppi, north of the Rio Napo. However, until to date, there have been no records for that region.","All saki species are subject to hunting throughout their range.

However, Guanaco actual conservation measures continue to be primarily based upon recurring emergencies, <span lang=""EN-GB"">specifically<span lang=""EN-US"">, severe local poaching, which do not fulfill the greater holistic threats faced by the species.&#160; This is a result of its wide distribution existing in small-fragmented and isolated populations, in contrast to some abundant populations that are locally and widely distributed.<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/>Of grave concern <span lang=""EN-GB"">at the national level is that Guanacos are likely to become extinct in three out of the five countries where they were historically found and currently classified as Endangered: Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru.&#160; For this reason it is important to emphasize that future Guanaco management not only address the poaching problem, but also focus upon the implementation of measures orientated to the protection and conservation of those depressed populations, as well as, simultaneously expand the sustained utilization of those recovered and abundant populations for benefit of local residents and landowners. Accordingly, a more accurate classification of Guanaco, such as a Regional Assessment is needed in order to reflect the actual heterogeneity of populations across its multi-country distribution.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation due to overgrazing, competition with introduced herbivores, and habitat degradation due to extractive industries are the main threats to Guanaco (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Nevertheless, persistent illegal hunting is one of the historical threats to the species, independent of population size that is strongly impacting small and low-density populations <span lang=""EN-US"">(González 2010a,&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Wildlife Conservation Society 2012<span lang=""EN-US"">).&#160; Equally important is the continued hunting of numerically recovered populations (Lambertucci and Speziale 2011) based upon antagonism towards the species by livestock and landowners who have put pressure on governments to control Guanaco numbers.&#160; Examples of this situation occur in the Patagonia of Chile and Argentina, and populations in the Andes of Central Chile.<br/><br/>Human activities such as hunting, mining, oil exploration and extraction, livestock fencing, development of infrastructure, and habitat loss, often impose barriers to migration and movement between populations. The loss of connectivity has resulted in small, closed and isolated populations under increasing risk of collapse due to the loss of genetic variation and environmental or demographic stochasticity – the latter being highly relevant to inordinately small populations.&#160; Recent research, however, on a small island population of Guanacos indicates that such isolation may not be the problem of genetic-diversity loss in the short-term (70 years) as previously envisioned, yet long-term consequences are inevitable (<span lang=""EN-US"">González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/>Live-shearing of captured Guanacos is currently under development in Patagonia with Argentine-government funding. &#160;If properly managed, these programmes can offer an alternative to local economies and re-evaluation of negative attitudes by landowners towards the species (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, Lichtenstein and Carmanchahi 2012, Lichtenstein 2013). More than 11,000 Guanacos had been shorn between 2004-<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB"">2008, yet today only a very small percentage of the total Guanaco population is under such management (Lichtenstein 2013). The effects of sustained-fibre utilization are being assessed and monitored, especially where Guanacos are concentrated in scattered high-density populations (Ovejero <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Carmanchahi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). To encourage the marketing of Guanaco products, Argentina is developing and promoting Guanaco yarn and thread.<br/><br/>Guanacos have been legally hunted in Chile since 2003, with pressure for similar management in the Argentinean Patagonia in order to reduce density and conflicts with livestock production and forestry. However, a recent study revealed that hunting adult Guanacos by itself does not reduce browsing damage to <em>Nothofagus</em> regeneration in Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Martinez-Pastur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Still, government sanctioned and organized harvesting of Guanacos has resulted in the exportation of meat, contributed to the value of the species, and begun to reduce traditional conflict with sheep ranchers and foresters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a wild ungulate found from sea level to over 5,000 meters elevation (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, González in prep.). At the continental and country levels, climate has mainly driven distributional range of the species (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2013). Guanaco habitat is characterized by highly seasonal climates, dry winters or snow covered, cold temperatures including below zero, winds from moderate to high intensity and low precipitation combined with high evapotranspiration create arid conditions that in general result in low plant productivity (Franklin, 1982, 1983; Wheeler 1995).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In the sub-region of Patagonia (Hershkovitz 1972) Guanacos inhabit four of the ten major environments described for South America (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2006): 1) Desert and Xeric Shrublands, 2) Montane Grasslands, 3) Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and 4) Temperate Forests (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Phytogeographically, Guanacos inhabit the provinces of the Monte and Patagonia, arid and semi-arid shrublands, and grasslands comprising around 1,000,000 km² (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). On a smaller scale, the presence or absence of this species can be explained by altitude, vegetation, topography, and the occurrence of livestock (Travaini <em>et al. </em>2007, Acebes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Iranzo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, González <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/></span><br/>Both migratory and sedentary populations exist across the Guanaco range. Migration is mainly driven by winter forage supply and snow depth as observed for Andean and some Patagonian population before and after the reproductive season (Ortega and Franklin 1995). A minimal annual home range reported for the species is 2-9 km<sup>2 </sup>in sedentary animals (Marino and Baldi 2008), whereas in migratory populations they can reach up to 900 km<sup>2</sup> in the Andes (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008) and around 40 km<sup>2</sup> in Tierra del Fuego during winter (Moraga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The Guanaco’s primary natural predator is the Puma (<em>Puma concolor</em>; Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999) and secondarily the Andean Fox (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>; Novaro <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160; Its distribution overlaps marginally with other native ungulates such as Huemul (<em>Hippocamelus bisulcus</em>) in Patagonia, Taruka (<em>Hippocamelus anticensis</em>) in mountains of the central Andes, and the Vicuña (<em>Vicugna vicugna</em>) in some parts of the altiplano (Luccherini 1996, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Rundel and Palma 2000).<br/><br/>Adult Guanacos weigh 80-120 kg (Wheeler 1995, González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) and their breeding system is based upon resource defence polygyny, i.e. an adult male defends a territory where birthing and mating occur and a group of females and their offspring (chulengos) feed freely from the intrusion of other males (Franklin 1982, 1983). The Family Group is the basic social unit that occupies a Feeding Territory defended by the resident adult male. Other units found during the reproductive season, include Solo Males that defends a territory without females, and non-territorial Male Groups composed of males of various ages (Franklin 2011). In migratory populations outside the reproductive season, large Mixed Groups can be observed composed of both sexes of all ages (Ortega and Franklin 1995).<br/><br/>Vigilance and foraging accounted for almost 90% of the diurnal time budget for male and female Guanacos in Family Groups, where animals benefited from living in groups as individual foraging time increased with group size, as well as, collective vigilance against predators (Marino and Baldi 2008). Territoriality apparently limits population density, reaching lower K (equilibrium density) when contrasted with models based on individual forage intake (Marino <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Empirical field data has also shown that Family Group size is positively correlated with forage production within Feeding Territories (Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;in press).&#160;<br/><br/>Guanacos are generalist herbivores of intermediate selectivity, i.e. their diets include large proportions of both grasses and shrubs (Raedeke and Simmoneti 1988; Fraser 1998; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, 2011, 2014; Baldi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Domestic sheep was the main ungulate introduced across the Guanaco’s range, reaching 22 million within 50 years after its introduction in the Argentine Patagonia in the late 1800s. Guanacos and sheep largely overlap in their forage preferences as much as 80% in some areas (Puig<em> et al.&#160;</em>2001). Although both species can include some 100 plant species in their diets, only 17 species make up 80% of the diets, and in Patagonia two grass species represent 40% for both Guanaco and sheep diets (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Other introduced ungulates found in Guanaco habitat are goats, cattle, donkeys, and horses, but few studies have assessed their diet overlap with the Guanaco. A preliminary study in the Bolivian Chaco showed that the Guanaco is a generalist feeder, responding to the seasonal availability of fruits, flowers and leaves, including a variety of cacti (Cuéllar, unpublished data). In that same region Guanacos mainly compete for forage and spatial resources with cattle and horses.<br/><br/>Competition with livestock, hunting, and habitat modification has often resulted in Guanacos occupying marginal, low quality lands in terms of vegetation cover and the availability of preferred plant species caused by sheep monopolizing the most productive areas (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Iranzo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). A spatial segregation has been found in northern Chile between Guanacos and Donkeys <em>Equus asinus</em> (Malo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Guanacos are still numerous and widely distributed but continue their decline initiated in the 19th century in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and major parts of Chile. Over-hunting, range degradation from livestock overgrazing, and interspecific competition for forage have all played significant and long-time roles in the demise of Guanacos all across their distributional range (Raedeke 1979; Franklin 1982; Miller<em> et al. </em>1983; Cunazza <em>et al. </em>1995; Cuellar and Fuentes 2000; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, 2004). Currently, the main threats are still widespread, but mining and energy projects are also becoming a factor. Of special concern is the recent and rapid development of unconventional oil and gas exploration across large areas of the Guanaco’s distribution.<br/><br/>In Peru Guanacos are seriously affected by poaching and subsistence hunting. Habitat degradation due to extractive industries and livestock overgrazing has been identified as major threats for the few remaining subpopulations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).<br/><br/>In Bolivia the current major threat is habitat loss due to overgrazing by livestock. Although sport hunting was halted in 2001 (Cuéllar, unpublished data), poaching is still common.<br/><br/>In Chile and Argentina, recreational hunting and poaching are major threats. In northern Chile at the local level, feral dogs are reducing Guanaco populations within and outside protected areas, and hybridism with Llamas is common in areas with low Guanaco densities. Mining and oil extraction along with photovoltaic and wind parks have expanded with the demand for increased production, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation of populations in both countries.&#160; In addition, in northern Chile and the Argentine Patagonia infrastructure development has caused road kills and entrapment within barriers lining highways causing local isolation and limiting population movements <span lang=""EN-US"">(Rey<em> et al.</em><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;2012). Finally, in Chile and Argentina where numbers have recovered due to government sponsored management programs and Guanaco populations coexist with ranching and forestry practices, there has been a return to public resentment towards Guanacos as occurred in historical times. Demonstrated-sustained programs of Guanacos utilization that benefit the local economy and lower population numbers are needed if Guanaco are to be maintained.<br/></span></span><br/>Health studies conducted in mainland Patagonia have shown that Guanaco populations are relatively disease-free, but susceptible to common diseases from domestic sheep, cattle, and horses (Karesh <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Beldomenico<em> et al.</em> 2003, Uhart <em>et al.</em> unpub. data). Castillo (2006) came to a similar conclusion based upon studies of parasite load in free ranging Peruvian Guanacos. Recently, scabies has been reported to affect Guanacos in northern Chile causing mortality in low-density populations. It is also a common disease in Guanacos inhabiting Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Skewes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Today the Guanaco occupies only 26% of its original range (calculated by Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Specifically, range distribution has been reduced by 58% in Argentina, 75% in Chile, and over 90% in Perú, Bolivia, and Paraguay (<span lang=""EN-US"">Cunazza <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Moreover, distribution has become fragmented into smaller, relatively isolated populations. Although the species is not threatened with demographic extinction at a continental scale, it is predicted that the northern subspecies <em>L. guanicoe cacsilensis</em> will become extinct in Peru within 30 years if current-hunting mortality rates are not curtailed (<a href=""www.conopa.org"">www.conopa.org</a>). Guanacos are ecologically extinct in most of their remaining range (Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2000), with some southern populations at serious risk of local or even regional extirpation (Cunazza <em>et al.&#160;</em>1995). Spatial fragmentation in general is a threat to Guanaco populations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Recent findings suggest that inbreeding or aberrant mutations may lead to reproductive failure and congenital malformations (Franklin and Grigione 2005, Zapata <em>et al. </em>2008, González <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/></span><br/>Increasing pressure from private landowners in Patagonian rangelands may result in a threat to the remaining high-density Guanaco populations if management is not properly planned and implemented. Live-shearing and subsequent release of wild Guanacos could contribute to their conservation only if the effects of this activity are properly assessed and management is applied accordingly. If not ecologically sustainable, the viability of the most important Guanaco populations will be at risk. Careful evaluation of current management practices involving live shearing is currently in progress, but a long-term assessment is necessary. For Guanaco populations under a hunting strategy of use, information about habitat preferences, flight distance, individual and population movement, group composition, and the effect on neighbouring populations are urgently needed for proper assessment of this kind of productive system.<br/><br/>Land desertification due to overgrazing coupled with more severe and frequent droughts caused by climate change/variation are potential threats of great concern to Guanaco abundance throughout its range. Severe droughts can have drastic effects on local Guanaco populations as documented in eastern Patagonia (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In addition, models on climate change predict a sharp decrease in rain precipitation within the next 50 years in arid-southern South America (Nohara <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Therefore, it is crucial to favor the ecological functionality of Guanaco populations through adequate management as a step to mitigate additional effects of climate change.&#160;</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">It is estimated that Guanaco abundance has been reduced to only 3-7% of their original numbers when Europeans arrived to South America and the total Guanaco population was between 30-50 million animals (Raedeke 1979). Today, the total continental population of Guanacos is between 1,500,000-2,200,000 with the estimated number of adults between 1,000,000-1,500,000 (calculated from life-tables of Raedeke 1979; Fritz and Franklin 1994), two to three times greater than previously assessed (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">That number would be reduced if effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) is applied (Sarno <em>et al. </em>2015). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Some 81-86% of the Guanaco population is found in Argentina followed by Chile at 14-18%. The total numbers in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay are less than 1% of the total. Differences in survey methodologies and effort across such a vast area make it necessary to be cautious about population numbers and should be taken only as references. Specifically, what is needed is a more reliable estimate for the entire Argentine Patagonia (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For Chile the total estimate is rather speculative as these numbers come from scattered information instead of planned surveys.&#160; More accurate surveys will hopefully come from new methods applicable for population estimation designed for large areas (González 2010a) or application of standard methodologies at broad scale (Soto 2010). For Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay, most assessments have been based mainly on animal counts because of the large and remote areas involved, possibly underestimating total population size.<br/></span></span><br/>Although Guanaco distribution in the Argentine Patagonia is rather continuous, densities are typically low (&lt;5 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>) and even very low in many parts of Chubut, Rio Negro and Neuquén Provinces (&lt;2 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>). High-density populations are actually scarce in the Patagonia of Argentina (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, 2010; Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2007; Puig <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, 2003). A recent estimate for Patagonia was reported by Gavuzzo <em>et al.</em> (2015) applying aerial censuses techniques, but the numbers must be used for reference because of problematic assumptions, and used with caution if management decisions are at the local level (Schiavini and Rey 2015). Nevertheless, aerial surveys can agree with population estimation by modelling, for example those from the Santa Cruz Province (Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For the rest of Argentina, population densities are below one Guanaco/km² and highly fragmented (Baigún <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Puig and Videla 2007) with some relict populations in La Pampa, Córdoba and Buenos Aires Provinces (Sosa and Sarasola 2005, Barri and Cufré 2014). Some high-density populations occur in southern Chile reaching up to 43 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at Torres del Paine National Park (Sarno and Franklin 1999), but in the rest of Chile populations are small and widely scattered.<br/><br/>As a general rule, it is recommended to use the distance sampling methods either for ground or aerial surveys for open and flat environments, as they are based upon more realistic assumptions than total counts or fixed-width strip transect methods that tend to underestimate population numbers (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, where numbers are very low as in relict populations, total counts or less systematic methods are appropriate as a first approach. Also, extrapolation of local densities to larger areas must be cautiously applied according to sampling effort and based upon proper statistical design. Some large-scale surveys are currently being conducted in Argentinean Patagonia, including modelling (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and aerial surveys using systematic, digital photographs taken along flight transects. In Chilean mountainous environments survey techniques are in the experimental phase using Monte-Carlo modelling and geostatistical-based estimates.</p><p>Guanaco population:</p><p></p><ul><li>Peru: 3,000</li><li>Bolivia: 150-200</li><li>Paraguay: 20-100</li><li>Chile: 270,000-299,000</li><li>Argentina: 1,225,000-1,890,000</li></ul>Total&#160;Guanaco population: 1,498,170-2,192,300<p></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Trend:&#160; Increasing. Although the global population estimate is higher than previous assessments, current approaches take into account new information and methods of estimation (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Zubillaga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em> 2015). <span lang=""EN-US"">Under-estimates and over-estimates have occurred in the past because of incomplete and inaccurate population-survey methodologies, especially in low population densities over the vast areas involved.&#160; <span lang=""EN-GB"">Also, some large areas previously unknown have been recently surveyed.&#160; At the same time, high-numbered populations in the Argentine and Chilean Patagonia have experienced significant growth in the past number of years <span lang=""EN-US"">(Zubillaga <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, caution should be noted that although numbers have seemingly increased in the far southern cone of South America, in the balance of the Guanaco’s distribution, populations are small and in real decline or at best tenuously stable, such as in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Chile, and Nnrthern Argentina (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).</span></span></p>",Increasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a widespread species with an extensive, although discontinuous, range from the northern Peru (8°30’ S) to Navarino Island (55°S) in southern Chile, from the Pacific Ocean in the northwest to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast, and from the sea level to 5,000 meters elevation in the Andean Mountains (Franklin 1982, González<em> et al. </em>2006, González in prep.).<br/><br/>However, its distribution has been severely impacted by human beings. Constant hunting, human occupation and fragmentation of habitat, competition with livestock, and the installation of fences (<span lang=""EN-US"">Torres 1992, Franklin <em>et al. </em>1997, González <em>et al. </em>2006) have reduced the Guanaco’s distribution to only 26% of its original distribution (calculated by Ceballos <span lang=""EN-US"">and<span lang=""EN-US""> Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Clearly numerous local populations have become extirpated generating a distribution highly fragmented in many regions (Housse 1930, MacDonagh 1949, Mann <em>et al. </em>1953, Cunazza<em> et al. </em>1995, Torres 1992, González <em>et al. </em>2006, Baigún <em>et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>In Peru the northernmost population of Guanacos in South America occurs at 8°30'S (Franklin 1975, Linares <em>et al. </em>2010) in the Calipuy National Reserve in the La Libertad Department. To the south, populations reach the Salinas Aguada Blanca National Reserve in the departments of Arequipa and Moquegua (16°10'S), and a Guanaco population has been recorded in the Nevado Salcantay area in the Anta District (Wheeler 2006, Veliz and Hoces 2007).<br/><br/>In Bolivia, a relict population of Guanaco persists in the Chaco region (Cuéllar and Fuentes 2000) and recent sightings have been reported in the southern highlands between Potosi and Chuquisaca (Nuñez 2008). Although Pinaya (1990) reported the presence of Guanacos in southeastern Tarija, these records are in need of confirmation.<br/><br/>In Paraguay, a small relict population has been reported in the northwestern Chaco (Villalba 2004).<br/><br/>In Chile Guanacos occur from near Putre village at the northern border with Peru to Navarino Island in the far southern Fueguian zone (González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The largest Guanaco populations in Chile are concentrated in the Magallanes and Aysén regions in the far south.&#160; In the remainder of the country, small and fragmented Guanaco populations occur in the Andean foothills of the extreme north, scattered small pockets along the coast, the north-central zone in the lower Andes, and central Chile exclusively in the Andes (González 2010a, González<em> et al.&#160;</em>2013).<br/><br/>In Argentina most of the world’s remaining Guanacos are found. Although its range covers nearly all of the Argentine Patagonia, Guanaco populations appear to be more scattered towards the northern provinces of the country (Chubut, Río Negro, Neuquén, and Mendoza) compared to the southern region (Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego; Baigun <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Throughout northern Patagonia, distribution is highly fragmented in relict populations in the La Pampa and southwestern Buenos Aires Provinces. In central and northern Argentina, Guanaco distribution is restricted to the western half of the country along the pre-Andean and Andean mountains up to the border with Bolivia (Baigún <em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recently a relict population has been reported in the arid Chaco of northwestern Córdoba (Schneider <em>et al</em>. unpublished data) and in Córdoba Guanacos have been reintroduced (Barri and Cufré 2014).</span></span></p>","<p>The call for the management and wise use of Guanaco products (fine undercoat/fiber and meat) put forth over the past several decades as an alternative approach to traditional conservation and strict protection (Franklin and Fritz 1991, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 1997) is now in the pioneering stages trying to establish itself as a wildlife production system (Hudson 1989). Research and application of meat harvest programs have been conducted on Tierra del Fuego, Chile, after monitoring population (Skewes<em> et al.</em>&#160;1999, Skewes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Soto 2010). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Nearly 23,000 animals have been harvested for meat between 2003 and 2015 in Chilean Tierra del Fuego with products primarily exported or used in the local market (N. Soto, pers. com. 2016). <span lang=""EN-US"">Fiber utilization was achieved initially from Guanaco farm individuals captured in the wild as newborns and raised in captivity during the 1980s and 1990s (Bas and González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000), but this approach has largely been discontinued because of high husbandry costs and world instability in the specialty-fiber market.&#160; Another approach, as mentioned above, holds more long-term promise from capturing, shearing and releasing of individuals in wild populations in programs being developed in Argentina. Finally, non-consumptive use, such as tourism, has also helped promote the aesthetic value of the species, especially in wild protected areas (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997).<br/></span><br/>A major management program funded by the government is currently being developed in the Patagonia of Argentina for fine-fiber utilization of wild-live captured animals on protected areas. This type of management was at its height during the last decade between 2004-2008 when some 11,000 Guanacos were shorn (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Lichtenstein 2013). Since then the number of animals has decreased due to international price variations for crude fiber. As a result, there has been a strong incentive to generate Guanaco fiber products as the local level, including yarn and thread (Lichtenstein pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services and Values<br/></strong>The importance of the Guanaco is based upon a multiple set of values (González 2010b). The most basic is its ecocentric or intrinsic value, that is, as a species its right to live, to exist, independent of the importance of the species to humans. This is an ethical base tangentially related to different groups and non-government organizations within the protective laws of each country.<br/><br/>There are a myriad of anthropocentric values that refer to the importance of a species to humans. The species provides multiple benefits to society, or ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) that are imparted to different segments of human society (Ojasti 2000). Guanacos provide regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services at different time and space scales. The benefits of the Guanaco to humans can be assessed by a number of values:</p><p></p><ul><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Existence Value&#160;</strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">that can be achieved through investment or payment to insure the existence of Guanaco populations without assumptions for its later use, is still in the beginning stages for this species.&#160; Nevertheless, the work of private organizations like Wildlife Foundation, Patagonia Conservation, and the Wildlife Conservation Society have indirectly assured the Guanaco’s future by acquiring large-land holdings for the conservation of ecosystems that include the species.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Evolutionary Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>through the Guanaco’s heritage of nearly 40 million years of evolution from its ancestors in North American (Franklin 1982, in press) and its anatomical and physiological adaptations (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), its adaptiveness has enabled the species to become the dominate-wild mammal in Patagonia and parts of the Andean mountains of South America (Franklin 2011).

It has been observed that in the absence of this large herbivore, the Puma will consume other prey that are of importance to humans, namely domestic sheep (Novaro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Laguna <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The Guanaco modifies plant growth in such a way that reduces dry matter prone to fire (Fuentes and Muñoz 1995) and disseminates seeds through the use of dung piles that promotes the recycling of nutrients and colonization of degraded soils (Cortés <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Henríquez 2004, Cavieres and Fajardo 2005). In addition, the padded feet of Guanacos do far less damage to soft soils compared to cloven hoofed livestock (König <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, König <em>et al</em>. 2015). They are also an important prey of predators and their remains are significant to scavenging animals, all of which contribute to ecosystem health and cycles.</span></li><li><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">Productive <span lang=""EN-GB"">Value</span></strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>,</strong> applies to a number managed Guanaco populations for the important production of fibre (hair) and meat (see section on Use and Trade). Guanaco fibre is extremely fine (14-16 microns) and potentially economically valuable, as currently being obtained from live capture and release programs in the Patagonia of Argentina. Also, the value of its meat is being harvested from populations in Tierra del Fuego, Chile.</li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Ethnic Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong> </strong>of the Guanaco is high as an invaluable species that has permitted the existence of humans in a variety of remote and dry environments of South America (Franklin 1982). All indigenous cultures associated with the deserts, Andean mountains, and the Patagonian and Fuegian zones utilized the Guanaco, and in some cases depended upon the species for food, clothing, shelter, and artistic and spiritual inspiration (Miller 1982). Its ethnic value was paramount, thanks to the process of domestication in the Central Andes, in the creation of the domestic Llama (Wheeler 1995). The Guanaco has also been seen to have local aesthetic value (Barkmann <em>et al</em>. 2005, Cerda <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Conservation Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""> of the Guanaco has been successfully used as an indicator, sentry, flag, and charismatic species (Noss 1990) in several parts of its distribution (Chehebar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). It has also been used to justify the creation of wild areas and for environmental variations as a “sensitive species” for monitoring changes in land use (González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Restoration Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""> is the examination of costs for preventing the Guanaco’s disappearance and/or the costs of re-establishing extirpated populations, as was the case in Argentina (Barri and Cufré 2014).</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Option Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-GB"">is the costs of determining the attitudes of people or society to pay for Guanaco conservation as a potential resource for future use, of which, has not yet been assessed.</span></span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Recreational-Tourism Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">, whereas the Guanaco is an animal of large-showy size in open ecosystems, with its gregarious habits, tolerance and habituation to people when not under persecution makes the species an important attraction for tourists who visit wild-protected national parks and refuges (Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Cerda and De la Maza 2015).</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Historic Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">, for having been recognized in stories of early arriving Europeans, historians, and naturalists, such as Charles Darwin who was surprised by the large numbers of Guanacos, its habits, and widespread occurrence across different areas of South America, the species is historically important.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Artistic and Literary Value</strong>,<span lang=""EN-GB""> because the Guanaco has been mentioned by historical and contemporary writers, for example Gabriel Garcia Marquez who at the time of receiving the Nobel prize of Literature in 1982, used the description done by A.

Also, Pablo Neruda in his work “Canto General” (<em>General Song</em> in English) of 1950, dedicated words to the Guanaco in several of his poems. In addition, the Guanaco has been featured in major popular magazine articles and a number of television specials and documentaries by Nova, Nature, Discovery and National Geographic seen by multi-millions of people (see for details <a href=""http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf"">http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf</a>).</span></li></ul><p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco occurs in a number of protected areas and is included in Appendix II of CITES, thus regulating its international commerce of meat and fine-fiber products to insure that such trade does not threaten the Guanaco’s survival. &#160;In selected areas the sale of Guanaco products in local and international markets has contributed to its “species value” in recovered populations that can be used for reducing human-Guanaco conflict with ranchers and forestry production.&#160; Precaution needs to keep in mind for numerically depressed populations where consumptive and commerce use could irreversibly affect population stability; because of such potential problems, national legislation and international control via CITIES and other programs are relevant and important.<span lang=""EN-US""></span></p><p></p><ul><li>Peru. Recent legislation ratifies the alarming status of the Guanaco in Peru classifying it as Critically Endangered (Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego 2014). Governmental management of populations has been changed from CONACS (Consejo Nacional de Camélidos Sudamericanos = National Council for South American Camelids) to SERFOR (Servicio Forestal = Forestry Service) and local communities.</li><li>Bolivia. The government is working with local NGOs and authorities to strengthen the management of protected areas for the species. The government has issued an official notice to law enforcement offices in relevant regions concerning the protection of the Guanaco. The main conservation aim has been achieved thanks to the permanent presence of trained indigenous parabiologists and park rangers in the remaining range of the species (Cuéllar unpub. data). The situation is similar in Paraguay were the population is very small and the local NGOs and governmental institutions are working to maintain and protect the last remaining populations of Guanacos in the country.</li><li>Chile. The species is protected by the National Hunting Law (Ley de Caza) that regulates hunting, breeding, and in situ use. However, personnel for law enforcement are insufficient. Only 4% of the country’s Guanaco habitat has effective protection (8,354 km<sup>2</sup> in 8 National Parks and 4 Reserves). Additionally, there are fiscal and private areas where hunting is prohibited, either with relict populations (7,750 km<sup>2</sup>) or that directly protect the species (1,212 km<sup>2</sup>). A National Management Plan does not exist, but regionally a Conservation Plan has been developed for northern and central Chile (Grimberg 2010). Finally, Guanacos have been classified as Vulnerable in northern and central Chile and Least Concern in southernmost Chile by the Environmental Ministry (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente 2012), where the Guanaco is included in environmental assessment of investment projects such as mining, energy, infrastructure, and others.</li><li>Argentina. A National Management Plan (Plan Nacional de Manejo del Guanaco, Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) was prepared in 2006 and endorsed by the provinces with the highest Guanaco densities. The plan was coordinated by the Federal Wildlife Agency (Dirección de Fauna Silvestre) involving local institutions with its main focus on the Patagonia. The Federal Wildlife Conservation Law (Ley Nacional de Conservación de la Fauna) and various provincial acts provide a legal basis for the protection and use of the species. In Patagonia, Guanaco conservation measures include sustainable use of the species in the wild, regulation of hunting, and closing of some access routes and oil trails. Nevertheless, law enforcement capacity is low since most provinces lack sufficient personnel and equipment to control vast areas. Protected areas in the Patagonian steppe would encompass 10% of the Guanaco population if effective, but most protected areas are rather nominal as they contain livestock, lack wildlife guards, and poaching is common. The percentage of the area under effective protection in the Patagonian steppe is estimated at a disconcerting level of less than 1% (Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). In the central provinces there are eleven protected areas (national, provincial and private). In general, progress has been made in legislation and management tools, but implementation is needed.</li></ul><p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is not found in the Amazon region and it avoids dense forests in other regions as well, although it occupies the edges of forests. It does not live in open areas but will feed in these areas, including many types of agricultural plantations, if cover is available nearby. It is found in both dry and moist Chaco regions (Cartes 1998, Chiarello 1999, Gonzalez 2004, Pinder 1997, Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997, Rivero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>It eats  a wide variety of plant species and is a selective feeder. It has pulses of frugivory depending on the area, season and availability of frutis, but is not essentially frugiverous in many areas, its habitat is not consistent with a frugivorous diet since it avoids forests where most of the fruit is found (Caballero 2001, Cartes 1998, Julia 2002, Pinder 1997, Stallings 1984).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs almost all year around with births in all months except May, June and July in Argentina and Bolivia and correlated with the rainy season in Brazil (Chavez 1999, Julia 2002).

In Brazil, regional, ecological and individual variations in coloration of <em>M. gouazoubira</em> have frequently been reported (Duarte 1996, Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997, Rossi 2000). Light and brownish colors prevail in individuals living in grasslands, while forest populations tend to be darker and grayer, significant individual variation exists within a single population. <em>M. gouazoubira</em> can be readily distinguished from the most similar species, the Amazonian Brown Brocket <em>Mazama nemorivaga</em>, by its orange rump and dorsal side of the tail, larger rounded ears, smaller eyes and orbital cavities, and wider auditory bulla rather than chocolate brown rump and dorsal side of the tail, small pointed ears, large eyes, large orbital cavities, and narrow auditory bulla of the latter species (Duarte 1996, Rossi 2000).","In Argentina populations are generally declining due to hunting pressure and habitat loss. International hunting expeditions are organized in Argentina (Julia 2002). In Bolivia the populations seem to be staying constant in spite of great hunting pressure. In Brazil this is the most abundant deer species in the country, but populations are declining in certain areas (Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro). In Paraguay, the populations in general are remaining constant, but the species has disappeared from recently urbanized areas and areas of high human density. In general there is heaving hunting pressure and loss of animals due to kills by dogs as well as habitat loss.","Populations seem to be decreasing due to the advance of human populations. There is no evidence of fragmented populations and the species continues to be abundant in most of its range, decreasing or disappearing when close to human populations. Densities vary greatly.

22156866,41789,Rusa timorensis,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Javan Deer is still locally common within its rather small native geographic range, but is assessed as Vulnerable (C1) because its total native population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within three generations (estimated as a minimum of 15 years) as a result of habitat loss, habitat degradation, and poaching. The rise in hunting reflects institutional and socio-economic factors which are not readily reversible and therefore speedy solution is unlikely. Open-country herding deer are very susceptible to inadequately managed hunting in tropical Asia. This decline is continuing, except in national parks and inaccessible areas, but increased government surveillance and lower numbers of animals has meant that loss due to hunting is decreasing. The main threat now appears to be loss of habitat (G. Dryden pers. comm. 2014).","This is essentially a tropical and subtropical grassland species (Medway 1977; Oka 1998) but is highly flexible, with successful populations in forests, mountains, shrublands and marshes (Whitehead 1993, Oka 1998, Rouys and Theuerkauf 2003, Keith and Pellow 2005). It is found from sea-level to 900 m asl (G. Semiadi pers. comm., S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Some subpopulations make seasonal movements; for example, on New Guinea numbers in the border area between West Papua and Papua New Guinea peak during the wet season, whereas in the dry season many move to the interior of Papua New Guinea (Semiadi 2006).<br/><br/>In diet it is&#160;adaptable, as indicated by its dentition and mouth shape (Dryden and Bisseling 1999),&#160;and will eat herbs, the leaves and bark of shrubs, and even seaweed (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998, Keith and Pellow 2005), although it seems to prefer certain types of grass (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998), including in its native range (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). In New Caledonia and Australia, it is a threat to native trees (de Garine-Wichatitsky <em>et al</em>. 2005, Keith and Pellow 2005). In the Torres Strait Islands, mating occurs during spring (September-October) and calves are born in autumn (April-May). In other parts of Australia, Javan Deer seems to breed at any time of the year, with a mating peak from late June to August, and a calving peak from March to April (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Indonesia it is said to breed all year around (Whitehead 1993), although a June-September increase in mating activity was found in Bali (Oka 1998), and in Java there is a peak of mating behaviour between July and September (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Where hunting or other disturbance is not a big problem, Javan Deer are primarily diurnal, gathering in large groups in open areas at night. The rut tends to involve a lot of nocturnal activity, even in undisturbed/low hunting areas (Oka 1998, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 based on observations in East Java). Javan Deer are more social than their congeners (Kitchener <em>et al. </em>1990). Herds are segregated by sex, except during the mating season, and may comprise up to 25 individuals (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 1990).","Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting long-standing high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""wildlife reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other offtake, but the national parks of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Javan Deer and, at least into the mid 1990s, very large populations) remained remarkably intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some small game, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Javan Deer and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the peoples' resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ""tragedy of the commons"", has indeed led to increased habitat destruction and poaching in the past decade. The Javan Deer, as a large deer, is particularly threatened by this rapid rise in illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008) and also by expansion of agriculture on Java and other forms of encroachment (G. Semiadi pers. comm.; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008.). In Java, this deer is poached with snares and dogs, but mostly with guns in the late 1990s and 2000s (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The Javan Deer is now seen as a source of extra income and of animal protein by many local communities despite being legally protected (Semiadi 2006) and coupled with the decentralisation of conservation management decisions and actions, macro-economic fluctuations and reduced authority of The Law, this impedes control of illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Poaching has reportedly reduced numbers at Baluran National Park, formerly the largest population within the native range, and more widely across Java, but data are insufficient to determine rate of decline (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008). Similar trends are likely on Bali. In the rest of its Indonesian range, e.g. Sulawesi, where it is introduced and thus populations are not used in assessing the Red List Category, it is also heavily hunted and there were major population declines in the late 1990s, although at least on Sulawesi the population is now in slow recovery (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Poaching of this species in its native range is for meat, medicinal products (some traded internationally), handicrafts products, and, locally, pets.<br/><br/>During the 1980s-1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Javan Deer in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree <em>Acacia nilotica</em> (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt  to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park's monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that conta<em>in litt</em>le or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the deer to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camara</em> (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Javan Deer habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).","<p>The Javan Rusa is common in much of its current range (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992, Whitehead 1993, Heinsohn 2003, Moriarty 2004). Most populations are outside the native range (Corbet and Hill 1992, Whitehead 1993, Heinsohn 2003, Moriarty 2004), including some of the most buoyant: New Caledonia (de Garine-Wichatitsky <em>et al</em>. 2004), where the population is at least 120,000 (Desvals <em>et al.</em> 1992); Mauritius where numerous at circa 60,000, and an ecological problem (R.J. Safford <em>in litt</em>. 2008); Sulawesi and the Maluku islands (Indonesia; G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008), Pulau Moyo (= Moyo island, a small island in the eastern part of Nusa Tenggara Timur, where deer are protected by local people; G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and West Papua, Indonesia (over 8,000 estimated in Wasur National Park alone, in 1992; Anon. 1994). 4000 Javan Rusas were introduced from New Caledonia in the 1990s and are said to be expanding (Maudet 1999). There are sizeable populations (5,000 to 10,000 animals) located in New South Wales, Australia, and several small (&lt;100 animals) wild herds in the coastal areas of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland (Moriarty 2004). The Rusa population was estimated to be 16,000 in 2000 (Moriarty 2004). Wild herd sizes appear to be increasing, as indicated by encroachment of Rusas into peri-urban areas in Sydney and Brisbane. A small population of Javan Rusa was introduced to the North Island of New Zealand, which is reportedly unlikely to expand (Fraser <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000).</p><p><br/></p>Conversely, populations have decreased substantially in some areas on Java, where it is a native (Semiadi 2006), including Baluran National Park which (at least in the 1990s) held the largest Javan Rusa population within its natural range. In 1996, 2,500-3,000 Javan Rusas were counted during a census when multiple teams of observers deployed simultaneously throughout deer habitat (Anonymous 1996, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Between 12 September 1998 and 18 January 1999, the population was thought to be greater than 1,000 head and it is very likely to have declined still further. Major declines have also occurred in Alas Purwo National Pak (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Even in the 1980s-mid 1990s, Bali had very few populations, probably only one of significance: in Bali Barat National Park (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). There are probably no more than ten populations in the native range (= Java and Bali) and given the size of the Baluran population, it is implausible that there could be more than 10,000 mature individuals within the native range (which would imply a census population of about 13,000-20,000) even in the mid-1990s (S.

Some introductions apparently took place in antiquity within present-day Indonesia, to the Lesser Sunda islands, Maluku (= Molucca) islands (including Buru and Seram), Sulawesi, and Timor. On Timor, the species inhabits both West Timor (part of Indonesia) and Timor Leste (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008, based on 1998 data). Indonesian islands with introduced populations include: Alor, Ambon, Banda, Batjan, Buru, Butung, Flores, Halmahera, Komodo, Lembeh, Lombok, Mangole, Muna, Papua, Sanana, Saparua, Seram, Sulawesi, Sumba, Sumbawa, Taliabu, Ternate, Timor, and Wetar (Wiradteti pers. comm.). Like many large deer, the Javan Rusa is an able swimmer (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990), hindering determination of its native range. The originally introduced population in Borneo is now probably extinct (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008), but in the 1990s soldiers returning from Timor brought some Javan Rusas to at least the Tanah Grgot and Penajam Paser Utara districts in East Kalimantan. Hybridization of Sambar <em>R. unicolor</em> (which occurs naturally in Borneo) with the introduced Javan Rusas has been confirmed from molecular and morphology in one captive herd (221 heads) belonging to the East Kalimantan Province's Animal Husbandry Office at Penajam Paser Utara district (G.

Also seven (individual) Red Deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em> were introduced from France; the final outcome with the latter (including any hybridization with Javan Rusas which may or may not have occurred) is unknown but nowadays 'deer' are not common on Réunion, although they are still present in a few areas, and are a pest where they occur. Rodrigues holds no Javan Rusas, although there was a failed attempt to introduce them (Cheke and Hume 2008). Introductions have been made in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to New Zealand (1907, Fraser <em>et al.</em> 2000), Malaysia (1993/4), and to Brazil, Madagascar and Thailand (Maudet 1999). Javan Rusas were introduced to the Port Moresby region of Papua New Guinea from Java in 1900 (Maudet 1999) and a small population has persisted there and has spread north into the Owen Stanley Range with a herd near Wewak on the north coast; introductions to islands of the Bismarck Archipelago have either not persisted or are present in small numbers (Mammals of Papua 2009-2014).

On Madagascar, Javan Rusas were introduced near Périnet (Andasibe) around 1930, survived until at least 1955 but is now extirpated, probably having disappeared in the 1960s (Goodman and Benstead 2003: 1172-1173).

Commonly firearms are the weapon of choice for this type of game.<br/><br/>The species is commercially farmed in Australia, New Caledonia, Mauritius, Réunion, and Thailand (de Vos 1982, le Bel 1997) and has been farmed experimentally in Indonesia (Java) and Papua New Guinea (de Vos 1982, Tapari 1990). Farming is mainly for venison and velvet. It is also hunted for its meat (and velvet) in many parts of Indonesia, New Guinea and New Caledonia (Semiadi 2006).

22158006,41783,Axis axis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Chital is listed as Least Concern because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large subpopulations. Although it is still declining in some sites (particularly outside protected areas), at the species level any such declines are at nowhere near the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. Historical declines may have been higher, but these occurred outside of the three generation window (&lt;30 years) used for purposes of applying Red List Criteria. Listing as Least Concern recognizes that there are two significant conservation issues with this species. Firstly, current densities are mostly well below what the habitat could support (and have been for decades), and secondly, the long-term persistence of nearly all subpopulations is dependent upon well secured protected areas: anything which caused the breakdown of current effective protection would allow a rapid rise in hunting levels and perhaps of domestic stock-grazing. These are the factors with which current Chital numbers are in an uneasy and fragile relationship. If such changes were to occur across a significant part of the range, reassessment of Red List status would be required: without effective protection, Chital’s population trend would emulate that of Eld's Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em>, another herding deer of rather open forests, but with a geographic range covering areas without long-standing effective protected areas. Regular monitoring of the status of Chital subpopulations would be prudent for this species.","Chital thrive in a variety of habitats, but avoid extremes such as dense moist (evergreen) forests and open semi-desert or desert. Moist and dry deciduous forest areas, especially adjoining dry thorn scrub or grasslands, appear to be optimal, and highest densities of Chital are reported from these habitats. Short grasslands of the terai, swampy meadows and glades adjoining forest areas, coastal dry evergreen forests, mixed forests or plantations with Teak Tectona grandis and Sal Shorea robusta are also used, and indeed over much of northern and southern India, its distribution closely matches that of Sal and Teak, respectively (Raman 2013). Chital is particularly frequent in grassland–forest interface, edge, and other ecotones (Krishnan 1972). Eisenberg and Seidensticker (1976) opined that dry deciduous habitats with scrub is the favoured habitat, while Karanth and Sunquist (1992) found mixed forests with teak plantations, moist deciduous patches and swampy grasslands to support high abundance of Chital. Kumar (2010) found that well-watered and well-protected moist deciduous forest patches in gently undulating terrain supported high Chital densities. Short grasslands are important because they provide little cover for predators such as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (Moe and Wegge 1994). The introduced subpopulation in Andaman Islands inhabits evergreen forests (Sankar and Acharya 2004) but native subpopulations are absent from the rainforest areas of the mainland. They tend to be only visitors to dense forests, to those adjoining more open habitats. Riverine forests within the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal are highly used by the deer for shade and cover during the dry season. The forest also provides good foraging with regard to fallen fruit and leaves that are high in nutrients needed by the deer. Four factors were identified by Schaller (1967) as delineating Chital’s distribution: (1) the need for water; (2) the need for shade; (3) an avoidance of high, rugged terrain; and (4) a preference for grass as forage. Although several observers have noted that Chital occurs mostly in flat areas and avoids hills and slopes (Schaller 1967, Khan 1996), this may not hold in areas where preferred habitats or forage is also available on slopes (Raman 2013, Kumar 2010). It occurs in both hilly and flatter terrain, mainly the latter, in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Siwalik hills, Bhat and Rawat (1995) found that Chital preferred slopes of 11–30°, while slopes exceeding 30° were used less. Also, use of south, southeast, and east aspects was higher than of north, northeast, northwest, and west aspects, reflecting the warmer environment of the former aspects. There was no difference in average Chital density in the hills and plains (Bhat and Rawat 1995). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Chital widely, including in coffee areas up to 14 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat use varies seasonally, reflecting food availability. Chital uses more wooded habitat during the cool-dry season and early summer (November to May), where fallen fruit, leaf litter, and browse are available. In open grassland and tropical dry thorn forest, Chital density increases with the onset of monsoon rains and flush of plant growth (Mishra 1982, Moe and Wegge 1994, Khan 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). In areas of their distribution with a mosaic of forest and grassland habitats, seasonal patterns in habitat use may be complex. In the Himalayan terai, Chital use of habitats with high grass availability increased substantially in the weeks following cutting and burning of grasses in January–February, attributed to fresh flush of grass growth after the burns and with the onset pre-monsoon and monsoon rains nearly two months later (Mishra 1982; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997). Similar behaviour has been reported from the grasslands of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh 1983).<br/><br/>Chital easily habituates to human presence, and herds often congregate in open areas near habitation or forest camps to spend the night, possibly due to greater safety from predators and poachers that shy away from these areas (Raman 2013).<br/><br/>Chital eats a wide variety of plants: about 160–190 have been recorded from across the species' range. It is predominantly a grazer but consumes more fallen leaves, flowers and fruits in winter/dry season (Sankar 1994, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Raman 2013). In addition to plant soft matter, crabs (in the Sunderbans; Stanford 1951), mushrooms (in Nepal; Moe and Wegge 1994) and rarely, bark (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996) are eaten. Close to human habitation, rubbish and even human faeces are occasionally taken (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Antler and bone chewing is also common. In Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, all age and sex classes are osteophagous, but such feeding was more common in velvet-antlered males, doubtless reflecting mineral needs during antler growth and mineralisation (Barrette 1985). Chital usually drinks water once a day, more frequently in summer. This restricts them to forest tracts with assured presence of water, even if only widely scattered.<br/><br/>In lowland Nepal, an individual’s total range incorporates a core area of about 32 hectares surrounded by foraging and cover areas of about 140 ha for females and 195 ha for males (Moe and Wegge 1994). Variation in range size occurs with site, season, sex and age of the animal. The basic social unit is a matriarchal family group, normally consisting of an adult female, her offspring from the previous year, and a fawn (Ables 1974). The usual herd is composed of two or more such family units and is often accompanied by individual deer of mixed sex and age-classes. Chital exhibits a fission-fusion system, or fluid group formation and dissolution (Schaller 1967, Mishra 1982, Barette 1991). Group composition changes frequently during feeding periods, during the rut when males frequently join groups of females (Schaller 1967), and while fleeing from predators (Dinerstein 1980). These social groupings of Chital do not remain permanent (Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972). Groups may number up to 150 or more individuals (De and Spillit 1966, Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Krishnan 1972, Fuchs 1977, Karanth and Sunquist 1992), sometimes even more: N.S. Kumar (pers. comm. 2008) counted 211 in one group during rainy season in Nagarahole and 203 in one group at Pench-Maharashtra near a water reservoir in summer. Measured sex ratios have all been biased towards females (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Pariwakam (2006) observed nearly 10,500 Chital in Bandipur and estimated the proportion of Chital in different age and sex classes as stags 27%, does 57% and fawns 16%. In neighbouring Nagarahole, age-sex categories of Chital were adult stags 26%, adult does 36%, yearling males 8%, yearling females 9% and young 21% (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). Breeding can occur at any time of year but there is some peaking at any given locality (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Heavy mortality of fawns in early weeks has been observed by several workers and fawn survival appears to be a key determinant of Chital population growth (Schaller 1967). Schaller (1967) estimated an annual fawn mortality of 48% in Kanha, Sharathchandra, and Gadgil (1975) estimated a constant monthly mortality of 26% over first nine months in Bandipur, Raman (1996) estimated a mean monthly mortality of 9.7% in Guindy. Pariwakam (2006) for the first time used a rigorous photographic capture-recapture approach to estimate the fawn mortality rate, and found it to be 66% over a six week study period in Bandipur. Further information on sociality and breeding is synthesised by Sankar and Acharya (2004) and by Raman (2013). Over a 10-year time period, Karanth and Kumar (unpublished data) have observed annual fluctuations in the Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole and Bandipur ranging between population densities of 10 to 40 animals per km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Chital is a prolific breeder, as documented by several empirical studies of the speed of increase by newly introduced subpopulations or in those where a factor restraining subpopulations was removed (Raman 2013 and references therein). In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole. This and its diverse diet and habitats allow high density where threats are controlled. It is even considered to be a pest in the Andamans (Banerji 1955).<br/><br/>The main causes of death are predation, diseases and accidents. Occasionally, stags kill each other when fighting (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Predation is by far the major cause of Chital mortality. Older Chital stags are more susceptible to it than are younger stags (Johnsingh 1983, Patel 1992, Karanth and Sunquist 1995). This may be due to their being less vigilant during rut, to their separation from the group after the rut, or to weakening from injuries from conflicts. In Kanha, Chital remains were found in about 52% of Tiger faeces and 59% of Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> faeces analysed (Schaller 1967). In Bandipur, Chital is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Dhole (78%), Leopard (55%) and Tiger (19%; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even in terms of the relative number of individuals taken, Chital is the predominant prey among the three large sympatric predators (Tigers about 33%, Leopards about 39% and Dholes about 73% in Bandipur; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole remains were found in about 31% of Tiger faeces, 44% of Leopard faeces, and 50% of Dhole faeces (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Sariska, around 54% of the faeces of Tiger and 21% of Leopard faeces contained Chital remains (Sankar 1994). Chital remains were found in about 53% of Tiger faeces in Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002) and 61% of Tiger faeces in Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Each Chital spends a major portion of its life in foraging, resting, and wandering within its range, with the relative extent of these activities determined by season (Schaller 1967). In a day, peak feeding times are around dawn and dusk. There are usually two major resting periods, before dawn and mid-day (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Considerable further detail on ecology, drawn from the relative wealth of studies on the species, with each item precisely referenced to source, is provided by Raman (2013).","There are presently no major global-level threats to Chital, although densities are widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock. There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000,&#160;Madhusudan and Karanth&#160;2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.<br/><br/>The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.<br/><br/>Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (= <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Chital declined drastically throughout its range up until the first two-thirds of the 20th century (see under Major Threats). Karanth<em> et al. </em>(2010) documented an estimated average extinction rate of 45% over the last 50 years in the Indian sub-continent. It is however ""locally"" abundant in well protected parts of its range in mixes deciduous habitats. In India it occurs in 123 protected areas and forest tracts (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India in Sankar and Acharya 2004). There are some large subpopulations in Nepal (e.g. Moe and Wegge 1994) where the population is probably currently stable and is anticipated to remain so in the immediate future (Hem Sagar Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Thousands survive in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh, and there are a few introducedsub populations on coastal islands in the south (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The reported ecological densities of Chital mostly fall within three to 50 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 4.51 +/- 1.05 (SE) per&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 51.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 49.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 50.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 20.1 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.2 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 38.4 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); BRT mixed deciduous forest, 9.4 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Dandeli-Anshi mix of evergreen and deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Panna dry deciduous forest, 10.2 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Chundawat and Karanth unpublished data); Kawal dry deciduous forset two animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Siddique 2010),&#160;and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some parts of the well-protected areas in Nagarahole and Bandipur are known to harbour densities as high as 80–100 Chital per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2010). Humar (2010) observed high spatial variation in the abundance of Chital in the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Nagarahole-Bandipur National Parks, which ranged between zero to 100 animals per km<sup>2</sup>. Kumar (2010) also found that Chital densities positively responded to higher levels of protection, forage quality, flat terrain and water availability.&#160;The highest population densities, of around 200 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, are reported for the Bardia National Park, Nepal (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994) and for the reintroducedsub population in Guindy National Park, southern India (Menon 1982, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). These high densities reflect habitat and food availability in the former area (Moe and Wegge 1994), and supplementary feeding and low predation in the latter (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Population densities in marginal habitats tend to be lower (Raman 2013; K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Chital is the most abundant ungulate in Nagarahole, and reaches higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and livestock grazing (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site. This found respective densities of 65 and 10 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>The Chital is almost completely dependent on active protection. Were this to be removed, the species' status in the 1970s suggests that rapid declines would occur. Even now, a very large proportion of its range supports subpopulations at significantly lower densities than the habitat could support.<br/><br/>The only subpopulation in Europe is on the islands of Brijuni (off Istria, Croatia), but B. Krystufek (pers. comm. 2008) has traced no information on its current status. Information has not been sought for this account on introduced subpopulations elsewhere, because they do not contribute to assessing the species’ Red List status.",Unknown,"The Chital occurs over 8–30°N in India (including Sikkim), Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). The western distribution boundary is formed by eastern Rajasthan (e.g. Sariska, Ranthambore and Keoladeo Ghana) and Gujarat (e.g. Sasan Gir). The northern boundary runs along the bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan below 1,100 m asl. The eastern boundary runs through western Assam (Golapara and Kamrup district as far east as the Dhunsiri River in Darrang district) to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit (Gee 1964, Schaller 1967, Raman 2013). Chital occur throughout the rest of peninsular India sporadically in the forested areas (Sankar and Acharya 2004), but in Bangladesh, it now occurs only in the Sundarbans, having vanished from the central, northeast and southeast regions (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>Chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands (India, during 1925–1930; Banerji 1955), Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Croatia (islands of Brijuni; Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999), Moldova, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Uruguay and the USA (California, Florida, Hawaiian Islands and Texas; Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). These introduced subpopulations have not been mapped. Not all introductions have succeeded: for example, some were introduced to west-central Slovenia (from the Brijuni islands) in the late 1940s or in 1950, but this introduction failed and is now therefore frequently reported as having been of Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>. One male, shot on 12 October 1950 and now in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, proves the identification (Krystufek 1999). Managed herds occur in parks throughout the native and introduced range and in many other areas.","Chital are hunted for food, sport, and a variety of other purposes. It is unclear as to the numbers of captive animals kept within the native range and even if such animals are used to supply the same markets as wild caught animals. Introduced subpopulations almost certainly do not supply the same markets as wild caught animals from the species native range.",Terrestrial,"Chital is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It occurs in many protected areas. Legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas are the two cornerstones of its current healthy conservation status. Subpopulations exceeding 20,000 Chital probably occur in and around a handful of conservation areas within India: the belt of about 3,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;between Koh river and Haldwani including the Corbett Tiger Reserve; the Gir Protected Area (about 1,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); Kanha Tiger Reserve (about 2,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); and the Nilgiris–Western Ghats sector including Nagarahole, Bandipur, and Mudumalai (about 5,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Raman 2013). Protected areas support more Chitals than do non-protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, although there is not currently such a great difference in densities as with the grassland species (Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em>;<em>&#160;</em>Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Ongoing habitat conversion trends outside protected areas will continue to increase the relative proportion of the total Chital population that they hold, and the maintenance of an extensive network of functional protected areas will remain the foundation of this species’ healthy conservation status. Part of this responsibility is vigilance by staff and partners of illegal poaching, which takes place at varying levels in most of the species range. Some recent cases have involved high-profile public role models, such as actors, poaching Chital and these warrant heavy court penalties. There is a strong case for prevention of livestock grazing in protected areas which hold Chital, partly to reduce risks of disease transmission, but mostly to prevent artificially low densities of Chital being forced through competition (see Threat Section).<br/><br/>Chital subpopulations have been studied in: Corbett (De and Spillit 1966), Kanha (Schaller 1967), Bandipur (Johnsingh 1983, Kumar 2010), Nagarahole (Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Kumar 2010), Sariska (Sankar 1994), Gir (Khan <em>et al</em>. 1995, 1996), Guindy (Raman 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996), Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002), Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003) in India, Chitwan (Seidensticker 1976, Mishra 1982) and Karnali-Bardia (Dinerstein 1980; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997) in Nepal, and Wilpattu (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) in Sri Lanka.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However, subspecies <em>Capreolus capreolus italicus</em> is rare (&lt;10,000 mature individuals) and faces serious threats. <em>C. c. coxi </em>is probably also at risk in the Middle East.","It occupies a wide variety of habitats, including deciduous, mixed or coniferous forests, moorland, pastures, arable land, and suburban areas with large gardens. It prefers landscapes with a mosaic of woodland and farmland (Stubbe 1999) but can survive in semi-desert environments and above the tree line seasonally. Roe Deer are well adapted to modern agricultural landscapes (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1998, Danilkin 1996, Sempéré <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat in Europe is the increased mixing of various genetic pools as a result of translocations. This may be a particular threat to genetically distinct peripheral populations, such as those in northern Portugal, the southern Italian Apennines, and Greece (Randi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). Molecular studies show that Roe Deer in central and southern Europe are mainly admixed (Lorenzini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Randi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), indicating that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic structure of populations. The small isolated populations of <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em> in central and southern Italy (Castelporziano, Rome, and Gargano National Park) are also threatened by poaching and predation by free-ranging dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> (Lorenzini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). The small remnant population in Syria is under severe threat from habitat reduction and human persecution (Masseti 2000). Illegal hunting, poaching, collisions with vehicles mainly in the western Black Sea Region, and predation by dogs, are the main threats to the species in Turkey.","It is widespread and common, and is expanding in many areas. Having almost gone extinct in parts of southern Europe because of habitat loss and over-harvesting in the first half of the last century, its numbers started increasing again 20-40 years ago because of countryside abandonment, improved hunting regimes and reintroductions (Gortázar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Densities in the northern and southern parts of the range tend to be lower than in the central parts of the range. The central European population is estimated to number <em>c. </em>15 million individuals. However, the endemic Italian subspecies <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em>, which is largely restricted to southern Tuscany, probably numbers no more than 10,000 individuals and is at significant risk from hybridization with introduced <em>C. c. capreolus </em>(Lorenzini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Mucci <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), which has a large, expanding population in the Italian peninsula. In addition, a small population of <em>C. c. capreolus</em> has been introduced to and kept in an enclosure in Nebrodi National Park on Sicily (Masseti 2011).<br/><br/>In Turkey, the population is estimated at 6,000-8,000 individuals and has been probably increasing in the Black Sea region for two decades due to rural population declines (H. Ambarli pers. comm.).",Increasing,"The Roe Deer has a large range in the Palaearctic. It is found through most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Cyprus, Corsica, Sardinia, and most of the smaller islands), including western Russia (Stubbe 1999). Outside Europe, it occurs in Turkey, northern Syria, northern Iraq, northern Iran, and the Caucasus (Wilson and Reeder 2005). Along the Black Sea coast and in the northern Aegean region of Turkey, the Mediterranean sub-populations are close to extinction. It is extinct in Israel and Lebanon (Wilson and Reeder 2005) (though a re-introduction programme has started in Israel (M. Masseti pers. comm.).

However potential rates of future population decline in both core populations (see below) may approach thresholds (&gt;80%) sufficient to merit a change in status to Critically Endangered in the near future. Monitoring and collating the extent of habitat loss and loss of populations over the next 5-10 years is required.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are two numerically significant units (defined through threat profile, recent history and short-term prospects, not as populations in any demographically meaningful sense) of wild Eld’s Deer, <em>R. e. thamin</em> in Myanmar and <em>R. e. siamensis</em> of Cambodia, Lao and Viet Nam (of which the overwhelming majority of animals are in Cambodia). Numbers in India are numerically less significant for determining species-level population trends and the semi-captive herds in Hainan (now increasing) are excluded as are introduced Thai subpopulations. Since the 2008 assessment rates of habitat loss and degradation within the species’ preferred lowland deciduous forest in Indochina, which supports the majority of the wild <em>R. e. siamensis</em> population, have accelerated due to expansion of economic and social land concessions into previously remote forested areas in Cambodia’s northern and eastern plains. This is impacting both protected and non-protected forests and no Eld’s Deer subpopulations are thus effectively secure. Given this threat (and the presumed status of the Myanmar subpopulations see below) regular re-assessment of the species’ IUCN categorization is merited. In addition, the Cambodian subpopulations are small (potentially none exceeding 50 mature individuals), functionally isolated, and largely outside the core zones of protected areas. All subpopulations also remain impacted by hunting.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The status of the Myanmar subpopulations is also likely to be declining due to a combination of habitat loss and hunting. Recent (2014) evidence from Myanmar indicates considerable loss of suitable lowland deciduous forest in central Myanmar and a potentially significant decline at one of the countries two core sites (Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary) (W. McShea in litt. 2014). The Manipur subpopulation is stable but its small size (approximately 100 individuals; Hussain<em> et al. </em>2009, M.J Ranjitsinh in litt. 2014) and threatened habitat in a single small protected area leave little cause for long-term optimism.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">For the species to be categorised as Critically Endangered in the future (criteria A), an 80% decline over c. 15 years would be required, which would be likely to entail, assuming a stable Manipur subpopulation, the complete loss of Eld’s Deer populations from the remaining (one or two) sites in Lao PDR, and local extinctions from all but one protected area population in each of Cambodia and Myanmar. This scenario has not occurred, yet is possible but, perhaps, not likely. and therefore we maintain the previous assessment of Endangered. Regular monitoring of both rates of habitat loss and the status of core populations in both Cambodia and Myanmar is of critical importance for this species</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia seems to have occurred in a variety of primarily open, grass dominated habitats. Most evidence of presence comes from Deciduous Dipterocarp Forests which primarily occur in the highly monsoonal areas of the Mekong plains (Wharton 1957, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), but historical populations known from, for instance, the Nakai and Bolaven plateaux of Lao PDR appear to have used a mosaic of small grasslands and wetlands amongst pine, semi-evergreen and other forest types, and those known from the Dalat and Kirirom plateaux would seemingly have occurred in more extensive pine/savanna habitats (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species may also have occurred in northern Lao PDR, where suitable habitat is localised to a few plains amid the generally unsuitable rugged densely forested terrain but no conclusive records have been traced (Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999), and would have presumably inhabited Mixed Deciduous Forests and grasslands of anthropogenic origin, (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Populations in deciduous Dipterocarp Forest appear to favour open-canopy formations, with grass dominated understory, especially areas with extensive grassland patches, and avoid closed-canopy formations where small deciduous bamboos predominate in the understory (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Gray <em>et al. </em>2012, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Given the highly seasonal nature of such forest areas, permanent wetlands, usually in the form of forest pools or stream bed pools, are likely to be very significant to the species and the densities of animals that a given area can support (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008; T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Despite suggestions to the contrary in some sources, there is no evidence that Eld’s Deer in these countries are particularly wetland associated, nor is there evidence that the species reached high densities in floodplain tall grasslands (contrary to the case with hog deer) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The grasslands that the species appears often to associate with are favoured over forest for conversion to rice paddies, and the paddies likewise appear attractive to the deer (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Males appear to be fond of wallowing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that deer do not make substantial movements and tend to remain year round within relatively small areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). At Ang Trapaeng Thmor Conservation Area deer are forced to disperse, during the wet-season, from flooded grassland and agricultural areas around a reservoir where breeding occurs, into adjacent areas of decidious Dipterocarp Forest (S. Mahood pers. comm. 2013). Lekagul and McNeely (1988) suggested that Eld’s Deer had been driven into drier areas by hunting and habitat destruction. However, this is clearly not the case in Cambodia where historically Eld’s Deer were considered one of the most abundant species in the open seasonally very dry forests of the north and east (Wharton 1957). </p>  <p>The Loktak lake population in Manipur, India, inhabits an area of floating marsh called locally ‘phumdi’ (Singh 1983, 2004). This population has adaptations of the feet which are thought to help the animals move easily in their marshland habitat (Pocock 1943), but Pocock (1943) speculated that elsewhere in north-east India Eld’s Deer would also have occupied drier plains.&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Myanmar most Eld’s Deer occur in indaing forest, which is usually dominated by the tree <em>Dipterocarpus tuberculatus</em>, and is structurally and ecologically fairly equivalent to the Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest of Indochina and Thailand. There are two other types of deciduous forests used by the deer in Myanmar, dry (thandahat), and mixed (teak). All three forest types receive 100-200 cm of rainfall a year (Prescott 1987; Bronson 1989; McShea <em>et al. </em>1999, 2001; Myint Aung <em>et al.</em> 2001). Pristine habitat is now absent within the Myanmar range of Eld’s Deer and all populations use habitats at various stages of secondary succession (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The ecology of animals in Myanmar is likely to be similar to those in Indochina and Thailand reflecting the similarities in habitat, with dry-season movement closely correlated with the locations of water sources (Prescott 1987; McShea <em>et al. </em>1999, 2001). At the Hlawga wildlife park just outside Yangon, Myanmar, many species of Myanmar’s native wildlife have been introduced. In contrast to Hog Deer, Sambar and Northern Red Muntjac, which have all increased to good populations, Eld’s Deer has failed to establish itself within this small fenced area. This is attributed by staff, including a past veterinarian, to the area being too humid (it is said to be outside the native range of Eld’s Deer) although this has not been confirmed.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The typical habitat of ‘Eld’s Deer in Hainan Island is scrubland and dry grassland together with sparse trees in hills below 200 m asl in altitude (Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Eld’s Deer feeds on grass and some browse and also take fallen fruits and flowers, and reportedly can live without water for several days. Eld’s Deer regularly visits salt licks. Stags are generally solitary except during the rut, while hinds congregate throughout most of the year (Gee 1961, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1996). Wharton (1957) recorded large herds in Cambodia in the 1950s, and Lekagul and McNeely (1988) stated that, prior to hunting reductions, herds of over 50 formed. In Keibul Lamjao National Park, <em>R. e. eldii </em>is thought to move from the ‘phumdi’ to island hillocks during periods of flooding (Green 1990). In China, the rut is during February-June, with a single fawn born from September to January. In India, calving occurs from mid-October to the end of December. Gestation period is between 237 and 240 days, and sexual maturity is reached at approximately 1.5-2.0 years (Wemmer and Grodinsky 1988).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam the most obvious threat to Eld’s Deer is hunting, which in addition to local consumption of meat is driven by a thriving and probably increasing trade in bushmeat, a national, regional and East Asian market for traditional medicinal products derived from the species, and a regional international market for trophy antlers (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). However since 2010 large-scale habitat loss and conversion of Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest for Economic and Social Land Concessions, which also increased hunting pressure, has become an equally significant threat in Cambodia. In addition the highly fragmented nature and small population size of the remaining subpopulations makes the species’ perhaps vulnerable to small population threats.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The influence of traditional medicinal trade is uncertain, but may be very significant as products derived from the species are reportedly more valuable than are those from other deer (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). Some hunting in Cambodia is probably also driven by a demand for captive animals especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (Salter and Sayer 1986, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer, and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during forest visits, even when the visits are not for hunting (Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Predation of fawns by domestic dogs, which are ubiquitous within dry forests in lowland Indochina, has been identified as a threat to the Savannakhet subpopulation in Lao PDR (P. Vongkhamheng pers. comm. 2013) and may also impact the scattered Cambodian subpopulations particularly those outside the cores of protected areas. The effects of hunting have been exacerbated by forest loss and fragmentation, which is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. Selective logging was initially one of the main driving forces, but it is now of relatively minor concern (Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Human in-migration and subsequent agricultural encroachment into forest areas tends to concentrate on those habitats most used by Eld’s Deer, and thus the species has suffered more than most from hunting (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005). In-migration is also a commonly associated with land concessions in Cambodia. Indeed the loss of considerable (~500 km<sup>2</sup>) Eld’s Deer habitat in Preah Vihear province in 2011-12 was associated with a Social Land Concession given to military families. As an inhabitant of relatively open habitat through which travel and transport are easy, it is also likely to have been more heavily affected by a given level of hunting effort compared with species of rugged, dense hill evergreen forest; a similar scenario has been postulated for Jungle Cat <em>Felis chaus</em> (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Probably the most significant challenge to conserving the species in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam is the uncertainty involved with long-term protected-area based conservation management. No protected areas within Cambodia are safe from conversion to other land-uses. Protected areas, even those that at present have relatively active and effective management, face an uncertain future with the possibility of excision of conservation status largely for land concessions, the lack of long-term security in external funding adequate to maintain high standards of management, fluctuations in political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the consequential difficulties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Protected areas, primarily those along the tri-border area of Thailand where it adjoins both Lao PDR and Cambodia, and the Huai Kha Khaeng WS, were unable to prevent the decline and likely extirpation of Eld’s Deer from the wild in Thailand (see Bhumpakphan<em> et al. </em>2004). This decline was likely to have been driven by much the same reasons as in Indochina. If any Eld’s Deer do remain in the wild there, it seems unlikely that they will ever recover unassisted. There are few data on the introduced populations of <em>R. e. thamin</em> to non-native areas (see Bhumpakphan <em>et al. </em>2004).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Threats to the species in Myanmar appear to be similar to those in Indochina, with perhaps more emphasis on exploitation for meat (Salter and Sayer 1986, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1997). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Habitat loss in some range areas is still ongoing (Myint Aung 2004) and Koy <em>et al. </em>(2005) found that ‘patterns of percentage tree canopy-cover were negatively correlated with human population density, suggesting further threats to Eld's Deer populations as the human population continues to grow’. </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">A support programme for the main site, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, had an encouraging start but following cessation of external funding the population is now in decline (see Population), while other protected areas in the country either failed to include appropriate habitat for the species (e.g. Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park) or failed to protect the habitat even within the protected area (e.g. Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Overall, the challenges of generating functional protected areas which will sustain Eld’s Deer are similar to, and under current conditions even more daunting than, those outlined for Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (above). In general, protected areas in Myanmar are themselves highly threatened by major shortfalls in funding and political will (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2002).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The population on Hainan faces an uncertain future as a wild animal without hands-on management, because protected area management has not been effective in preventing poaching (see Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). Loss of suitable habitat has been extensive and is continuing, but large enough areas probably remain for further population expansion, provided that herds in such situations could be adequately protected from poaching (see Zeng<em> et al.</em> 2005). Genetic analyses of the population suggest that there is low diversity resulting from a population bottleneck, and this could in the future threaten the population’s viability (Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Balakrishnan <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Indian populations of Eld’s Deer declined due to some combination of hunting and habitat loss. Even at the Keibul Lamjao National Park, the habitats of the deer have been encroached for grazing, cultivation, and fish farming (Green 1990), but this seems to be mainly now under control (Singh 2004). This population is now most threatened by a hydro-electric project in Loktak Lake which maintains unnaturally high water levels during the dry season and has changed water flow patterns and water quality in the lake (Singh 2004). These in turn appear to be affecting the ecology of the Keibul Lamjao National Park floating marsh (Singh 2004, Sanjit <em>et al.</em> 2005). Floods could also seriously affect the population, which has no high ground to which it can easily escape (Singh 2004). There may also be the threat of low genetic diversity resulting from the effect of a very small founder population (Balakrishnan <em>et al</em>. 2004) and as a small isolated population it must also be considered at risk from disease transfer from domestic livestock, and potentially other factors.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Eld’s Deer readily grazes on rice and some other agricultural products (McShea and Myint Aung 2001). This provides some potential for human-wildlife conflict, but under current conditions populations seem to be too low for this to be a serious problem (e.g. at the Chonbuly district population, Savannakhet province, Lao PDR; J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Retributory killing may become more of a threat if populations are successfully rebuilt in areas close to agriculture.</p>","Based on both habitat extent and size of remaining patches, Myanmar and Cambodia are the pre-eminent countries for Eld's Deer (McShea <em>et al</em>. 2005). However, the actual status of remaining populations is more related to hunting levels.<br/><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Cambodia declines since the late 1950s, when large herds were still readily seen (Wharton 1957), have been dramatic. In the first decade of the 21st century the species declined by 90% or more, given comparisons of aerial counts in 1994 with ground survey results from 1998 to 2008 (Olivier and Woodford 1994, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Eld’s Deer may still occur over a relatively wide area, although localised within this, surviving as small remnant groups in the lowland forests of the north and east. The 2008 account suggested the total Cambodian population “could well be several thousand animals in a forest area that probably exceeds 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>”. However the current population is more likely &lt;700 individuals in a number of functionally isolated subpopulations despite remaining habitat. As a result of the scattered nature of the small Eld’s Deer subpopulations across northern and eastern Cambodia few occur within the cores of managed protected areas.&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Survey work in appropriate habitat between 1998 and 2008 detected subpopulations in at least 15 separate areas, with anecdotal evidence from several more areas (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2006, Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al.</em> in press). A few may remain in the southwest, although there is little evidence other than for one small subpopulation in the Phnom Aural area which persisted until at least the late 1990s (Henshaw<em> et al.</em> 2002, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005), but there is no more recent information. Gray <em>et al. </em>(2012) reviewed camera-trap data from eastern Cambodia between 1999 and 2007 and documented Eld’s Deer records from five of nine survey sites. However in three of these (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, areas of Seima Protected Forest and adjacent Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary and unprotected forest close to Prey Khieu at the Mondulkiri-Stung Treng provincial border) recent (post-2008) and extensive habitat loss is likely to have resulted in subpopulation extirpation.</span></p><p>Recent robust distance-based line transect surveys in a number of protected areas which support, or supported, the species (Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Seima Protection Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary) failed to detect sufficient Eld’s Deer for population estimation c.f. another globally threatened large ungulate in the landscape banteng Bos javancius (O’Kelly <em>et al. </em>2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, S. Mahood pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Only the subpopulations in Mondulkiri Protected Forest (~50-75 individuals) and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary/Preah Vihear Protected Forest (probably a similar size to that in Mondulkiri Protected Forest) are likely resident year-round within a relatively well-patrolled and secured protected area. Numbers in western Siem Pang, Stung Treng province may be higher than previously suspected (BirdLife International Cambodia 2012) but the subpopulation, of between 50-150 individuals, occurs at a site directly threatened through ongoing conversion to Economic Land Concessions. At Ang Trapaeng Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area, Banteay Meanchey province, the subpopulation of 30-50 individuals disperses out of the protected area into community forestry during the wet-season (S. Mahood pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US""><em>R. e. thamin</em> was still relatively widespread and abundant during the mid-1980s on the plains of central and northern Myanmar, where its range centred on the Irrawaddy Plain, including the Bago or Sittang Plain to the east. It was said to be present to the southeast, along the Thai border (Salter and Sayer 1986), and along the western border with Bangladesh (Lekagul and McNeely 1977), but these records are doubtful and a questionnaire in 1992 and surveys in 1997 could only find evidence for the species in the northeast (McShea<em> et al.</em> 2000). In 1992 a countrywide questionnaire was distributed by the then Wildlife Department of Myanmar, this resulted in reports of Eld’s Deer from 28 Myanmar townships, and 2,200 Eld’s Deer were estimated to remain within Myanmar, with the largest population (over 1,200 deer) in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (Myint Aung 1994, McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000). Regular transect surveys in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary between 1983 and 1996 indicated a population decline of upwards of 40% (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000), with a population estimated at about 500 deer in the latter years (Myint Aung pers. comm. 1996). More recent evidence indicates a continued decline at this site and the population is likely now to be considerably below 100 individuals (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">A nationwide survey of Myanmar in 1997 found evidence of Eld’s Deer within 23 of 24 townships surveyed, out of the 28 that were reported to contain Eld’s Deer in 1992. The four un-surveyed townships were considered very unlikely to still harbour deer because of the little remaining habitat within them (McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000). By 2003 a repeat of the 1992 surveys concluded that deer had disappeared from four townships and had declined in at least another four, but there were signs that in some townships populations were stable or even increasing (Myint Aung 2004). However, surveys in 2007 found Eld’s Deer in only 14 townships and had therefore seriously declined. Increases and decreases were in part put down to reforestation efforts and habitat loss respectively (Myint Aung 2004). More recent, anecdotal, assessment of habitat quality indicates considerable loss of lowland deciduous forest throughout central Myanmar in the last 10 years (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014). At Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, favourable habitat has been taken over by agriculture however more recent information suggests that the site may now hold the most significant Eld’s Deer population in the country with at least 200 individuals noted in 2004 (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary was described in the 2008 assessment as “now the only viable population with nominal protection, and habitat currently appears more secure” however the assessors ominously noted that “protection efforts appear to be failing, at least partly reflecting changes in management. Since funding from the Smithsonian Institution ceased in 2003, the amount of patrolling and the Eld’s Deer population have decreased every year (W. McShea pers. comm. 2008); a causal link seems inescapable”. More recent, ad-hoc, observations support this conclusion and it is likely that Eld’s Deer populations in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary have declined &gt;50% in the past 10 years.&#160;</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Two populations detected on the outskirts of Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park and Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary were&#160; never protected by inclusion in the&#160; parks, and elsewhere in the country other populations and large blocks of suitable habitat have not been gazetted into the protected area system despite hopes that they would be (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000, W. McShea pers. comm. 2008).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Lao PDR there are one or two known populations. One (of probably under 50 animals) is in Savannakhet province (central Lao PDR) and has been the focus of a community led species-specific conservation project, with regular subjective monitoring of the population (Johnson <em>et al. </em>2004, A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). However this monitoring is not able to effectively estimate population size or trends.. In the late 1990s another small subpopulation, of probably the low dozens of animals, was found from Champasak Province, far south-western Lao PDR, in areas adjacent to the Dong Khanthung Provincial Protected Area, but there has been no recent re-evaluation of the site and it is quite plausible that the species has been hunted out there (Round 1998, Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999, A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely, given the distribution of suitable habitat, the distribution of the human population, and the pervasive hunting culture in Lao PDR that any more significant populations of the species remain to be found (R.J. Timmins pers. obs.); lowland Savannakhet province was the only unprotected part of Lao PDR where in Duckworth <em>et al</em>. (1999: 41) recommended additional surveys of large mammals as likely to reveal new conservation priorities. One subpopulation was indeed found but since that was written, options for others have greatly declined due to extensive road-building, conversion of remaining dry forest habitat and assignment of much of the rest to plantation concessions (particularly on the western plains of the province) and continued extremely high levels of trade-driven large mammal hunting make the chances of any others remaining now very low (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008 from field assessment in late 2007).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Survival in Viet Nam is now very doubtful. Eld’s Deer was still reported by local inhabitants in the early 2000’s (e.g. as reported in Nguyen Xuan Dang and Nguyen Thi Thuy (2004), but field surveys of such areas have failed to find the species (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006). Perhaps a few animals remain along the border with Cambodia (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006), but repeated recent surveys of one of the more promising areas, Yok Don National Park, has not produced good evidence (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997, Eames<em> et al.</em> 2004). The reported distributions given by Dang Huy Huynh (1990) and Ratajszczak (1991) were either overly optimistic and based on unverified evidence, or indicate a recent swift decline in the species in Viet Nam; probably both factors are responsible.</p>  <p>Continued presence of ancestral wild populations in Thailand is also now very unlikely. At best a few remnant individuals may survive or immigrate. The Thai Royal Forestry Department has a captive breeding programme for both <em>R. e. thamin</em> and <em>R. e. eldii</em> and there have been attempts at introduction of the former in two areas (where it was never a native subspecies); numbers living in a ‘wild state’ are in the low tens (Naris Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Although once distributed in the tropical zone of southwest Yunnan and further east, the South China Eld’s Deer has long been extirpated (Smith and Xie 2008<span lang=""EN-US"">, Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). By the 1970s the only remaining Chinese populations were on Hainan and had declined to some 40 animals in Dong Fang and Bai Sha Counties, primarily due to poaching, from a reported 500 individuals in 1950s (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 1976 two protected areas, the Datian Nature Reserve, and the Bangxi NR, West Hainan, were founded around the two last remaining isolated herds of deer, with 26 and 20 animals respectively (Song and Zeng 2004, Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). By 1981 the Bangxi NR population had been exterminated by poaching (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). The animals in Datian NR were kept in fenced enclosures while the population grew, and at the current time the whole c. 13 km<sup>2</sup> of the reserve is enclosed (Song 1996, Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). Initial problems with conservation efforts at Datian included encroachment of almost half its habitat by agriculture since its establishment, deer deaths through drought and overcrowding in small enclosures, and some poaching (Pang <em>et al. </em>2003, Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). By 1991 the Chinese population had rebounded to 346 animals, of which 261 were within the Datian Nature Reserve (Yuan <em>et al. </em>1993). By 2003 there were about 1,000 animals in Datian NR, and beginning in 1986 captive and semi-wild populations were established at other facilities, the total population in which was approximately 260 animals in 2003 (Song and Zeng 2004, Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). A semi-wild herd was founded once again in Bangxi NR, and by 2002 the population there was reportedly 115 animals (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). In 2003 a third ‘wild’ herd was founded in Mihouling Reserve (Song and Zeng 2004, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, <em>R. e. eldii </em>was thought to be extinct in the early 1950s but was subsequently rediscovered. By 1975, the only remaining wild population had declined to about 14 animals in the swamps of Loktak Lake, Manipur (Ranjitsinh 1978). On this basis, a floating marsh on the southern end of Loktak Lake was gazetted in 1977 as the Keibul Lamjao National Park (Ranjitsinh 1978). During 2006-2008, Eld’s Deer presence was recorded in a 21.5 - 22.7 km<sup>2</sup> area of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. Higher dung density was recorded from &gt;9.0 ± 0.18&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;area of the Park. The point count method used for population monitoring revealed the estimated density of 4.04, 4.08 and 4.05 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;during 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, with a minimum of 2.97 individual per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and maximum of 6.01 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at 95% confidence level. This yields the estimated mean population size as 91, 88 and 92 individuals during 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, with a minimum of 60 and maximum of 136 Sangai at 95% confidence level. This indicates that the population of Sangai in the Park is more or less stable (Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;</span></p>",Decreasing,"This species was formerly widely distributed across suitable habitats of South and Southeast Asia, from the Manipur region of northeastern India through much of Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam to the island of Hainan (China) in the east (Salter and Sayer 1986, Grubb 2005). The historical range was broken into four major components, consisting of the Manipur region of India inhabited by <em>R. e. eldii</em>; <em>R. e. thamin</em> on the central plains of Myanmar; <em>R. e. siamensis</em> populations in the lowlands of Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (separated by the mountains along the Thai-Myanmar border from <em>R. e. thamin</em>); and the population on Hainan and former populations in mainland southern China, which appear to have been disjunct outliers of <em>R. e. siamensis</em>, separated from its main range by mountainous terrain in Lao PDR and Viet Nam.<br/><br/>The global Eld's Deer population is currently very localized to small areas within the species' former range. <em>R. e. eldii</em> is now confined to a single small population at the southern end of Loktak Lake in Manipur, India (Singh 2004). <em>R. e. thamin</em> still occurs in several localised areas of central Myanmar, as well as there being introduced populations in Thailand (McShea <em>et al</em>. 2000, Aung 2004, Naris Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. 2004). <em>R. e. siamensis</em> occurs in one or two small localised populations in Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2004), and as scattered small subpopulations mainly in the northern and eastern lowlands of Cambodia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005), and occurs in a relatively wild state in one protected area on Hainan, with additionally several other managed herds on that island (Pang <em>et al</em>. 2003).","Eld's Deer is hunted for food and other purposes. There are many captive animals, the uses of these other than for breeding stock are unknown.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. Although most Cambodian Eld’s Deer are within protected areas few occur within government approved Core Zones (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, McShea<em> et al.</em> 2005, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005, Timmins 2006). The recent loss, or substantial decline of subpopulations in, and around, Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich and Snoul Wildlife Sanctuaries, and O’Yadao Protected Forest due to conversion to land concessions largely occurred because these subpopulations were on the edge of protected areas, close to villages, and in areas where conversion to other land-uses was difficult to prevent.Conservation management of the Kulen Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protection Forest, and, particularly, Ang Trapaeng Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area and Mondulkiri Protected Forest may be stabilising and perhaps even increasing Eld’s Deer populations, through externally funded conservation management projects supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society and The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF unpublished data, WCS unpublished data, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013, S. Mahood pers. comm. 2013). However evidence of increasing Eld’s Deer populations does not exist and recent intensive line-transects surveys have not detected sufficient individuals for robust population size estimation. These five areas cover well over 3,000 km<sup>2</sup> of relatively suitable Eld’s Deer habitat, and thus the most pressing conservation need is the continued support and consolidation of these protected areas. Only once this is in place would it be sensible to divert resources to protect Eld’s Deer in further areas of Cambodia currently with little to no active protection. However the intensities of law enforcement within these sites is highly variable and dependent upon both external non-governmental financial and technical support and political buy-in from governments. For example the temporary removal of provincial police from supporting patrolling activities in Mondulkiri Protected Forest in 2011 by provincial authorities resulted in at least one documented Eld’s Deer poaching event and a considerable influx of general illegal activity across the protected area.  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">An additional conservation action within the core zone of Mondulkiri Protected Forest is the artificial deepening of natural waterholes (trapaeng in Khmer) to ensure year-round water availability, which is also planned for Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary (S. Mahood pers. comm.). Research has indicated the majority of trapaeng are dry in the height of the dry-season and trapaeng deepening has been demonstrated to maintain enhance water retention and provide dry-season water access to Eld’s Deer and other threatened species (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014 and unpublished manuscript).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The central Lao population in Chonbuly District, Savannakhet Province, is under nominal protection in a roughly 200 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;provincial protected area specifically designated for the species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004). The area had an ongoing conservation management project supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004) which since 2009 has been resumed by WWF with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The single southern Lao population found during extensive surveys in the 1990s was small and inhabited a mosaic of farmland amidst forest, adjacent to a subsequently declared provincial protected area (Round 1998). Attempts to upgrade the provincial protected area to national status have failed (A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007)..</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Thailand the protected area system failed to prevent the species' effective national extinction some years ago. Therefore, recent conservation efforts there have focused on the captive breeding of large numbers of <em>R. e. thamin</em> (see Bhumpakphan <em>et al.</em> 2004), which is not, however, native to most of Thailand. Attempts to introduce <em>R. e. thamin</em> to non-native areas have had limited success, although there is a residual herd at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station (Bhumpakphan<em> et al. </em>2004). Forty-five individuals were reintroduced into Huai Kha Khaeng WS and approximately 20 deer to Wang Lor Wildlife Sanctuary but then the programme was discontinued (W. McShea pers. comm. 2014). <em>R. e. siamensis</em> was the subject of an abortive Smithsonian Institution reintroduction program initiated in 1985. By 1989, progress was limited to construction of holding facilities at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station. As with other range states the most pressing conservation measures seem to be strengthening protected area management in those areas that cover the species' former range, so that reintroduction might be possible in the future, jointly with measures to align all stakeholders to ensure that introduction programmes do not create herds with a mix of <em>R. e. siamensis</em> and <em>R. e. thamin</em> ancestry.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Hainan population is now highly managed with most of the population in Datian NR, and other animals in Bangxi NR and Mihouling Reserve, and other captive facilities (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has been the subject of various avenues of research, for instance a population viability analysis was undertaken to examine demographic and environmental (drought) challenges to the two enclosed populations at the Hainan Datian Nature Reserve (Song 1996), with other research by Yuan <em>et al</em>. (1993) and Song (1993) (see also Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). But, the most important conservation measure needed appears to be strengthening of the protected area system so that deer can be re-established in a wild state without danger of poaching or habitat encroachment (see Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">India held 97 captive animals in 15 zoos in December 1992, a slight decline from over 100 in the mid-1980s (Decoux 1993); by 1994, 14 zoos held 107 animals (Sharma 1994). The population is probably inbred: all reportedly are descended from two founder pairs (Walker and Marimuthu 1991, see also Balakrishnan <em>et al. </em>2003). The 40&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;Keibul Lamjao National Park was gazetted in 1977 specifically to protect <em>R. e. eldii</em> (Ranjitsinh 1978). Subsequently projects at the park have raised public awareness, and local support has been developed for conserving the endemic Manipur subspecies, and largely halted encroachment of the species habitat (Singh 2004). Status surveys of <em>R. e. eldii </em>have been carried out annually in Keibul Lamjao National Park since 1975 (Ranjitsinh 1996, Singh 2004), and research has been undertaken by Singh (1983, 2004). A Wildlife Institute of India proposal in the 1980s to establish a second free-ranging population in Assam (Khan <em>et al.</em> 1993) was not implemented. Conservation needs are essentially mitigating detrimental effects of the hydropower project on the park, strengthening the protected area management of the park (e.g. through even further improvement of local relations and capacity building), increasing the park’s area to meet the needs of deer through appropriate research and potentially establishing further wild populations in other areas.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Myanmar, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary were established specifically to protect <em>R. e. thamin</em> (Salter and Sayer 1986), but little management has been undertaken and despite promising initial efforts, management effectiveness appears to be decreasing (Myint Aung 1990, W.J. McShea pers. comm. 2008). Deer were found on the outskirts of two other protected areas&#160; Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park and Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary, but protection efforts were never extended to cover the appropriate area, and the majority of the remnant area occupied by the species are likely to be outside protected areas (McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000, W. McShea pers. comm. 2008). A number of reintroductions have taken place into enclosed sites such as Hlawga Wildlife Park, using animals from Rangoon Zoo and the wild. In 1995, an ecological study of radio-collared <em>R. e. thamin</em> was initiated in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary by the Smithsonian Institution, and a community education project commenced later that year to raise local awareness of the deer and the wildlife sanctuary (Wemmer 1995). The Wildlife Division surveys the population annually using a basic line transect method. Conservation measures needed were recently assessed to include extending the protected areas network (McShea<em> et al.</em> 2000) but in the interim the most pressing needs seem to be to prevent further deterioration at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and to salvage the Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, if this is possible.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">McShea <em>et al.</em> (2005) argued that ""only Cambodia, with 11% suitable forest protected, has placed sufficient dry dipterocarp forest under protected status. Other Southeast Asia countries have not recognized dry dipterocarp forest as a significant ecotype worthy of conservation status"". It is certainly true that this forest type has been seen as a low priority in the conservation planning of all range states, but consideration that a country has placed 'sufficient' of any habitat type under protected status is subjective and a variety of measures can be used. In this case, 'sufficiency' was judged on the basis of proportion of a country's total suitable habitat that has been nominally protected. An alternative would be to consider factors like the actual amount of protected habitat, and whether this is enough to represent the range of biotic variation within the country; whether such habitat is in large enough blocks to remain ecologically functional into the long term, and whether protection is largely nominal or is genuinely effective. The last dichotomy is likely to be the chief determinant of whether Eld's deer will survive. Considering that no range states yet have existing protected areas which have secured the species on a long-term footing (although there are promising developments in several countries), and considering the speed with which populations can decrease, priority is necessary at present to concentrate most conservation actions for Eld’s Deer on securing existing protected areas for key populations which have real potential for success. This has become increasingly urgent given the accelerating threats to lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest in Cambodia both outside, and within, protected areas. Determining this potential will reflect situational factors as much or more than ‘traditional’ biological factors such as current Eld’s Deer status within them. Eld’s Deer could potentially persist in habitat mosaics of forest and agriculture, as they still do in some areas of Myanmar and Cambodia (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000, T. D. Evans pers. comm. 2007), but cultural predisposition to hunting and competing land uses make it unlikely that poaching can be controlled, or habitat management developed, without the context of a protected area, in most range countries (India and perhaps Myanmar being the most likely exceptions).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are large captive populations of the species, estimated in 2003 to number 180 <em>R. e. eldii</em>, 1,100 <em>R. e. thamin</em>, 23 <em>R. e. siamensis</em> (non-Hainan stock) and 280 <em>R. e. siamensis</em> (Hainan stock), but most captive groups are not managed with conservation in mind (Siriaroonrat 2004). There is some scope for using these animals in reintroduction programmes, particularly in Thailand where Eld’s Deer is nationally extinct yet the country is now probably in ‘the best financial and administrative position’ of all range states to conserve landscape-scale field populations of the species (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Some subpopulations or subspecies are now severely threatened. Removal of animals from the wild for commercial purposes and the establishment of deer farms near protected areas (consisting of this species and introduced/foreign species) are a potential threat through the spread of disease and hybridization. Because of its small population size, the Mindoro subspecies (<em>R. m. barandana</em>) is highly threatened, due to the same causes (with intense habitat loss, as over 90% of forest cover has gone on the island)<span lang=""EN-US"">; poaching from lowlander Tagalog Mindorenos and hunting pressure from indigenous people might have become the main threat to this subspecies (E. Schutz pers. comm 2014).","Populations of this species are fragmented, but are reported to be locally common in isolated areas, but heavily hunted and declining throughout most of its range (Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1994). The largest populations are located on Luzon, Mindanao, Samar, and Leyte (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991). Local extinctions have been reported on Biliran (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1991, Rickart <em>et al</em>. 1993), and probably Bohol and Marinduque (W. Oliver pers. comm.). Population declines have been reported in the subspecies <em>R. m. barandana</em>, which has the most restricted range on Mindoro, and which island has been severely deforested, especially in lowland areas (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991). The overall population of the species remains unknown, but a decline of 30% over three generations (estimated at 24 years) seems plausible.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Philippines, and occurs through most of the country except the Negros-Panay Faunal Region, the Babuyan/Batanes groups, the Palawan Faunal Region, the Sulu Faunal Region, and other isolated islets (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1992). It has been recorded on Luzon, Polillo and Catanduanes; Mindoro; Samar, Leyte, Biliran (where it is now extinct; Rickart <em>et al</em>. 1993), Bohol (where it is possibly extinct; Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1992), Mindanao and Basilan Islands, and Marinduque (where it might also be extinct; W. Oliver pers. comm.), but is apparently absent from both Dinagat and Siargao Islands (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998, Grubb 2005). It has a highly fragmented distribution on most of the islands on which it survives, and was undoubtedly more extensively distributed in the past.<br/><br/>Populations have been introduced on Guam, Mariana and Caroline islands in the western Pacific (Grubb 2005). The species was introduced onto the Ogasawara (= Bonin) Islands (Japan) in late 18<sup>th</sup> to early 19<sup>th</sup> centuries by Spanish ships, but went extinct there by about 1925; the species was introduced there again from Guam after World War II, but does not currently occur there (Miura and Yoshihara 2002, Grubb 2005).","It is intensively hunted throughout its range for meat, hides, trophies, and trade, and live animals are also captured for deer farms.",Terrestrial,"Enforcement of existing regulations and protected area management is inadequate and requires strengthening. Some subpopulations or subspecies are severely threatened and may need to be considered individually for management purposes. Captive breeding of this species was advocated by the Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau (ERDB) as a means of supporting rural communities. A large herd mixed with domestic stock is maintained on a ranch in Batangas, medium-sized deer farms (30–40 animals) exist in the Bicol region, and small backyard farms (3–5 animals) are found on Luzon. However, it is most unlikely that these initiatives might ever mitigate threats to any wild populations, as originally supposed, partly because of the increased demand for wild-caught founder breeding stocks, but also (and perhaps more importantly) it is virtually inconceivable that the commensurate establishment of legal markets in locally produced venison would not be widely abused for the continued sale of illegally-caught specimens; especially given the ineffective enforcement of existing protective legislation pertaining to these and other commercially valuable species.<br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions include:<br/><ul><li>Conduct surveys of Philippine deer populations on all major islands to determine their relative abundance, and the nature and extent of threats, and efficacy of any existing protective measures.</li><li>(Re-)investigate the systematic relationships of these animals from and within all major islands, especially within the ‘Greater Mindanao Faunal Region’, and secure comparative specimens from currently undescribed populations on Samar, Leyte and other smaller islands.</li><li>Identify most ‘at risk’ populations based on the aforementioned surveys and systematic studies, and formulate and implement consensual recommendations for the enhanced future protection (and/or recovery) of the most threatened populations/taxa; any such recommendations to also include: the development of new ‘protected areas’ (and/or enhanced protection and management of existing protected areas) where existing habitat and species’ protection measures are clearly inadequate at present; and the re-evaluation and amendment of the evident existing anomalies between permissible subsistence hunting of non-threatened species by indigenous people <em>versus</em> contrary and more recent amendments to the threatened status rankings of traditionally targeted species/subspecies, and/or genuine subsistence hunting <em>versus</em> recreational (and/or commercial) hunting by local community hunters who are no longer economically dependent on such resources.&#160;</li><li>Conduct a field investigation of species in an undisturbed population, preferably within a protected area.</li><li>Re-examine the whole precepts of local deer farming initiatives in the Philippines, and the extent to which they help or hinder conservation.</li></ul>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22168782,4273,Rusa alfredi,Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2016-03-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Rusa alfredi</em> is listed as Endangered because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, there is an estimated continuing decline in the number of mature individuals, and no subpopulation is likely to contain more than 250 mature individuals. Its area of occupancy, based on maximal extent of plausibly occupied habitat, as shown in this account's map, is estimated to be <em>circa</em> 1,100 km².<br/><br/><em>Rusa alfredi </em>density is not known but given that this species is still extensively hunted throughout its range, it is plausible that it is at very low densities, perhaps comparable to those of Sambar (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>)<em> </em>in heavily hunted parts of its range. Sambar density in Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, Thailand, a relatively well protected area that retains a breeding population of Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>)<em> </em>and wild Water Buffalo (<em>Bubalus arnee</em>)<em> </em>is about 2 to 3 individuals km². In Taman Nagara National Park, Malaysia, hunting has reduced the density of Sambar to &lt;1 animal per km². In India density ranges from 1 to 10 animals per km² depending on the level of protection from hunting. In other parts of its range Sambar density is simply too low to permit estimation (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2015). Assuming then that the situation for <em>Rusa alfredi </em>is more similar to Sambar in Malaysia and to areas receiving little protection in India, than to Huai Kha Khaeng in Thailand, an estimated density of &lt;1 animal per km² seems likely. This would give a population of about 1,100 animals and assuming that about two-thirds of the pre-breeding population are mature individuals, this would suggest a population of approximately 700 mature individuals. <br/><br/>Given that the species remains under intense hunting pressure and habitat loss is ongoing, the population decline is most likely to be continuing and the disjunct nature of the surviving distribution means that there are highly likely to be fewer than 250 mature individuals in each subpopulation, thus meeting the criteria for Endangered C2a(i). This species' assessment should be updated as new information on its population status becomes available.","This deer formerly occurred from sea-level to at least 2,000 m asl in primary and secondary growth forest. It can persist in some degraded habitats such as cogon grasslands as long as there are areas of dense cover. Its preferred habitat is not clear, since it is now restricted to steep, rugged slopes of dipterocarp forest that are inaccessible to humans (Cox 1987). It was known to rely on dense forest for refuge (Rabor 1977), but also frequents open grassy patches and secondary communities. Rabor (1977) reports that the main constituents of its diet are young shoots of cogon grass (found in clearings) and young low-growing leaves and buds within forests. It is predominantly a browser, but also a grazer (captive animals also relish fruit). It also visits burnt forest clearings for the pioneering shoots that grow there. All local reports indicate an average group size of one to three individuals—mostly solitary males and females with single young—though it remains unclear whether or not these small group sizes are a function of continued and sustained hunting pressure, particularly as much larger numbers of individuals have been maintained peacefully together in captivity for indefinite periods (W. Oliver, pers. obs). The species breeds year round in captivity and young animals are reported to be captured in the wild at all times of the year.","This species has declined primarily as a result of habitat conversion (agriculture and logging) and hunting (Cox 1987, Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991, Oliver 1992). Despite being fully protected by law, it is still intensively hunted throughout its remaining range; both by local farmers in hinterland communities and recreational hunters from larger cities; both of these groups use the species as game (for meat and trophies), rather than for subsistence purposes (Cox 1987, Evans <em>et al</em>. 1993, Oliver 1994, Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1992). Both of these groups may also sell any surplus meat as venison in local markets or to speciality restaurants; whereas local hunters from upland communities also specialize in live-captures to meet strong demand for these animals as pets (particularly amongst local politicians). Many of these are supplied by the orphans of hunter-killed animals, though almost all such captive stocks also include animals captured as adults in leg snares, as evidenced by the amputation of their lower limbs.<br/><br/>There is continuing severe habitat fragmentation and reduction of populations from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, and some populations are now so reduced in size as to be of doubtful viability. Hybridization with <em>R. mariannus</em> has been repeatedly observed amongst poorly (i.e., unscientifically) managed captive stocks of these two species, but (and despite previously published fears to the contrary) is most unlikely to pose any additional threats to the few surviving populations of <em>R. alfredi</em> given the evident allopatry in the natural ranges of these two species (Cox 1987; Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991; Oliver 1993, 1996).","The species is considered to be rare throughout its present, limited range. Populations are fragmented and declining, although evidently the species is able to use a wide variety of habitats. Currently, the species is estimated to have been extirpated from 95% to 98% of its former range (Oliver <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1991, 1996). There is no global estimate of the population size, but it is reasonable to suppose that it is fewer than 2,500 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Recent biological surveys of southern Negros suggest that the species is  far less numerous than is the Visayan Warty Pig (<em>Sus cebifrons</em>) (N.  Maddison pers. comm. 2016). Sambar density in Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, Thailand, a relatively well protected area that retains a breeding population of Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and wild Water Buffalo (<em>Bubalus arnee</em>) is about 2 to 3 individuals km². In Taman Nagara National Park, Malaysia, hunting has reduced the density of Sambar to &lt;1 animal per km². In India density ranges from 1 to 10 animals per km² depending on the level of protection from hunting. In other parts of its range Sambar density is simply too low to permit estimation (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Assuming then that the situation for <em>Rusa alfredi</em> is more similar to Sambar in Malaysia and to areas receiving little protection in India, than to Huai Kha Khaeng in Thailand, an estimated density of &lt;1 animal per km² seems likely. This would give a population of about 1,100 animals, and assuming that about two-thirds of the pre-breeding population are mature individuals, this would suggest a population size of approximately 700 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Western Visayan Islands (or Negros–Panay Faunal Region) of the central Philippines. Previously the species was found on Panay, Guimaras, Negros, Cebu, Masbate and probably Ticao Islands (Heaney <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998; Grubb 2005; Oliver 1993, 1996). Presently, the species is restricted to the Mount Madja - Mount Baloy area of west Panay and a few scattered remnants of forest on Negros (Cox 1987, Oliver <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1992). It was extirpated on Cebu in the mid-twentieth century. A few individuals were reported to survive on Masbate between 1991 and 1993, but the population there is almost certainly extinct or ‘functionally extinct’. This species is replaced by <em>Rusa mariannus</em> on Bohol and all other larger Philippine Islands east of Huxley’s Line (i.e., excluding Palawan) (Grubb 2005; Oliver 1993, 1996).","It is hunted for food (for both local subsistence and national commercial use) and trophies, and animals are sometimes taken as pets.",Terrestrial,"This species is fully protected under Philippine law, but effective enforcement is lacking in most areas. A number of new protected areas has been established within the range of the species, but management and enforcement likewise remain ineffective in most (perhaps all) such areas. Awareness levels have increased greatly; unfortunately, this has not yet led to a change in behaviour in terms of hunting pressure. The species occurs in small populations in several protected areas: Mount Canlaon National Park (8,000 ha); North Negros Forest Reserve (<em>ca</em> 18,000 ha); Mount Talinis/Lake Balinsasayao Reserve (<em>ca</em> 11,000 ha); and the proposed West Panay Mountains National Park (<em>ca</em> 70,000 ha). However, the formal declaration of the latter area eventually due to lack of unanimity amongst relevant local government units and a number of separate, smaller areas have since been declared, though these do not cover all of the most important sites, nor have any of these areas been significantly better protected since declaration owing the absence of any corresponding national budgetary allocations. Small numbers of individuals are also reported to survive in Hinoba-an in southwestern Negros Oriental, though there is now very little forest remaining in this area.<br/><br/>The Philippine Spotted Deer Conservation Programme (PSDCP) was formally established in April in 1990 under the auspices of a new Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR, Government of the Philippines) and the Parc Zoologique et Botanique de la Ville Mulhouse (Mulhouse Zoo, France), to enable development of a properly structured conservation breeding programme (viz: the ‘World Herd’ of captive <em>R. alfredi</em>) based on the accession of donated and confiscated individuals, previously illegally held as pets by private owners, and to initiate a variety of other related, highest conservation priority activities. These included: development of three local wildlife rescue and breeding centres (two on Negros, one on Panay); wide-ranging field surveys and other field studies; assistance in the establishment of new protected areas and related habitat restoration measures; distribution-wide public awareness campaigns; and diverse personnel training and other local capacity-building initiatives. This programme has since constituted easily the most successful programme of its kind in the Philippines but, and more importantly, it was also established and managed as a ‘flagship’ species/programme for the ‘West Visayas (or ‘Negros–Panay’) Faunal Region’; one of the world’s highest conservation priority areas in terms of both numbers of threatened endemic taxa and degrees of threat. As such the PSCDP has also constituted the principal driving force behind a diverse range of related conservation activities principally focused on a number of other most threatened West Visayan endemic species and species-groups. As of 31 December 2013, there were 29 (12 male,17 female) animals in the Negros captive breeding programme and 138 animals (57 male, 81 female)in captivity overall, including 27 institutions in Europe (Schubert and Heckel 2013), and efforts are currently underway to conduct the first species reintroduction projects in the Philippines, and to do this by means of enabling the development of additional protected areas and/or the far more effective protection and restoration of selected existing protected areas (Oliver 1996, Oliver <em>et al.</em> 2003, Lorica and Oliver 2007).<br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions include:<br/><ul><li>Enhance management and protection of existing protected areas, most of which are effectively ‘unmanaged’ and ‘unprotected’ at present, receiving no national budgetary resource allocations.

They are the only sirenians restricted to freshwater systems.&#160;<em>T. inunguis</em>&#160;occurs in waters with temperatures above 23<sup>o</sup>C (Gallivan <em>et al.</em> 1983), living in the three types of water in Amazonian rivers (white, black and clear), being more abundant in white waters, where there is greater primary production (Best 1984, Rosas 1994).</p><p>Individuals engage in long seasonal movements, moving from flooded areas during the wet season to deep water bodies during the dry season (Arraut <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kendall <em>et al.</em> 2014). While the whitewater rivers (murky water) provide them with plentiful food, deep lakes function as refuges during the low-water season, where animals are less vulnerable to hunting.</p><p>Only one calf is produced at a time. Although no specific studies are available for the species in the wild, it is believed that the reproductive cycle is similar to the West Indian Manatee’s, with a long gestation and lactation period (up to 24 months), and a birthing interval of 2 to 3 years (Best 1983); age at sexual maturity is suggested to be between 6 and 10 years (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Generation length is 25 years, based on what is known for <em>T. manatus.</em></p>","<p>The commercial large scale capture of Amazonian Manatee was the main reason for the reduction of the populations of the species. The main current threats for Manatees are hunting for meat consumption (Denkinger 2010, Brice <em>et al.</em> 2011, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sandoval 2015), entanglement in fishing nets and habitat alterations.</p>  <p><em>Illegal hunting</em>, for both subsistence and local use, is considered the main threat to Manatees in the Amazon. Manatee populations have supported a tremendous take in past centuries and, although not at commercial levels, hunting still takes place throughout the region (Barbosa <em>et al. </em>2010a, b; Franzini <em>et al. </em>2013; Silva <em>et al. </em>2014; M. Marmontel pers. obs). Most hunting is practiced with the use of traditional harpoons, but in Ecuador Manatees may be caught in traps set for <em>Arapaima</em> (Hidalgo 2010).</p>  <p>Hunters usually sell products to neighbors and nearby communities, but the meat is sometimes sold in local produce fairs or markets in the interior, or by order directly with the hunter. Public markets in Brazil (Manaus, Manacapuru, Beruri, Novo Airão, Tefé, Silves, Itapiranga, Itacoatiara, Santarém, Belém, Monte Alegre and Almeirim, Benjamin Constant, Atalaia do Norte) and Ecuador also illegally offer the meat for sale. Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place. Between 2002 and 2004, 64 Manatees were estimated to have been killed in the Amanã-Castanho area (3,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Amanã SDR (Calvimontes 2009), most of them adult males. Between 2011 and 2015, the hunt count for the same area was 42 Manatees. Some 195 Manatees were estimated to have been killed between 2011 and 2015 in the Uatumã River valley (Brazil) through the expeditions of Project Protecting Life in Uatumã (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016). In the Urucu region of Brazil 20 Manatees were captured between 2004 and 2007, 14 harpooned and 6 entangled (Franzini <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pantoja (2015) estimated 92 Manatees hunted in the area of the lower Javari river, Brazil, between 1980 and 2014. Based on interviews conducted in the Piagaçu Purus SDR (Purus river, Brazil), approximately 460 Manatees were killed in the protected area between 2004 and 2014 (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Based on 48 interviews, 36 manatees were captured in the Region of the Middle Madeira and Aripuanã Rivers (Amazon, Brazil) between 1986-2004: 89% poached and 11% entangled (Castelblanco-Martínez<em> et al</em>. 2007).</p><p> </p>  <p>The Natütama Foundation, which has a year-round Manatee monitoring program in place since 2002, registered three Manatees hunted in Colombia from 2003 to 2013 (Kendall 2013) and more than six in Peru from 2010-2015. Manatees are still being hunted in the river Putumayo upstream from Tarapaca and above the mouth of the Igaraparana, according to interviews with local Colombian fishermen, who say most of the hunters are Peruvian (S. Kendall pers. obs.). </p>  <p>In the Pacaya Samiria Reserve (Peru), Soto (2007) estimated an average of 35 Manatees killed in the basins of the Punahua, Ucayali and Marañon rivers.</p>  <p><strong>Incidental mortality, orphaned calves, and illegal captivity</strong></p>  <p>In addition to specific gillnets to hunt Manatees, the high use of fishing nets in the Amazon has increased incidental calf mortality in the past few years. These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs). In the past 10 years CPPMA received 39 calves for rehabilitation (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016).</p>  <p>From 2010-2015, 3 calves died in nets or captivity in Peru (S. Kendall pers obs). It is estimated that two Amazonian Manatees are presently in captivity in Colombia (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>Between 2007 and 2010, Centro de Rescate Amazónico (Iquitos, Peru) rescued 28 Manatees (Perea <em>et al. </em>2011), and until 2013 successfully rehabilitated 25 individuals (Landeo-Yauri <em>et al. </em>2013). Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto Nariño (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of Belém and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda Leão <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Most of the waters inhabited by Amazonian Manatees are very murky and, probably as an adaptation to the past and ongoing hunting pressure, Amazonian Manatees are extremely secretive.&#160;T<span class=""alt-edited"">remendous<span class=""shorttext""> research efforts have been made,<span lang=""EN""> but&#160;there are no reliable population estimates available, although numbers are almost certainly lower than historical figures due to centuries of hunting. Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014). A Manatee is held for show to tourists in Puerto Alegria, Peru, upstream from Leticia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Manatees are protected by national laws in all countries of confirmed distribution (Brazil since 1967, Colombia since 1969, Peru since 1973 (Silva 2009) and Ecuador since 2002 (Tirira 2011)). Listed under Appendix I of CITES, signed by the four countries, also signatories of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All but Colombia are parties to the Convention on Migratory Species.</p><p>Presently there are national management plans specific for the species in Colombia (Dirección de Ecosistemas 2005) and Brazil (Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2011) and for aquatic mammals (including Manatees) in Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Management plans exist for two protected areas (Pacaya Samiria in Peru and Mamiraua Reserve in Brazil), and Puerto Nariño (Colombia) has informal local management agreement (S. Kendall pers. obs).</p><p>In 2014 the Biodiversity department of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador included Manatee as a focal species for conservation, and relative abundance studies are planned for the Cuyabeno-Yasuni corridor in the Napo river basin between 2016 and 2018. The same department is attempting to have the corridor between the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and the Yasuní National Park recognized as a RAMSAR site (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2016)</p><p>Amazonian Manatees have been recorded from two protected areas in Ecuador, three in Colombia, four in Peru and at least 53 in Brazil (D. Souza pers. obs). Unfortunately, hunting continues even within protected areas.</p><p>Some 90% of the possible area of distribution of Manatees in Colombia is outside of protected areas. In Colombia the conservation work has been greatly based on participation of local communities (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Efforts include year-round conservation and monitoring by the Natütama Foundation in the key areas of the Colombian Amazon, with information network for nearby areas; intensive education program<a name=""_GoBack""></a> in the Colombian Amazon, with occasional visits to Tarapaca on the Putumayo river; release of calves by fishermen in the Colombian Amazon (Kendall 2013): 4 releases from nets from 2010-2015 by Natutama and associated fishermen (S. Kendall pers obs).</p><p>Ex-situ research at INPA captive setting (Brazil) and in Amazon Rescue Center (Peru)&#160;is providing the most information about the ecology and biology of the Amazonian Manatee, as reproductive hormone dosages, morphometric, allometric and growth studies of individuals, determination of nutritional parameters of milk in different states of lactation, evaluation of the animal health status, vocalization and acoustic ontogeny, among others.</p><p>Efforts of releasing rehabilitated Manatees back to the wild have been conducted by Mamirauá Institute (Marmontel 2012, 2015), INPA (Rosas and da Silva 2008, Souza <em>et al. </em>2012), ICMBio (Luna <em>et al. </em>2012) in Brazil, Amazon Rescue Center (Landeo-Yauri and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Sánchez-Babilonia 2015) in Peru, and Omacha Foundation in Colombia (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014).

45176906,11790,Lepus flavigularis,Endangered,A2bcd; B1ab(iii)c(iv)+2ab(iii)c(iv),2019,2018-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 769 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is less than 100 km² (Sántiz <em>et al.</em>  2016 modelled the current [2014] suitable habitat = AOO at 92.74 km²),  thus triggering the EN category under criteria B1 and B2.  Further, there are only four separated and small populations of  Tehuantepec Jackrabbit (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2018) and quantified  population censuses from 2001–2016 have documented a severe decline  (approaching 80% in the 10-year period beginning in 2006) in the population (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2017), thus triggering the EN category under criterion A2. These censuses also indicate  that the population undergoes extreme fluctuations. Ongoing decline in  the quality and quantity of habitat utilized by the species, coupled  with an increase in anthropogenic stressors further threaten this  species. These stressors include overgrazing, burning of pastures, an  increase in human settlements, poaching, and completion with domestic  dogs. The isolation of the four subpopulations also contributes to the  likelihood of increased inbreeding which can further jeopardize the  fitness of these animals.","At present, the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is restricted to grasslands with  open shrub and tree cover, and coastal grassy dunes which never exceed a  4-5 km wide strip along the shores of salt water lagoons on the north  side of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Tropical dry savannas of native grasses  (<em>Paspalum and Bouteloua</em>) with an over story of sparse bushes (<em>Byrsonima  crassifolia</em>, <em>Opuntia</em> <em>decumbens</em>, <em>Opuntia tehuantepecana</em>), and scattered  trees (<em>Crescentia </em>spp.) are the vegetation communities selected by  Tehuantepec Jackrabbits (Lorenzo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2006). Tehuantepec Jackrabbits are also found in xeric shrub and coastal  grassy dunes dominated by species like Donkey Grass (<em>Jouvea pilosa</em>),  and grasslands associated with cacti (<em>Opuntia </em>spp.) and some shrub  species such as Black Sage (<em>Cordia curassavica</em>), Manchineel (<em>Hippomane  mancinella</em>), and Cuachalalate (<em>Amphipterygium adstringens</em>)  (Carrillo-Reyes <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Preference by  adults was shown for areas with greater visibility for escaping  predation during the hours they are active (Farías and Fuller 2009).  Juveniles showed preference for areas with more over story. Both adults  and juveniles chose areas with shrubbery for protection while resting  (Farías and Fuller 2009). Low tolerance to habitat degradation (Lorenzo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2006), suggests that preservation of the preferred habitat structure is  important to the survival of this jackrabbit (Farías and Fuller 2009).<br/><br/>A  detailed analysis using satellite images from 2001 – 2014 of habitats  by type in the region occupied by Tehuantepec Jackrabbits showed that  their preferred savanna habitat declined by 16.5%, while unsuitable  habitat increased dramatically (seasonal agriculture +24.5%; human  settlements +26.6%; burned areas +142.8%; and areas without vegetation  +38.3%) (Lorenzo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2017). Savannas and  forests have increasingly been converted to pastures for livestock,  which increase trampling and loss of vegetation. The fires are set with  the intention of promoting regeneration of grasslands, but they often  become uncontrolled and then affect large parcels of land (Lorenzo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2017).<br/><br/>The  diet of Tehuantepec Jackrabbits is highly diverse; 18 vegetal species  are consumed in the dry season and 16 vegetal species in the rainy  season (of the families Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and herbs) in Montecillo  Santa Cruz. The highest percentages of consumption found were grasses  (<em>Bouteloua dactyloides</em>, <em>Cathestecum brevifolium</em>, and <em>Digitaria ciliaris</em>)  for both seasons of the year in that population (Lorenzo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Average  home range size of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit in Montecillo Santa Cruz  is 55 ha. Similar data from Santa María del Mar shows wide intraspecific  variation, with a range from 0.20 to 152 ha with a high level of  overlap between sexes and stations (over 70%). Therefore this population  does not exhibit exclusive home ranges, suggesting that Tehuantepec  Jackrabbits are not territorial (Farías <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Carrillo-Reyes <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>The  Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is polygamous. Over the course of the mating  season, males mated with three females, but females only allowed a  single male to mate (Rioja <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). The  length of the breeding season may extend from February to December,  with a peak in reproduction during the rainy season (from May to  October) (Farías 2004, Rioja <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008).  Mean litter size is two, with a range of one to four embryos (Farías  2004). The total length is between 49.9–64 cm (Lorenzo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2018). This species reaches maturity at six to seven months for both sexes (Farías 2004).<br/><br/>The  Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is primarily nocturnal, demonstrating more  activity at 18:40 ± 2 hr. The greater part of this period (12 ± 3  hours), is occupied in feeding, interspersed with periods of grooming  (with average duration of 12 ± 9 minutes), and socialization.  Tehuantepec Jackrabbits feed in a solitary manner, as well as in groups  of up to 13 hares eating together in an area with a radius equal to or  less than 50 m, without showing evidence of aggressive territorial  behavior (Carrillo-Reyes 2009).<br/><br/>Can serve as a prey item for native carnivores.<br/><br/>The  Tehuantepec Jackrabbit co-exists with the Eastern Cottontail  (<em>Sylvilagus floridanus</em>). Its main native predators are Coyotes (<em>Canis  latrans</em>) and Gray Foxes (<em>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</em>) (Farías 2004, López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009).","The change in land use that occurs with the increase in human  settlements has led to bad management and lack of control of productive  activities, such as ranching and the burning of pastures for seasonal  agriculture. The extent of occurrence of Tehuantepec Jackrabbits is  jeopardized by habitat alteration and degradation by introduction of  exotic grasses, human-induced fires, agriculture, cattle-raising  activities, and human settlements in savannas. These activities have  resulted in fragmentation of the habitat of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit,  so that their existing populations are almost completely isolated, and  most possess low genetic viability (Flux and Angermann 1990, Rico <em>et al.</em>  2008). Land use changes for activities such as livestock production and  agriculture, as well as the expansion of human settlements, are already  reducing the natural vegetation (savannas) of the Tehuantepec  Jackrabbit at a rate of 1.2% per year over a period of 26 years  (1986-2012) with a total loss of 6,850.6 ha (Sántiz <em>et al.</em> 2016).  Human-induced fires in the savanna accounted for 20% of adult deaths.  Historically, excessive hunting is another anthropogenic factor that  caused the decrease of population densities of this species,  contributing to its current situation (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2017,  2018). In addition, the species is shot by numerous parties of hunters  coming from cities up to 200 km away to shoot deer by spotlighting at  night. Poaching accounted for 13% of adult deaths, and for 6% of  juvenile deaths.<br/><br/>Possible species competing for food (Eastern  Cottontail and cattle) and predators (<em>Coyotes </em>and foxes) of Tehuantepec  Jackrabbits may be affecting their populations. Direct observations in  Santa María del Mar point to domestic dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>), Rat  Snakes (<em>Masticophis mentovarius</em>), and Deaf Snakes (<em>Trimorphodon  biscutatus</em>) as the main predators of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit (Rioja <em>et al.</em>  2011). Predation was the major cause of mortality for radio-marked  jackrabbits and accounted for 94% of juvenile deaths and 67% of adult  deaths during a 29 month study. In San Francisco del Mar Pueblo Viejo  and Aguachil, cattle and horses can act as potential competitors of food  and transmitters of diseases of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit (Rioja  2008).","The four populations are each isolated from one other. Recently (2001-2016), densities of 1.4-4 jackrabbits per km² have been reported for  the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit (Lorenzo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, 2008,  2017), and drastic declines in density have been recorded over these 15  years of monitoring. These changes have been partially attributed to  management practices such as prescribed burning and grazing (Lorenzo <em><em>et al.</em></em>2008,  2017). Average density (individuals/km²) ranged from 15.5 (range: 13-17.5; 2006-2010) to a low of 3.15 (range: 1.4-6; 2011-2016). The  quantified census protocol that yielded these data support the  documented decline of nearly 80% (Lorenzo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).<br/><br/>A phylogeography study showed that the four isolated populations are made up of two clades with low genetic diversity (Rico <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2008). The populations at Montecillo Santa Cruz, San Francisco del Mar  Viejo, and Aguachil make up one panmictic clade, while the isolated,  western-most population at Santa María del Mar makes up the second (Rico  <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Given this information, the two genetically  diverse groups should be treated as evolutionary significant units with  regard to future conservation measures (Rico <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).",Decreasing,"The Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is currently restricted to four isolated populations around the Laguna Superior and Laguna Inferior of the Tehuantepec Isthmus, Oaxaca, Mexico: Montecillo Santa Cruz, San Francisco del Mar Pueblo Viejo, Aguachil and Santa María del Mar (Lorenzo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Lorenzo <em>et al</em>. 2018). According to Chapman <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.</em> (1983) this species existed only from Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to the extreme west of the State of Chiapas, Mexico. Tehuantepec Jackrabbits have not been found in Chiapas (Retana and Lorenzo 2002). The area occupied in the past was apparently 150 km², but increasing clearance for agriculture has destroyed much of its habitat. The former distribution of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is not documented in detail, but Nelson (1909) estimated its historic range as occupying the Mexican Pacific Coast on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from Salina Cruz in Oaxaca to Tonalá in Chiapas, an area of perhaps only 5,000 km². Four populations of Tehuantepec Jackrabbit persist, and the current extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 769 km². This jackrabbit inhabits altitudes of no more than 500 m (Lorenzo <em>et al</em>. 2006).",This species is hunted locally for subsistence and very occasionally taken as a pet.,Terrestrial,"The Tehuantepec Jackrabbit is listed as endangered in the Mexican  Official Norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT 2010). Its conservation  should focus on establishment of appropriate management strategies for  grassland and savanna communities. Specifically, grasses should be  controlled annually by fire; livestock-raising practices should be  improved to avoid a negative impact on grasses; a program of  reproduction of jackrabbits in protected enclosures should be developed;  and a Communal Ecological Reserve in the form of a Wildlife Use and  Management Unit, established and administrated by community authorities,  with universities as technical advisory role, should be implemented  (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2017).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

45196929,4806,Chrotogale owstoni,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered A2bcd, A3bcd, A4cd because of an ongoing population decline, inferred to exceed 50% over the last three generations (taken as 15 years) and suspected to continue for the next three. This is inferred from over-exploitation, with habitat fragmentation exacerbating the speed at which the species is being extirpated. Hunting is a severe threat because the species is primarily ground-dwelling and so is exposed to the very high levels of snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping throughout its range. This assessment is made without any direct quantification of decline rate. Two largely sympatric ungulates&#160;of broadly similar generation lengths, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, are proposed as Critically Endangered under the same criteria for the same reasons. Owston's Civet has always been and remains more widespread than them, and unlike them there is still evidence of&#160;several&#160;high-density&#160;Owston's Civet&#160;populations. While this does not necessarily mean the civet's overall population decline rate is lower, the lower category for Owston's Civet is assigned based on its wider occurrence in montane forest (in which this civet is known to live, in some areas commonly, and up to 2,600 m) and karst (which is predicted to hold viable populations). These habitats, which contain some areas of very rugged and/or highland terrain into which industrial snaring has not yet widely spread, are apparently not occupied by the two ungulates. If market forces drive intensive snaring also into these habitats, then Critically Endangered would be the appropriate category for future decline rates of Owston's Civet given its apparent rapid extirpation across some heavily snared parts of Viet Nam.","Owston’s Civet occurs in a variety of habitats, all within evergreen biomes, linked by the common feature of a non-harsh dry season. It is, or was, much more widely spread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, reflecting the much larger area of Viet Nam with significant humidity in the driest months (i.e., lacking a harsh dry season).&#160;The pattern of locality records in Lao PDR where the species is evidently naturally localised&#160;quite clearly shows that the species has a narrow&#160;habitat usage. Areas with&#160;a non-harsh dry season&#160;in Lao PDR are restricted (Timmins and Trinh 2001).&#160;The areas providing high encounter rates of Owston's Civet in Lao PDR are adjacent to low sections of the Annamite spine (the north-south mountain range forming much of the international border between Lao PDR and Viet Nam) that allow moisture-bearing winds from Viet Nam during Lao PDR's dry season, which in the rest of the country is harsh at lower and mid altitudes (Timmins and Trinh 2001, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Sivilay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Many other evergreen forest survey areas across the country lack records,&#160;despite the use therein of methods suitable to find the species, at adequate intensities, and the finding of multiple hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling mammals,&#160;It is essentially absent from the predominant evergreen forest types of Lao PDR, lowland, mid-elevation and lower montane semi-evergreen (dry evergreen) and lower montane forests. This is based on spotlighting in several survey areas supporting these forest types in the early - mid 1990s (Duckworth 1997) and on camera-trapping in the 21st century in Phou Sithon, Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), Laving-Laveun NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area and Xe Sap NBCA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the hunting intensity in all of these at the time of camera-trapping was equivalent to Pu Mat before (sometimes well before) 1998, about when the species was still readily detected by camera-traps. It is evidently locally present in Lao PDR below 1,000 m where wet evergreen forest occurs, but the absence of records from Laving-Laveun NBCA, which holds various other wet&#160;evergreen forest species,&#160;suggests that Owston's Civet is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. It also occurs in montane evergreen forest (over 1,000 m), but is probably equally restricted by climatic conditions in its geographic and altitudinal range. Montane areas&#160;with wet climates, such as various high peaks in eastern parts of Lao PDR, appear to support the species over a relatively wide range (e.g., Xe Sap NBCA; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whilst peaks further west (greater rain-shadowing during the winter) appear to support more localised populations (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wet evergreen forest is, or was, far more widespread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, but it is not universal. The strong evidence from Lao PDR for climatic sensitivity of Owston's Civet suggests that some Viet Namese evergreen forests will hold the species sparsely or not at all (those in a&#160;rain-shadow).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Annamite wet evergreen forest of Lao PDR, Owston's Civet has been recorded as high as suitable survey has occurred (1,500 m; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The few records from Lao PDR's northern highlands, mostly imprecisely located (barring that in Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009), are likely to come from higher altitudes where the colder temperatures ameliorate the low dry-season rainfall. Thus, in Lao PDR Owston's Civet is likely to occur&#160;mostly in hill and montane altitudes, although there are credible reports from as low as 550 m (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whereas in Viet Nam the species has a wide altitudinal range, right down to the plains and up to 2,600 m (Van Ban district, Lao Kay province, in 2002; S. Swan pers. comm. 2014). Recent camera-trap records at&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, in the northern highlands of Viet Nam, come from altitudes of 1,722-2,444 m a.s.l.; there was very little survey effort below 1,700 m (B.M. Rawson pers, comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Captive animals in both Viet Nam and the U.K. relish earthworms (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014) and the species's skull and dentition suggest an invertebrate diet (Thomas 1927). An earthworm-dominated diet would explain the tight linkage with year-round humidity, given that in the parts of Lao PDR with a harsh dry season earthworms are not accessible during that season. This remains purely speculative, especially given that the component of Owston's Civet range south of the northern highlands resembles that of various other species unlikely to depend directly on access to earthworms, e.g. Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>&#160;and Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>.<br/><br/>Suitable forests, in Viet Nam at least, include some on limestone and some dominated by bamboo (Roberton 2007). There are indications from Lao PDR of occurrence in degraded and edge habitat such as banana gardens (King 2002), but these remain to be confirmed. The lack of records from deciduous forest surely reflects the genuine pattern of occurrence.<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has not been studied in the field, but camera-trapping indicates that it is nocturnal, largely solitary and presumably largely active at ground level (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), although there is at least one record of a wild animal 3 m up a tree (Dang and Le 2010). The species climbs well in captivity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).","Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the two countries holding most of the geographic range of Owston's Civet, have among the highest levels of non-specific mammal hunting in the world. For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats <em>Panthera</em>, wild cattle <em>Bos</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs,&#160;rather than by passive trapping; and it is&#160;by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.<br/><br/>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.<br/><br/>The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the&#160;species&#160;depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.","The total population of Owston's Civet will always have been much smaller than that of most other mainland South-east Asian civets because it has such a small geographic range. There is insufficient&#160;baseline information to define the precise&#160;range and even the general abundance in the era before trade-driven hunting began to accelerate steeply in the 1980s with the increasingly wide deployment of cable-snares in long lines linked by brushwood drift fences. Therefore, its population trend needs to be inferred from trends in habitat and in hunting (types, distributions and intensities), based on a hypothesised geographic and ecological distribution, itself inferred from habitat (from which the known precisely located records come) and distributions of ecologically restricted co-occurring species.<br/><br/>Severe declines probably started in the early 1990s, Around this time, evidence suggests other ground-dwelling, now much-declined, Annamite-centred species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> and&#160;Edwards’s Pheasant <em>Lophura edwardsii</em>&#160;were, by today’s standards, still common in accessible Viet Namese forests. Camera-trapping in the late 1990s in Pu Mat Nature Reserve and in Huong Son district (SFNC 2000, Timmins and Trinh 2001) suggested that the species was still relatively common in mid-elevation forests where hunting pressure was already relatively intense. The number of animals in trade in the 1990s (e.g., at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in Lao PDR; received by the Owston’s Civet Project at&#160;Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam; and observed in trade near Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and as&#160;stuffed specimens along route 1, both Viet Nam) all suggest the species was frequent thereabouts, presumably in the mid-elevation forest where the bulk of snaring was then taking place. There is no pointer, when the difficulties of detecting this species by typical pre-camera-trap surveys are accounted for, to suggest that Owston’s Civet was not a common species throughout mid-elevation Vietnamese wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section), prior to the advent of intensive snaring.<br/><br/>Within its range, it evidently reached, and locally still reaches, high densities within favoured habitat. Bourret (1944) considered it to be the most common civet between the Fansipan mountains and the Black river in northern Viet Nam. Two camera-trapping surveys in Viet Nam around the turn of the century, one in the Hoang Lien mountains in the north-west of the country and the other in Pu Mat Nature Reserve in the northern Annamites found this civet to be among the most commonly photographed small carnivores in these areas (SFNC 2000, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004). Pu Mat NR has not been resurveyed, but this assessment&#160;is still appropriate for the highland areas of Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, both in/near the Hoan Lien mountains, in 2013 camera-trapping (B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). The same was found in 2012-2013 in Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b) and during the preceding decade in parts of eastern Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In some other areas that it has been found, it has been among the least recorded species by camera-trap, e.g. Quang Nam province, Viet Nam (Long and Minh 2006), western Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Nam Et-Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The patterns&#160;of the other hunting-sensitive species recorded by these surveys suggest that Owston's Civet abundance is highly heterogeneous dependent upon habitat, not that the low encounter rates in these areas are&#160;solely a result of overhunting (although this&#160;might be responsible in part or whole for the low encounter rate in Quang Nam).<br/><br/>However, hunting is likely to be the explanation for the stark temporal pattern shown by the review of camera-trapping in Viet Nam by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Of the five camera-trapping surveys operating in Viet Nam during&#160;1998–2006, all found Owston’s &#160;Civet; the four in 2006–2013 all did not. (Two additional sites surveyed in the latter period, Cat Tien NP and U Minh, also did not find&#160;Owston’s Civet but are excluded from the comparison as being outside the species's likely range.) Very recent (late 2013) camera-trapping in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve (Kon Tum province, Viet Nam) and two northern highland sites,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, found Owston's Civet to be one of most commonly photographed small carnivores (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014,&#160;B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). These anomalies within the 2006-2013 time period, not available in time for the Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) review, are both in very mountainous areas consequently less economically appealing to market hunters. Higher hunting pressures, notably snaring intensities, typify most of the survey areas included in Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Excepting the results from Ngoc Linh NR,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, the lack of Viet Namese records from 2006 onwards suggests a major recent decline in the species in sites across the country with large populations&#160;left only in forested steep highland massifs. This suspected decline&#160;is corroborated by the failure of over 15,000 camera-trap-nights of effort in wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves, Viet Nam, since August 2012 to find the species (WWF pers. comm. to Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Nor has it been found in another lowland area of wet&#160;evergreen forest, Khe Nuoc Truong in Quang Binh province, where extensive camera-trapping recorded many other small carnivore species (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014). For none of these 2006-2013 Viet Nam camera-trap survey areas is there evidence of a pre-intensive-snaring large population of Owston' Civet. However, assessing them based on habitat and other Annamite wet evergreen forest species' status (see 'Habitats and ecology' section; R.J. Timmins [pers. comm. 2014] has&#160;surveyed in most of them and studied all on aerial imagery), Khe Nuoc Truong, Hoang Son, and non-limestone forests in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang area,&#160;are&#160;probably&#160;prime Owston’s Civet habitat; Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves are very similar to Pu Mat NR; and Ke Go is hard to know, because few other sites are topographically similar, and the topography influences local climate. Even Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>&#160;(among the least hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling wet evergreen forest species)&#160;has not been camera-trapped in the&#160;Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves;&#160;they are some of the most heavily hunted large forest blocks that R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014) has&#160;ever been to.<br/><br/>A decline of such magnitude was not suspected during the last Red List assessment for this species, for 2008. At that stage, all camera-trap surveys within its range typically found the species, sometimes commonly. The high encounter rates in some areas suggests a high starting population and thus a long time until near extirpation (and the concomitant ability of generalised camera-trapping to note a paucity of records). Another factor weighed for the 2008 listing as Vulnerable was that one of the surveys camera-trapping the species commonly, in Hoang Lien Son of far northern Viet Nam, was amid highly degraded and fragmented forest which had been subjected to high levels of traditional hunting for decades (see Swan and O'Reilly 2004) and thus the species was resilient to hunting pressure. However, it now seems more likely that Owston's Civet differs in sensitivity to different styles of hunting (see 'Threats'). The current overall population trend is thus assessed to be steeply downwards. Probably, the main phase of decline in Viet Nam has already occurred, with most areas holding the species there now having only low numbers with large populations persisting only in the northern highlands and most rugged part of the Annamites, Lao PDR, retaining much larger areas of forest without road incursion and a much lower human population, still retains at least one large population, plausibly several (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), but the national trend in 2015-2030 is likely to replicate that of Viet Nam in 1999-2014.<br/><br/>No information on the present population status in the Chinese part of the range was traced. Indeed, it is not clear that the species is still extant there.",Decreasing,"Owston's Civet is known to occur across a wide latitudinal range of both eastern Lao PDR (Sivilay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) and Viet Nam (Roberton&#160;2007,&#160;Dang and Le 2010), and in a small area of southernmost China, possibly only in Hekou, Luchun and Jinping counties of Yunnan province (Wang Ying-xiang 2003) but perhaps also in adjacent Guangxi province (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has not been found west of the Mekong river (Corbet and Hill 1992) and indeed occurrence in Lao PDR is restricted largely to the easternmost areas that have similarities in climate to Viet Nam. The range may also potentially extend into easternmost Cambodia: two individuals seen in the Phnom Tamao zoo (Phnom Penh) collection of stuffed mounts in the late 1990s were unlikely to have originated outside Cambodia (C.M. Poole pers. comm. to Dang and Le 2010). However, extensive surveys in Cambodia's eastern provinces have not found the species (e.g., Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, E.H.B. Pollard pers. comm. 2012). Perhaps the most likely area of Cambodia, eastern Virachey National Park, remains very little camera-trapped. Suitable methodology (camera-trapping and/or spotlighting) has been applied widely enough in the southern half of Lao PDR to be confident the species is entirely or largely restricted to the east in the south and latitudinal centre; capable searches have been less widespread in the northern highlands.<br/><br/>Records come from the range 100-2,600 m, but, particularly west of the Annamites, only a subset of this full range is likely to be occupied in any given area (see 'Habitats and ecology').","Owston's Civet is taken for meat and traditional medicine (including its bones, scent gland, and penis) in all of its range countries; there is not suspected to be any targeted hunting of the species, but much hunting in its range is non-selective (e.g. snares) to supply the general wildlife meat market (Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;B.

Dogs and cats do not seem to bother this species due to its potential to excrete a nauseating chemical from its anal glands (Widmann and Widmann 2004).

It is a high-altitude specialist living in the cloud forest and paramo of the Andes at elevations over 1,300 m. It is assumed that it is similar to other procyonids in that it is somewhat arboreal and omnivorous. Five principal food categories were found in mountain coati diet: invertebrates, vertebrates, fruits, vegetable remains and undetermined food items (Rodríguez-Bolaños <em>et al</em>.&#160;2000). Higher detection frequencies occur near <em>Chusquea</em> stands in elevations near Bogota (J.F. González-Maya <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).

Although multiple population estimates exist, the precautionary estimated typical total population size for Pygmy Raccoon in the wild is fewer than 250 mature individuals, and all research to date indicates&#160;a declining population. Although the actual number is likely to be very elastic over time (considering population fluctuations around tropical hurricanes) the overall trend is a rapid decline in mature individuals because of&#160;ongoing human encroachment&#160;(tourism, urban growth, development)&#160;into the very small remaining habitat fragments, invasive species (predators and pathogens), road expansion and the increasing magnitude and severity of hurricanes. Following is the rationale for Critically Endangered under C2a(ii)b:<br/><br/><strong>Criterion C:&#160;</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>mall population size and decline</strong><br/>Based on estimates of population size including juveniles (323-955), and &#160;an estimate that 59% of the population comprises mature individuals, the number of the latter is likely to&#160;range from 192 to 567. Following the precautionary principle by using the lower limit, the number of mature individuals is many fewer than 250.<br/><br/>C2a(ii): a continuing decline in the population size because of habitat loss and&#160;the effects of introduced species, with at least 90% of mature individuals in one subpopulation","Information on the ecology of Pygmy Raccoon has been summarized in Cuarón <em>et al</em>. (2004), McFadden (2004), and de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. (2011). Pygmy Raccoon prefers mangrove stands and sandy areas, but it is&#160;also found in semi-evergreen and sub-deciduous tropical forests and agricultural areas. Abundance varies considerable across&#160;vegetation types. Most of the population lives in the&#160;coastal areas of the island, and a large proportion of the central part of the island is&#160;uninhabited or has only a&#160;very low density. Pygmy Raccoon may inhabit areas near human settlements, and/or paved and unpaved roads (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).<br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoon is mainly nocturnal, although it is not uncommon to see it during daylight (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005).  Generally it is solitary, but sometimes forms&#160;family groups (Jones and Lawlor 1965,&#160;Cuarón&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). McFadden and Meiri (2013) concluded that dwarfism in the Pygmy Raccoon may be an insular adaptation to the fewer resources found on Cozumel Island compared with the mainland.<br/><br/>It is omnivorous, with a preference for crabs followed by fruits, insects, crayfish, and small vertebrates (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006). The relevance of the different food items varies strongly&#160;between seasons and sites, and following major changes in habitat quality because of hurricanes (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The Pygmy Raccoon is particularly vulnerable to introduced pathogens and diseases such as mange, rabies and dog distemper from exotic animals (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden 2004, Mena 2007).  The parasites <em>Eimeria nutalli</em>, <em>Placoconus lotoris</em>, <em>Capillaria procyonis</em>, a&#160;<em>Physaloptera</em> sp., a mite in the family Listrophoridae, and a trematode in the family Heterophyidae have been collected from <em>P. pygmaeus&#160;</em>(McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005).  The identification of <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> in some Pygmy Raccoons suggests a recent spillover from domestic cats (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Pygmy Raccoon has been exposed to infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper and feline panleukopenia viruses (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  <br/><br/>Pygmy Raccoons share the same mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, suggesting a recent population bottleneck that might be related to a founder effect (McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2008).","Cozumel Island has been substantially developed for tourism. Until about 2005, Cozumel was still relatively well-conserved, with close to 90% of the island covered by natural vegetation (Romero-Nájera 2004, Romero-Nájera <em>et al</em>. 2007), but the situation is deteriorating  rapidly. The interior of the island is less developed, but Pygmy Raccoon is rare or absent there (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  There is only a very small area of prime raccoon habitat and this is on the coast where most of the tourist development is taking place.<br/><br/>The expansion and widening of the road system is fragmenting the vegetation of the island in at least three areas (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). The widening of roads is potentially increasing their barrier effect and exacerbating their impact on the conservation of Pygmy Raccoon and other native species (de Villa-Meza <em>et al</em>. 2011). Most cases of Pygmy Raccoon mortality documented since 2001 have been the result of animals being run over by cars on the island's highways (García-Vasco 2005).<br/><br/>Alien invasive predators, such as the&#160;snake&#160;<em>Boa constrictor</em>, as well as domestic and feral dogs, may have an important impact on the Pygmy Raccoon population and it is confirmed that feral dogs predate them (Martínez-Morales and Cuarón 1999, García-Vasco 2005, Bautista 2006).  Additionally, introduced carnivores to the island could easily become a source of parasites and pathogens that could potentially affect negatively Pygmy Raccoon populations (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, McFadden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mena 2007).  The introduction of the closely related Northern Raccoon&#160;<em>P. lotor</em> (there are&#160;frequent vehicle ferries between the island and mainland),&#160;usually for pets, is a risk of genetic introgression and a potential source of parasites and pathogens (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Hurricanes are the main natural threat recognized for the Cozumel biota (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004, Perdomo 2006, Barillas 2007, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  For Pygmy Raccoon, hurricanes cause drastic population decline, reduction in the proportion of juveniles, direct injury, and facilitate pathological change (Copa-Alvaro 2007, Mena 2007). The frequency, magnitude and duration of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin is increasing (Goldenberg <em>et al</em>. 2001), so they are an issue of major concern because there may be a synergistic effect with anthropogenic disturbance.<br/><br/>Hunting and collection of Pygmy Raccoons as pets is currently not an important threat.","All individuals comprise a single subpopulation.&#160;The total subpopulation estimate for&#160;<em>P. pygmaeus</em>, including juveniles, ranges from 323 (McFadden 2004) to 955 (Copa-Alvaro 2007). Considering that 59.4% of captured individuals are adults (McFadden and Mairi 2013), then the estimated number of mature individuals ranges from 192 to 567.&#160;During 2006, a total of 105 different known individuals, including juveniles, was&#160;caught, indicating a total population of at least this number (Copa-Alvaro 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>Density estimates vary between sites and years, and range from 12.4 to 112 individuals/km² (McFadden 2004,&#160;Copa-Alvaro 2007).<br/><br/>Male-female ratios are fairly balanced: McFadden&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) conducted a subsample survey at two sites and of the total 96 Pygmy Raccoons captured, there were 47 males and 49 females. However García-Vasco (2005) found the proportion lightly skewed to females, but not significantly different from 1:1.<br/><br/>The species is severely affected by hurricanes and the population size fluctuates around these events. Because total population size is already severely depressed by human activities, it is increasingly difficult for the species to recover following these natural disasters. After major hurricanes,&#160;Pygmy Raccoon&#160;density can decline at a particular site by as much as 60% and the proportion of juveniles in the population can diminish significantly (Copa-Alvaro 2007).  The impact of hurricanes might vary between regions or vegetation types on the island (Copa-Alvaro 2007).",Decreasing,"Pygmy Raccoon is confined to Cozumel Island (189 square miles; 488 km²)&#160;off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico (Cuarón <em>et al</em>. 2004).

It has been recorded in disturbed (even urban) areas, in dry secondary forests, and thorn forests (Shekhar 2003). Shekhar (2003), in central India during 2002-2003, saw it near refuse bins and dumps, scavenging on carrion, and on roads. This species feeds on a wide variety of animal food including insects and snakes (Santiapillai <em>et al.</em> 2000).",Indian Grey Mongoose&#160;has no&#160;range-wide&#160;threats sufficient to drive significant population declines. It is likely that in some areas the levels of harvest are sufficient to reduce local densities. Over recent centuries the species has probably benefited from conversion of closed evergreen forest (at most only rarely occupied) to open habitats.,"Indian Grey Mongoose&#160;is mostly common, often abundant, in suitable habitat throughout its main range, but it is relatively rare in North-east India (A.U.

A mid-twentieth century introduction to Italy also failed (Gaubert and Zenatello 2009). Indian Grey Mongoose&#160;has not been introduced to the Ryukyu Islands (= Nansei Shotu; Japan) or Mauritius; previous reports from these islands reflect confusion with <em>Herpestes javanicus</em> (sensu lato)&#160;(S.

Itinerant people from northern India use hook snares to capture individuals for skins, which are then sold in local markets in Nepal (Shekhar 2003). In India, all mongoose species are in demand for the wildlife trade (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003): the meat is eaten by several tribes and the hair is used for making shaving brushes, paint brushes, and good luck charms (Hanfee and Ahmed 1999).

The species is found in a wide variety of open, edge, degraded and anthropogenic habitats; much of its range was until recently closed evergreen forest inimical to the species on the mainland, although occupied in Java. Records of the species from agricultural and peri-urban areas in Lao PDR, where hunting of wildlife has been very intense, indicate a high resilience to persecution, albeit probably at reduced density where such pressures are very high.","Javan Mongoose altitudinal distribution differs between mainland South-east Asia and Java; on Sumatra it is unknown. On Java the species has been camera-trapped from almost sea-level up to 1,800 m (A. Ario pers. comm. 2014). On the mainland the highest record traced comes from only 870 m, from Thailand, with two others over 700 m in that country (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In Vietnam, Roberton (2007) traced records only up to 400 m. In Lao PDR, most records are from below 250 m, with one area (of plateau topography) at 520-530 m also holding the species (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010). In peninsular Malaysia, all records known to Wells (1989) were from the plains. The few recent localities in&#160;Myanmar traced by Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008)&#160;(for&#160;this species and/or&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>) are also at plains level. Records from Cambodia are also mostly lowland with one outlying site, a marsh, at 560 m (Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The aggregate survey effort, including out-of-formal-observation time, in mid altitudes across mainland South-east Asia is sufficiently high that it is quite clear that the wide altitudinal range in Java is not replicated on the mainland. Overall, on the mainland most records come from below 300 m with localised occurrence to 870 m, mostly in areas of anomalously gentle terrain.<br/><br/>Most records with accurate observer-assigned habitats come from degraded or anthropogenic habitats, although in Java the species is commonly encountered in closed forest, as well as in open habitats such as suburban gardens, degraded forest edge, and pine and <em>Agathis damara</em> production forests&#160;(A. Ario pers. comm. 2014). On the mainland, careful inspection of records that are from evergreen forest areas usually shows them to come from deforested exclaves, such as from settlement or cultivation rather than within the forest itself (Thailand: W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014; Lao PDR; Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Across its range the species uses: plantations and other anthropogenic habitats with bushes around human residences (A. Ario pers. comm. 2014), including urban areas such as residential gardens in parts of Bogor (N. Brickle pers. comm. 2010) (Java); ""bamboo and other scrubland, rough plantations including young teak, <em>Imperata</em>&#160;grassland and paddy and sugar-cane fields"" (Wells 1989: 96; peninsular Malaysia); mostly disturbed and edge areas,&#160;including extensive farmland and suburban areas, but including little-encroached deciduous dipterocarp forest (especially or solely near surface water) and, once, several kilometers into little-encroached, closed canopy semi-evergreen forest (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010;&#160;Lao PDR); and grassland, scrub, villages, rice paddies, pineapple plantations, secondary forest (including&#160;semi-evergreen), deciduous forest (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Thailand). Agricultural habitats are particularly prevalent in videos of hunting of this species available in Thai on You-tube (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Whilst there are a fair number of records in non-Sundaic South-east Asia from little encroached deciduous forest (e.g., Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010), occupation of such habitats is far from universal in Cambodia and Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the species seems perhaps only to occur near permanent surface water. Despite the near-absence of records from interior closed evergreen forest in the mainland, the species freely uses opened-up areas in evergreen biomes (e.g., Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;The species also uses artificial banana-dominated embankments that border active seasonally inundated <em>Melaleuca </em>plantations (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>This species is ground-dwelling, almost solely diurnal and usually observed singly or, occasionally, as duos (e.g. Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Other aspects of natural history are poorly known, given that much information published under the name '<em>Herpestes javanicus</em>' refers to <em>H. aurropunctatus</em>, not to <em>H.&#160;</em><em>javanicus</em>&#160;as defined here. It is possible that its natural history has never been studied in the field.","There are presently no known significant threats to Javan Mongoose. Numbers are probably restrained in Lao PDR and Viet Nam by the very heavy hunting typical in areas used by people, but even so the species is still seen occasionally in the suburbs of big towns (Duckworth <em>et al</em>.&#160;2010). It is also hunted in the agricultural parts of Thailand with various videos of hunts available on You-tube (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). The numbers traded in Medan, Sumatra (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004), are large for the apparently small occupied area of the island, but the enormous markets for pets etc. in Java apparently trade rather few (Shepherd 2012). Habitat changes across the region are likely to have benefited the species strongly over the past century, with large-scale fragmentation, degradation and outright conversion of closed evergreen forest into habitats used by this species. Although the species has not been recorded from heavily urbanised areas (i.e. with no significant garden or parkland component) such habitats still comprise a negligible proportion of its range. The high overlap of its range with agriculture exposes it to the risk of chemical threats with the ever-changing variety of agrochemicals in use. In addition, whilst&#160;it is well recorded from unintensified agriculture and agriculture close to scrub and other (at least temporarily) uncultivated areas, its ability to use large landscapes dominated by intensified wet rice production is not well known (other than that it does occur in them). These cover large parts of Java, Thailand and Viet Nam, and increasing parts of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Myanmar, peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra.","Javan Mongoose's habitat use overlaps little with that of most wildlife survey and research. Thus, country reviews of recent small carnivore status have typically traced few&#160;Javan Mongoose&#160;records (e.g., Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Records from activities in anthropogenic habitats, such as birdwatching and, in some countries, suburban living&#160;show that&#160;the species is evidently common, at least in peninsular Malaysia, Java, Cambodia and Thailand&#160;(Wells 1989, N. Brickle&#160;pers. comm. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014, A. Ario pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Records in Lao PDR are rather scarce, presumably because of the very heavy wildlife persecution in most settled areas (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). The species's abundance in Viet Nam is not clear, although it can be seen regularly in some heavily modified habitats, e.g. around staff accommodation in the buffer zone of Cuc Phuong National Park (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).&#160;In Myanmar, where village harvest of small carnivores and other similar-sized mammals is typically much lower than in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the species (and/or&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;is so common in places that it is trapped by conservation agencies as a pest (Su Su 2005). The status in Sumatra is not clear: it is typically perceived as an enigma (e.g., Jennings and Veron 2011, Holden and Meijaard 2012) but Shepherd <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that it was one of the most commonly traded species&#160;(and the second most commonly traded carnivore)&#160;in the pet markets of Medan, Sumatra; every dealer questioned said that the animals were wild-caught in Aceh (C. R. Shepherd pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The population trend is not directly known for any part of the range. Broad-scale habitat trends and the species's observed habitat use indicate that the heavy deforestation of recent decades has created much new habitat. The effect of the rapid intensification of, in particular, wet rice agriculture is unknown. In Thailand triple-crop irrigated rice supports massive rodent pest densities, such that rodent harvest is itself a big business for farmers, with many sold at roadside stalls (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014), thereby providing a ready food supply for mongooses; the species certainly uses such habitat in Thailand (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Set against this, high agrochemical application might be problematic, particularly for predators, and the reduction of unkempt corners and edge, which might be expected to provide important cover, might make such agricultural land less suitable for the&#160;species. This type of farming is increasing widely across the species's range. in some areas, notably Viet Nam, hunting levels&#160;are too high for the species to be common in this sort of agriculture (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).",Unknown,"Javan Mongoose occurs from Java through Sumatra (perhaps only the northern fifth)&#160;and mainland South-east Asia to uncertain&#160;northern and western extents. Veron <em>et al</em>. (2006) proposed that these limits lie within China, Myanmar and perhaps Thailand. The long-standing treatment of this species as conspecific with <em>H. auropunctatus</em>&#160;(under the name&#160;Small Asian Mongoose&#160;<em>H. javanicus</em>) and a paucity of specimen or other evidence available for re-examination from China, Lao PDR, northern Thailand and Myanmar hampers confident assignment of range (see extended, detailed discussion in&#160;Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). The many introduced populations of&#160;<em>H. javanicus</em>&#160;<em>sensu lato</em> around the world are all believed to be of&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>, but further confirmation is desirable (Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/>Across most of&#160;its range,&#160;Javan Mongoose is rather rarely recorded by conventional conservation-oriented surveys, reflecting the need for these surveys to focus on habitats of high conservation relevance (notably closed evergreen forest)&#160;and this species's limited occurrence in such habitats (see 'Habitats and ecology' section). This hinders clarification of the distribution within each&#160;range&#160;state. In Lao PDR the species (not confirmed not also to include&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;has been recorded only in the south and centre of the country, where plains are extensive; there seem to be no records from the northern third (where plains are limited) (that mapped for the far north in Veron <em>et al</em>. [2006] is an error for central Viet Nam; Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). It is unclear whether the lack of records from northern Lao PDR reflects&#160;a natural absence from there, a hunting-induced extirpation (more likely to occur in areas, such as this, where suitable habitat occurs as small isolates and is heavily used by people) or the limited relevant search effort at low altitudes in this predominantly highland area (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Thailand, most of the recent records of this species (not confirmed not also to include&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;traced by Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) came from the lowland south and centre of the country, with none from north of&#160;17°03'N;&#160;as with Lao PDR, northern Thailand is predominantly highland. However, there are at least a few records (apparently left open as to species by Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006) from further north in Thailand,&#160;such as one from&#160;Chiang Mai at 18°47’N, 98°59’E (Chasen 1935). Vietnamese records (of this species (not confirmed not also to include&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>) traced by Roberton (2007) came from a wide spread of the country including the far north (which has&#160;large highland areas but a greater proportion than in northern Lao PDR or Thailand of lowlands); although there was none from the Mekong delta, there are subsequent records for the U Minh wetlands and it seems to be one of the more common small carnivores in the delta (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). In Myanmar, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no records from recent formal wildlife survey, but knew of occurrence&#160;(of this species and/or&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;in two peri-urban areas of Yangon; information from elsewhere in the country was too limited for the lack of other such records to suggest absence or&#160;scarcity there. There are recent records in Cambodia from the north-east and south-west (e.g. Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014), and the north (Stung Treng province) and north-west (Preah Vihear province) (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).&#160;In peninsular Malaysia, Wells (1989) traced records from many localities west of the main mountain range, but not from the east; a later collation (Jennings and Veron 2011) also seems to have found none in this eastern region.

45217088,41690,Arctictis binturong,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-02-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Vulnerable because of a population decline, estimated to be more than 30% over the last 18 years (three generations), inferred from shrinkage in distribution through habitat destruction and degradation, as well as over-exploitation (for both local use and wildlife trade). Habitat loss over this period has been the predominant driver of decline in the southern (Sundaic) portion of the range, where a significant proportion of lowland habitats have been converted to other land-uses that do not support the species e.g. oil palm plantations. In the northern portion of the range the rampant hunting and trade of mammals in this size-class (within northern South-east Asia and up into China; e.g. Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004), within which Binturong is a significant part, has severely depressed populations even within remaining large blocks of little-degraded forest (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014; Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3). Populations in the northern range continue to be threatened by wildlife hunting and by the recent proliferation of agro-industries and other forms of forest conversion in the region, which are causing habitat loss in some protected areas that potentially still hold the species. Thus the species is considered to be experiencing population declines sufficient to meet the threshold for Vulnerable in this northern part of its range on the basis of actual or potential levels of exploitation, with habitat loss being an additional factor (e.g. WWF 2013). In the Sundaic portion of the range, habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands (e.g.&#160;Holmes 2000;&#160;BirdLife International 2001; Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001; McMorrow and Talip 2001; Lambert and Collar 2002; Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004; Fuller 2004;&#160;Sodhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010;&#160;Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014; Stibig&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This forest loss, particularly in the lowlands, is predicted to continue within the next three generations within parts of the species’s range (e.g. Borneo). However, in other parts, much lowland forest has already gone, and future forest loss, proportionate to what remains, is likely to slow down in some areas. Because there is no evidence that Binturong uses the plantations that,&#160;largely,&#160;are replacing natural forest in this region (e.g. Semiadi <em>et al</em>. in prep.), major declines can be inferred based on decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality. There is insufficient information about Binturong usage of high-altitude forests (where forest is being lost more slowly), however, it is certainly not primarily a montane species and lowland forest habitats are thought to be the most suitable, and on this basis the populations in the Sundaic portion of the range are also judged to be declining at rates sufficient to warrant listing as Vulnerable, mainly through habitat loss compounded with killing and capture.","Binturong is primarily arboreal, but does descend to the ground; in fact the number of camera-trap photographs of this species across its range reveals a level of ground activity higher than had previously been unexpected for this species. Also, the species has been caught in baited live traps set on the ground (Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is heavy and ponderous (adults can reach over 20 kg), and where more agile arboreal animal species could leap between trees, it must descend to the ground to go from one tree to another (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The ecology of this species is poorly known and might vary between areas; information about diel activity is&#160;conflicting. Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted it to be crepuscular and nocturnal, &#160;and targeted small carnivore surveys at a logging concession in Sarawak, Borneo (Malaysia), recorded the species only during the early morning and during the night (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010). By contrast,&#160;Nettelbeck (1997) found it often to be active during the day, and many other day-time field sightings have been made incidentally during forest research (e.g. Lambert 1990, Datta 1999, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sayam Chowdhury pers. comm. 2015). Activity patterns have also been described as cathemeral (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>In&#160;Phu Kieo Wildlife Sanctuary,&#160;Thailand, Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) found that males have a mean annual range size of 6.2 km² with a mean overlap of 35%. A single female Binturong tracked in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary had a home range of 6.9 km² (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2015). The species is thought to be predominantly frugivorous. There is a detailed observation of a group of Binturongs feeding on figs <em>Ficus&#160;</em>over several nights in North-east India (Murali <em>et al</em>. 2013), and many of the incidental observations of the species are of animals in fruiting trees (e.g. Lambert 1990, Nettelbeck 1997, Datta 1999, Low 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, recent records are from extensive evergreen forest, (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the Philippines, the species is found in primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland-forest mosaic from sea level to 400 m (Rabor 1986, Esselstyn <em>et al</em>. 2004). It was recorded in secondary forest, that had been logged in the 1970s, and which surrounds a palm estate, in Malaysia in 2000–2001 by Azlan (2003). Mathai <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded the species in a logging concession, although never amid active logging; all records were from patches of forest with medium to high relative levels of contiguity. In Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, the Binturong was camera-trapped in all surveys of forest areas throughout the state, including primary and logged forest, but was not detected in oil palm plantations. &#160;In one survey it was detected at over 1,000 m a.s.l. (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald unpublished data). Elsewhere in Borneo it has been recorded down almost to sea-level (e.g. Sabangau National Park, Central Kalimantan; Semiadi et al. in prep.). Meijaard <em>et al</em>. (2008) classified the species as tolerant of moderate intensity logging, and it has been recorded from logged forest on Borneo (Samejima <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Bangladesh the few confirmed records are from hill evergreen forest in the north-east and south-east (Chakma 2015, Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). In Java the species has been observed in a mosaic open forest landscape, interspersed with agriculture and non-native forest plantations, where, in the&#160;several years of&#160;survey,&#160;there was only a single record of hunting of nocturnal mammals (Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014); the species is never (or only exceptionally rarely) recorded in such landscapes in northern South-east Asia, which are invariably hunted heavily, perhaps explaining this difference. There are no records of this species from within blocks of monoculture plantations such as palm oil or rubber.<br/><br/>The litter size is typically one to three, with a gestation of about 92 days, reaching adult size in one year; individuals may live as long as 18 years (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Litter size in captivity is one to six, most commonly two. Observations in captivity have shown that copulation usually takes place in trees.","Habitat loss and degradation are major threats to the Binturong (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989) as is fragmentation, particularly in those parts of the range where hunting is heavy. Throughout this species's range, there has been loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2010; WWF 2013, 2015; Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). Forest conversion has been extremely high in the lower-altitude parts of its Sundaic range in the last 20 years (e.g. Holmes 2000,&#160;BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003, Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006, Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014, Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014, Stibig <em>et al</em>. 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000–2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (national parks and protected forests; Rode-Margano <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in Kalimantan specifically, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985 to 2001 (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004). Lowland deforestation&#160;is now also a growing threat to populations in mainland South-east Asia (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2015). Choudhury (1997) noted that large-scale deforestation in Indian portions of the species’s range could be contributing to its increased rarity, because many former records come from areas where forests are now being degraded. In China, rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether (Pu <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Throughout South-east Asia, Binturong is hunted for its meat, for traditional medicines and as pets (Corlett 2007, Roberton 2007, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shepherd 2008, Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Philippines, this species is harvested for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is among the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R.J. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There is a large demand for civet meat, including Binturong, in China and Viet Nam (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004, Roberton 2007).<br/><br/>Recent camera-trapping evidence across the species’s range has made clear that the Binturong descends to the ground more frequently than had previously been thought; therefore, the threat of snaring to this species is likely to be more serious than had been assumed. Non-specific hunting of large mammals is very high across most of the species's mainland range, with industrial level cable-snaring especially prevalent in parts of northern South-east Asia. Given that the Binturong is relatively unafraid of people and is sometimes active during the day, it is often conspicuous both to surveyors (suggesting that the few encounters reflect a low population) and to hunters (thus exposing it to elevated risk) (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999); this is supported by verbal reports from wildlife hunters in North-east India (see Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). A number of national-, landscape- and survey-area-level reviews of small carnivore records in mainland South-east Asia have found Binturong to be infrequently recorded, and sometimes not at all, in relatively intensive camera-trap surveys (i.e. more than 1,000 effective camera-trap-nights) (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014; Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3). Although the species’s arboreality may in part explain the paucity of records, the large number of camera-trap&#160;surveys, some of which were targeted at species found in similar habitats e.g. Mainland Clouded Leopard <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>, and the hunting-pressures in this region that have caused the declines in a large range of animal species, suggests that the current infrequency of Binturong records from the mainland South-east Asia portion of its range may be a genuine indication of its rarity there and that this reflects recent decline.","Historically, the Binturong was often thought to be relatively common within its distribution range, but it is now mostly uncommon or rare, and is likely to be approaching national extinction in some range countries in mainland South-east Asia (including Viet Nam) and in China. Lekagul and McNeely (1977) stated that it was rare in Thailand, although Nettelbeck (1997) observed it frequently in a small and intensively watched part of Khao Yai National Park. In Lao PDR, there were only three sightings in the extensive wildlife surveys into some of the remotest parts of the country between 1992 and 1999 (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although the species is mostly arboreal, it is detectable using camera-traps, and relatively intensive post-1999 field surveys that have used this method in suitable habitat in protected areas have produced few or no records of this species in Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em> 2009, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a) and Viet Nam (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3), indicating apparently severe declines in these countries. There are very few camera-trap records from Cambodia, although live animals are relatively frequently confiscated from the wildlife trade there (N. Marx per J. Holden pers. comm. 2015). Thailand might be expected to hold one of the healthiest populations in mainland South-east Asia, but declines are suspected there as well (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Myanmar, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) confirmed camera-trap records from six survey areas (from Kachin state in the north to Tenasserim in the south), and the species has since been detected in most of the few recent (post-2013) camera-trap surveys in the country, with records from Karen state, Tanintharyi division, and from Tamanthi Wildlife Reserve in Sagaing division (WCS, NWCD, KWCI unpublished data per T.N.E. Gray 2015), suggesting that it might rival Thailand as a core country for the species’s conservation in mainland South-east Asia. There are very few records from Bangladesh, but a camera-trap photograph of an adult with young from the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Chakma 2015), suggests that there is a breeding population at least at this site. In North-east India, it is becoming rarer because of habitat loss, because it seems to prefer mature forest, and is mostly restricted to protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Medhalya, Nagaland, Tirupura and Sikkim (Choudhury 2013). It is approaching national extinction in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Binturong was detected by camera-traps in forest surveys across Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, including logged areas, but where logging activities were recent, detections were fewer than in both adjacent primary forest and older logged forest, suggesting a decline in population in logged areas, at least initially (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald, unpublished data). In Sumatra (Indonesia), the species is probably still widespread in the remaining lowlands in Aceh province and upland forests throughout Sumatra; it is relatively frequently observed and camera-trapped in the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra, up to 1,000 m a.s.l. (G. Fredriksson unpublished data 2015). Binturong is thought to be relatively common in Kerinci, West Sumatra (Holden 2006, J. Holden pers. comm. 2015). The bones of a Binturong were collected from a snare-trap set for Serow <em>Capricornis&#160;sumatrensis</em>&#160;at 2,500 m a.s.l. in Kerinci, West Sumatra (Holden 2006).&#160;In the Philippines, the species is localized and uncommon (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998): populations are thought to be decreasing as a result of collection for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"The Binturong is widespread in South and South-east Asia occurring from eastern Nepal, Bangladesh, north-east India and southern China through mainland and island South-east Asia, south-east to Java (Indonesia) and occurring also on the Philippine islands of&#160;Calauit and Palawan (Corbet and Hill 1992, Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998, Choudhury 2013). In North-east India it is known from all the states, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, West Bengal (northern parts), Sikkim and Tripura, being widespread in several of them (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species has been camera-trapped in Royal Manas National Park, Bhutan (Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2011), and is predicted to be present in other southern parts of Bhutan, where suitable habitat remains largely intact (A. U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2015). In Bangladesh there are confirmed sightings from the north-east (Tania Khan per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015), the Chittagong Hill Tracts were it has been camera-trapped (Chakma 2015), and in Cox’s Bazar district, south-east Bangladesh, where an animal was photographed (Sayam Chowdhury per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). Eastern Nepal represents the known western limit of the species’s geographic range, although no recent confirmed records could be traced (Sanjan Thapa pers. comm. 2015, Yadav Ghimirey pers. comm. 2015); but recent suitable survey in this part of the country has been very limited and the species is considered likely&#160;to persist there. It occurred, at least formerly, in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces of southern China, but there are few recent records, none outside Yunnan (Wang 2003, Lau<em> et al</em>. 2010, C. Huang pers. comm. 2015). It potentially occurred historically in Singapore although there are no known records from the country (Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no confirmed records from Brunei, but this is likely to be because of poor survey effort and not because of any ecological factors (Semiadi <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/><br/>It occurs from sea level up to 3,000 m a.s.l., although it is thought to live at higher densities in lowland forest habitats (i.e. below 1,000 m) (see the Habitats and Ecology section, below)","In the Philippines this species is caught for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is one of most frequently displayed caged live carnivores (e.g. five displayed in Pakxe market place during 2013; T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). In addition, skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Many of the animals traded are young (I. Johnson pers. comm.&#160;to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm.&#160;to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). In Viet Nam, there are a few recent records of this species kept as pets or display animals in hotels (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2015), and the species is also traded for Viet Nam’s wildlife meat and traditional medicine markets, for which a wide range of animal species are hunted (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). Binturong meat is valued locally in Arunachal Pradesh, North-east India (Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008; Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). Civets (Viverridae), including Binturongs, are traded their meat for across Peninsular Malaysia (Shepherd and Shepherd 2010). In Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and the hill districts of Assam in India, it is hunted opportunistically and its meat is taken for subsistence use&#160;(A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2015). In Indonesia, when ‘kopi luwak’ ('civet coffee') became a popular product among coffee makers and consumers, several local ‘luwak farmers’ in Lampung, Sumatra, were observed using captive Binturongs and Common Palm Civets <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em> to produce this coffee (G. Semiadi and Wirdateti unpublished data 2014). In early 2013 when the ‘civet lovers’ hobby in Indonesia emerged, Binturongs were traded, although the number of this species in collections is thought to be low. Several Binturongs were seen for sale for the exotic pet trade in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, in 2014 (G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015).",Terrestrial,"Stricter enforcement of legislation against poaching, wildlife trade, habitat degradation and deforestation is required to conserve Binturong. In India it has been on CITES Appendix III since 1989 (CITES 2015). It has also been listed under Schedule I of The Wild Life (Protection) Act of India; this gives the highest conservation status to any species. In Borneo, it is included on Schedule 2 of Sabah’s Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997, under which hunting and collection is allowed with appropriate license issued by the Sabah Wildlife Department, on Part II of the First Schedule of the Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998, and on Indonesia’s Government Regulation No 7. In Brunei, however, the Binturong is not legally protected. In Bangladesh it has complete protection under wildlife protection law of 2012. It is protected in Malaysia, Thailand (under WARPA 2003), and in Viet Nam (Appendix 1B; Decree 32/2006). In the Philippines, the Environmental Legal Assistance Center has been involved in controlling and enforcing wildlife laws. The&#160;species&#160;is listed as Critically Endangered on the China Red List.<br/><br/>Binturong occurs in many protected areas spread across its current range; however, the effectiveness of these reserves at protecting this species is highly variable: it has not been targeted as a conservation focus, or indeed even surveyed for, in many protected areas, and most of the confirmed records are from general surveys or by-catch from surveys aimed at other species. Detailed radio-tracking studies, combined with watching to pay particular attention to ground-level use, would aid,&#160;greatly, understanding of this species’s ecology and therefore (i) a far more confident assessment of whether the lack of camera-trap records from some areas is a genuine reflection of decline/absence, and not of ineffective camera-trap placement, and (ii) more effectively targeted conservation.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45217835,41693,Paradoxurus hermaphroditus,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Common Palm Civet is listed as Least Concern because it has a wide distribution, large populations, uses a broad range of habitats and&#160;is tolerant of extensive habitat degradation and change, and is evidently resilient to 'background' hunting levels. These attributes mean that it is unlikely to be declining at the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. With a recent upsurge in off-take over a significant part of its range, this categorisation warrants review when better data on the effects of this off-take become available.","Common Palm Civet uses a wide range of habitats including evergreen and deciduous forest (primary and secondary), seasonally flooded <em>Melaleuca</em>-dominated peat swamp forest, mangroves (Bangladesh Sundarbans), monoculture plantations (such as oil palm and teak), village and urban environments (Ratnam <em>et al</em>.&#160;1995, Heydon and Bulloh 1996, Duckworth 1997, Azlan 2003,&#160;Esselstyn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004,&#160;Heaney <em>et al</em>. 2004, Su Su 2005, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005, Belden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Maddox <em>et al</em>. 2007, Mudappa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Roberton 2007,&#160;Khan 2008,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Holden and Neang 2009, Wilting&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Low 2011, Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Samejima and Semiadi 2012,&#160;Choudhury 2013, Hedges&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Nakashima&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Wahyudi and Stuebing 2013,&#160;Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Kakati and Srikant 2014,&#160;Rode-Margono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Nakabayashi&#160;<em>et al</em>. in prep., D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). In a&#160;survey of two oil palm plantations in central&#160;Sumatra (where it was the only civet recorded), it was common even in their interior (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Radio-tracking studies have revealed home-ranges of up to 17 km² for males and 1.6 km² for females (Dhungle and Edge 1985, Rabinowitz 1991, Joshi <em>et al</em>. 1995, Grassman 1998). <br/><br/>This species is adapted for forest living, yet it tolerates living in areas near people: commuting along wires and pipes, sleeping in barns, drains, or roofs during the day, and coming out at night to catch rats or forage for mango, coffee, pineapples, melons, and bananas; it also eats insects and molluscs (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Spaan <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is&#160;crepuscular or nocturnal (e.g., Duckworth 1997,&#160;Azlan 2005). It is&#160;partly arboreal (Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1985) and&#160;the extent of arboreal activity perhaps varies across its range or between habitats: it is often among the most commonly photographed small carnivores by ground-level camera-traps, yet extensive camera-trapping in an oil-palm plantation in East Kalimantan did not record it at all, until camera-traps were placed up trees, when it was found to be common (Wahyudi and Stuebing 2013).","Common Palm Civet is hunted (often a part of general take, using non-selective methods) for wild meat in some parts of its range, such as southern China,&#160;parts of North-east India (especially in Nagaland and hilly areas of Manipur),&#160;Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Thailand and probably throughout northern South-east Asia and widely elsewhere in its range (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Dead individuals of this species were found with local tribes during a visit to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and Agra, Uttar Pradesh in India between 1998 and 2003, where it is killed for its meat (Gupta 2004).&#160;Hunting in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India, has apparently much declined (Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), and this&#160;is&#160;probably typical for India excepting the North-east. It is commonly sold in Javan,&#160;and to a lesser extent Philippine,&#160;markets for the pet trade (Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;It is also persecuted as a pest (e.g., Gupta 2004, Su Su 2005) although it seems able to tolerate very high levels of persecution (e.g. Duckworth 1997). While these pressures are certainly having localised effects on populations in highly fragmented and ‘humanised’ areas,&#160;such as&#160;Houay Nhang (Lao PDR), there is no evidence in mainland South-east Asia of them significantly reducing the population levels in large tracts of natural and semi-natural habitat, even in the heavily hunted countries of Lao PDR and Viet Nam; while in much of India it is a common urban commensal (e.g. Gupta 2004). There has been a recent great&#160;increase in numbers&#160;kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g. Shepherd 2012, Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and to&#160;a lesser extent, in the Philippines (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Large numbers of live Common Palm Civets are traded internationally and when trade confiscations occur, animals are typically released close to site of confiscation. Given that some trade goes from Sundaic South-east Asia to China (e.g. Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;it is highly likely that many individuals of one clade/subspecies/species (see 'Taxonomic notes') are being released within the range of another; this has the risk of hybridisation/introgression, or of competitive exclusion (depending on whether the different forms are reproductively isolated; this remains unknown).","Across its wide range, Common Palm Civet is often one of the most commonly recorded species of small carnivore. Across its range it has been found commonly in degraded and anthropogenic habitats,&#160;with some records from even&#160;the most degraded small isolates amid human environments, such as Houay Nhang in Lao PDR and Hlawga in Myanmar. In North-east India and non-Sundaic South-east Asia&#160;it is common in the remote interiors of large blocks of closed evergreen forest, whereas in mainland India (certainly) and in Sundaic South-east Asia (perhaps) it is rare in in such habitat, while still common in degraded and edge habitats (Duckworth 1997,&#160;Esselstyn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004,&#160;Su Su 2005, Holden 2006, Belden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Mudappa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Roberton 2007,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Holden and Neang 2009, Wilting&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Low 2011, Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Samejima and Semiadi 2012,&#160;Choudhury 2013, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013, Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Nakashima&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Kakati and Srikant 2014,&#160;Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3,&#160;Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, McCarthy and Fuller&#160;2014). In southern China where it is extensively hunted, it is mostly not common, perhaps as a result of decline (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), but these areas (Guangxi and Guangdong) also comprise the edge of its range. The recent rapid rise in production of 'civet coffee', a practice using mainly this species, and a new craze for keeping this species as a 'pet' have both presumably resulted in greatly increased off-take from the wild in Indonesia; there is no meaningful information as to the effects of these recent changes (Shepherd 2012, D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2014, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Civet coffee farms are also expanding rapidly in Viet Nam (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Together with ongoing hunting pressure, particularly in northern South-east Asia, it is likely that the global population is in decline. Given the large areas with only minimal off-take, such declines are at present likely to be very shallow.",Decreasing,"Common Palm Civet has a wide distribution in South and South-east Asia from Afghanistan in the west to Hainan and the adjacent Chinese coast in the east; it occurs widely on&#160;South-east Asian islands, but&#160;the natural pattern of occurrence there is uncertain, given the evidence of introduction by people&#160;(Patou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Stevens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Animals in Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas eastwards appear to be introductions, while the Philippine archipelago might have been colonised naturally but also might stem entirely from introductions (Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Its recorded distribution in China is restricted, to Hainan,&#160;southern Guangdong (perhaps based on a trade animal),&#160;south-western Guangxi, much of Yunnan and south-western Sichuan provinces (Wang 2003, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It occurs on the small islands of Bawean (Indonesia), Con Son (Viet Nam), Koh Samui (Thailand), Koh Yao (Thailand), and Telebon (Thailand) (Meiri 2005), and on the Philippine islands of Balabac, Busuanga, Camiguin, Culion, Leyte, Luzon, Marinduque, Mindanao, Negros, Palawan, Sangasanga, Sibuyan (specimens) and Catanduanes, Biliran, Maripipi and Panay (other indications) (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998). It is sometimes stated to have been introduced to Japan, but this reflects confusion with Masked Palm Civet <em>Paguma larvata</em> (S. Roy <em>in litt</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>It occurs widely at sea-level; the highest records globally are perhaps those at 2,400 m in North-east India (Choudhury 2013) and in Afghanistan at 2,500 m (Stevens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).","Common Palm Civet is a large part of the general mammal harvest for eating in South-east Asia, both for subsistence but also for trade to urban luxury restaurants. It is increasingly kept as a 'pet' and kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g., Shepherd 2012, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Terrestrial,"Common Palm Civet is found within many protected areas across its range (e.g. Lao PDR&#160;–&#160;Duckworth 1997; Viet Nam – Roberton 2007, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3; Cambodia – Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014; Myanmar – Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008; Thailand&#160;–&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014; Singapore&#160;–&#160;Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012; China&#160;–&#160;Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010; North-east India&#160;–&#160;Choudhury 2013; Borneo&#160;–&#160;Nakabayashi <em>et al</em>. in prep.; Java&#160;–&#160;Rode-Margono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This species is listed on CITES Appendix III (India).&#160;It&#160;is protected in Malaysia (Azlan pers. comm. 2006), India (on Schedule II part II of the Wildlife Protection Act (2004)), Sichuan, China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2000), Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008) and Bangladesh (under the Wildlife Act 2012; Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), but not in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is listed as Vulnerable on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004). Its adaptability to modified habitats (including towns and cities) and resilience in the face of heavy general hunting means that at present no conservation interventions are needed. However, the effects of the recent rapid rise in targeted off-take, for civet coffee and the pet trade, in parts of its range (notably Indonesia) are unknown; surveillance of trade levels and investigation of effects on wild populations are warranted (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
46173447,41588,Vulpes zerda,Least Concern,,2015,2015-07-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern as the species is relatively widespread in the sandy deserts and semi-deserts of northern Africa to northern Sinai, and there currently are no known major range-wide threats believed to be resulting in a population decline that would warrant listing in a threatened category.","Fennec Foxes subsist in arid desert environments and are capable of inhabiting the remotest sand seas. Stable sand dunes are believed to be ideal habitat (Dorst and Dandelot 1970, Coetzee 1977), although they also live in very sparsely vegetated sand dunes near the Atlantic coast (F. Cuzin pers. obs.). Annual rainfall is less than 100 mm per year on the northern fringe of their distribution. On the southern fringe, it may be found up to the Sahelian areas that receive as much as 300 mm rainfall per year. In the Sahara, Fennecs occur in vast treeless sand seas with sparse vegetation often dominated by <em>Aristida </em>spp. and <em>Cyperus </em>spp., with shrubs such as <em>Ephedra alata</em>&#160;or (in the central Sahara) <em>Cornulaca monacantha</em>. Typically they are the only canid in large sand dune habitats. In small sand dunes or fixed vegetated dunes, Fennecs typically occur in areas dominated by <em>Panicum turgidum</em>&#160;or <em>Zygophyllum</em> spp., and sometimes by trees like <em>Acacia </em>spp. and <em>Capparis decidua</em> (Asa and Cuzin 2013) and they may share these habitats with Rueppell’s Fox and Golden Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>.&#160;Studies at Termit in Niger suggested that although sympatric with other canids, they appeared tolerant of a wide range of habitats, including, but not limited to, drier and higher temperature zones than other species (Burruss 2014); ability to burrow in sandier substrates than other canids may also provide Fennecs with a competitive advantage in dune systems (Cuzin and Lenain 2004).","Currently there are no major range-wide threats to the species. However, human activity is rising rapidly in many parts of the Sahara. Construction of new roads, bettering of non-asphalted roads and new human settlements increase the disturbance and risk to some populations. Ongoing seismic surveys, exploratory drilling and oil field developments, coupled with increasing development of commercial transport and migration routes across recently remote parts of the region, create further pressure. The impact of major oil field development on local populations has not been assessed. Direct impacts include increased risk of ‘roadkills’ and risk to naïve desert living Fennecs, which can show lack of fear and curiosity when approached by vehicles. Locally, in North Africa, the main threat appears to be trapping for exhibition or sale to tourists. Though restricted to marginal areas, new permanent human settlements such as those in southern Morocco have resulted in the disappearance of foxes in these areas (F. Cuzin pers. obs.).","They are common throughout the Sahara (Harrison and Bates 1991). The only documented regression concerns northern Moroccan Sahara, where the species disappeared during the 1960s from four localities, which were restricted sandy areas close to permanent human settlements (Asa and Cuzin 2013). Otherwise,&#160;the population is assumed to be adequate based on the observations that the Fennec is still commonly trapped and sold commercially in North Africa and was regularly encountered during field work in desert areas of Chad and Niger during 2010 and 2015. In southern Morocco, they are commonly seen in all sandy areas away from permanent human settlements (Asa and Cuzin 2013).&#160;In extensive opportunistic camera trapping studies across central Chad, Fennecs were the most frequently recorded species, present at 32 out of 94 widespread camera trapping locations north of 14.5°N ,with none recorded at 30 localities south of this line (M. Hassan, T. Wacher and J. Newby pers. comm. 2015)",Stable,"This species is widespread in the sandy deserts and semi-deserts of northern Africa, ranging from Western Sahara and Mauritania to northern Sinai (Asa <em>et al</em>. 2004, Asa and Cuzin 2013); it may occur south to around 14°N (Dragesco-Joffé 1993, Granjon <em>et al</em>. 1995). The species' expected range has been modelled from combined topographical-climatic and habitat variables (Brito <em>et al</em>. 2009). The occurrence of this species in the Arabian Peninsula (not mapped here) is unclear because of confusion with locally used names, and with the pale and large-eared young of the Arabian subspecies of Ruppell’s Fox, <em>V. rueppellii sabaea</em>&#160;(T. Wacher pers. obs). In these circumstances, records dependent on tracks (e.g., Thesiger 1949) are doubtful. There is a specimen from Kuwait in the Natural History Museum in London (Harrison and Bates 1991), though it is uncertain if this individual was collected from the wild. Another specimen was recorded from southern Iraq (Al-Robaae 1982), a short distance to the north. Mallon and Budd (2011) reported the results of interviews by Salah Behbehani that local communities in Kuwait had observed a species known under the local name ‘hosni fennec’, and that people used to catch them for the tails which were hung in their cars; they also referred to reported sightings and photographs (not yet published or reviewed) of the species from northwest Saudi Arabia, close to the documented range in Sinai, but in habitat more typical of Blanford’s Fox <em>V. cana</em>. References to sightings of Fennec Fox in the United Arab Emirates were based on an animal in the Al Ain zoo (Al-Robbae 1982), which was, in fact, a Rüppell's Fox (Gasperetti <em>et al</em>. 1985).","In Morocco and Tunisia, and presumably elsewhere, young foxes are sometimes captured for sale to tourists and for photographic exhibition; adults are sometimes taken for their fur (Asa and Cuzin 2013, B. d'Amicis pers. comm. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legal protection</strong><br/>It is listed in CITES – Appendix II.

As of June 2014, there were 156 individuals in 42 AZA institutions (Knobbe 2014), and 130 in 50 EAZA institutions (Mekarska 2014), both in actively managed programmes. Although there is no studbook or formal species management programme for Fennecs in Australian zoos, there are 16 individuals living in five zoos managed by the ZAA, all of which descend from the AZA or EAZA populations. Fennecs are kept in private collections within the Middle East and are also bred privately in the United States where they are sometimes kept as pets, but these records are not available.&#160;<br/><br/>Since 2001, Fennec Fox populations have been managed in zoos for the purposes of captive breeding, research and education (Bauman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Bauman 2010, Van der Meer 2011). Captive populations are managed using genetic and demographic goals so that they are as self sustaining as possible. Research projects with Fennec Fox are varied; some are specific to the species itself since there is a dearth of data and Fennec Fox husbandry has been challenging, whereas other projects utilize the Fennec as a model for other foxes (Bauman <em>et al</em>. 2010). Basic work on nutrition (Dempsey <em>et al</em>. 2009) and disease (K. Ross, K. Bauman, A. Moresco, D. Agnew and C. Asa pers. comm. 2015) and husbandry (Mekarska 2006) has been completed. Genetic work, assessing the relatedness within the AZA and EAZA populations, using mtDNA haplotypes (blood) and microsatellites (blood and hair), also have been recently completed (J.A. Ivy, K. Bauman and C. Lynch, pers. comm. 2015, A. Mekarska pers. comm. 2015). In-depth studies of reproduction in Fennecs (Asa and Valdespino 1998,&#160;Asa and Valdespino&#160;2003, Asa <em>et al</em>. 2014, Valdespino <em>et al</em>. 2002) continue, along with new initiatives to documenting circadian rhythms using remote activity monitors, validation of a glucocorticoid assay, and the development of personality assessment tools. Many of these projects were recommended action items from the 2010 International Fox Husbandry Workshop. These projects have contributed greatly to our knowledge of Fennec Fox, but also help develop and validate techniques for use in other species such as the Darwin’s Fox, where there is interest in potentially setting up captive breeding facilities within Chile (K. Bauman, pers. obs.). Finally, in AZA, one-third of the Fennec Fox population are dedicated to educational roles. Fennec Foxes are charismatic and one of the few carnivore species available for this purpose. Zoo-based education programmes for Fennecs are varied, but include: 1) discussions about canid biology and ecology, 2) discussions about the differences between wolves, dogs and foxes, and 3) talking about desert adaptations and ecosystems.&#160;<br/><br/>There is tremendous opportunity for future work with Fennecs to be integrated along a continuum of <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> strategies under the emerging One Plan approach, a method of metapopulation management developed by International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (Byers <em>et al</em>. 2013). This would facilitate discussion on all the various strategies and tools that could be utilized by&#160;<em>in situ</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>ex situ&#160;</em>managers, and provide opportunities for joint decisions and complimentary actions, thus making species-based conservation more effective and efficient.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Gaps in knowledge</strong><br/>While studies of captive Fennec Fox have gone some way towards improving our knowledge of this little-known species, there is still a paucity of data regarding their basic ecology and behaviour in the wild. Thus, in 2009 the Saint Louis Zoo (USA) initiated a carnivore project in Niger to study Fennec Fox, Pale Fox <em>Vulpes pallida</em>&#160;and Ruppell’s Fox <em>Vulpes rueppellii</em>, as well as several other sympatric carnivores. Zoos from AZA and EAZA worked with the IUCN Canid Specialist Group, University of Oxford WildCRU, and the Sahara Conservation Fund on this first ever Fennec Fox field project; an excellent example of how zoos can directly fund and contribute to <em>in situ</em> efforts. &#160;Nonetheless, much remains unknown of the basic ecology and behaviour in the wild of Fennecs. The study in Niger was an important first step, yet further work is needed, and research on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild is overdue. No data are available regarding the impact from the increasing human presence within the Fennec range, and this should at minimum be monitored, but ideally future ecological studies should be designed such that data are collected from disturbed and non-disturbed sites to provide more information about human impacts.&#160;<br/><br/>A new study initiated in southern Morocco (formerly Western Sahara) in 2015, mainly targeted at <em>Felis margarita</em>, but investigating the whole guild of small carnivores (including the Fennec Fox) should contribute to further understanding of habitat use by Fennec Fox, movement patterns and interactions with other small carnivores (F. Cuzin pers. obs.).&#160;The recent deployment of a pilot long term camera trap study in north-western Saudi Arabia, coupled with follow up museum visits to establish the background of the two implicated museum specimens, should help resolve uncertainty about the status of Fennec in Arabian peninsula area (T.

Grey Fox are also increasingly common in urban environments. Available evidence suggests that Grey Fox numbers are probably stable across their range, and not subject to any range-wide threats causing marked declines in the overall population size despite being trapped for their pelts in many parts of their range. Available evidence suggests they are frequently incidentally captured when other more highly sought furbearers (e.g., Bobcat) are targeted.","In eastern North America, the Grey Fox is most closely associated with deciduous/southern pine forests interspersed with some old fields and scrubby woodlands (Hall 1981). In western North America, it is commonly found in mixed agricultural/woodland/chaparral/riparian landscapes and shrub habitats. The species occupies forested areas and thick brush habitats in Central America and forested montane habitats in South America (Eisenberg 1989). Grey Foxes occur in semi-arid areas of the south-western USA and northern Mexico where cover is sufficient. They appear to do well both within and on the margins of some urban areas (Harrison 1997, Castellanos <em>et al</em>. 2008).","There are no major range-wide threats to the species, but extreme habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation may be problematic in regions where human habitation is increasing rapidly and habitat is converted for agricultural, industrial, and urban uses. However, they are overall relatively adaptable and have become increasingly common even in urban environments. Grey foxes have been involved in some large die-offs due to canine distemper virus in parts of their range, and may also be affected by canine parvovirus and rabies.","The species is generally common, but appears to be restricted to locally dense habitats where it is not excluded by sympatric Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) and Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>) (Farias 2000b).",Stable,"The Grey Fox ranges widely from the southern edge of central and eastern Canada, and Oregon, Nevada, Utah and Colorado in the United States south to northern Venezuela and Colombia; and from the Pacific coast of the United States to the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans. The species is not found in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, or in the Caribbean watersheds of Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and western Panama (Fritzell and Haroldson 1982, Fuller and Cypher 2004). They have expanded their range in recent decades into habitats and areas either formerly unoccupied or from which they were extirpated.","Because of its relatively lower fur quality compared with other species, commercial use of the Grey Fox is somewhat limited. However, 90,604 skins were recorded taken in the United States during the 1991 and 1992 season (Linscombe 1994). In Mexico, Grey Foxes are frequently sold illegally as pets (Fuller and Cypher 2004).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in the CITES Appendices.

Grey Foxes appear to fare well in captivity and commonly are on display at zoos and wildlife farms.<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge</strong><br/>Because of the relatively high abundance and low economic value of Grey Foxes, surprisingly little research has been conducted on this species. Basic ecological and demographic information is needed for each of the major habitats occupied by Grey Foxes, and there remains limited information available on the impacts of disease (such as canine distemper and canine parvovirus) in most parts of the range, although ongoing work in north-western Mexico will provide new and important information (R. List pers. comm. 2015). Also, additional research on the response of Grey Foxes to human-altered landscapes (e.g., urban environments) is needed. In general, extremely little is known about the status and ecology of Grey Foxes outside of the USA and Canada.

Population densities were estimated in south east Sulawesi where estimates range from 1.1-1.6 animals/km²<sup></sup> but with wide confidence limits (Mustari 2003, Burton <em>et al.</em> 2005) and Buton where density was estimated at 1.1 animals/km² (Wheeler 2004). Further estimates are as low as 0.07 animals/km²<sup></sup> in north Sulawesi (O’Brien and Kinnaird 1996) and as high as 2.4 animals/km²<sup></sup> from south east Sulawesi (Mustari 1995). On Buton island, Anoas appeared to use forests independent of their primary or secondary nature, the primary determinant of use being human activity in the forest (Dwiyahreni 2006, Wheeler <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Lore Lindu National Park, central Sulawesi track counts were highest in higher altitude areas away from the park’s fringes (Burton and MacDonald 2009, Okarda 2010). Riverine and lowland forests were preferred by Anoa compared to rocky-cliff forest in Tanjung Peropa Wildlife Reserve due to the availability of water sources, known food plants and fruit-bearing trees (Mustari 2003). In the past the species was reportedly common along coasts. Lowland Anoa are also found at high elevations in mountainous areas. Like other wild buffalo, Anoas wallow and bathe in pools of water and/or mud. It is probable that mineral springs or licks are also required, although Anoas are reported to drink seawater, which might fulfil their mineral needs in areas without licks or springs.<br/> <br/> The species is solitary though pairs of adults are occasionally encountered, presumably associated with breeding activity.

There have been declines of this species throughout Sulawesi, especially in the southern and northeastern peninsulas, with the decline attributed to hunting for meat and habitat loss (Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, 2013, Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). The range is extremely fragmented, especially in the southern, northeastern and the south of the southeastern peninsulas of the island (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005, B. Mannullang pers. comm. 2006). These declines probably began at the turn of the nineteenth century, with an increased rate of decline between 1980 and 2005 period (<em>circa</em> three generations), precipitously in some areas. The population size is unknown because there have been no island-wide or regional surveys which have attempted to estimate this, even for the largest populations. Estimating the population size is further complicated by the uncertain distribution of the two Anoa species. It is thought that there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. Most populations are becoming rapidly fragmented; suggesting that conservation of viable populations may soon require management of subpopulations (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). It is thought no subpopulation exceeds 250 mature individuals. Since the Lowland Anoa inhabits more accessible areas than the Mountain Anoa, the threats to this species, and thus the declines, are considered more serious for this species than for the Mountain Anoa.<br/> <br/> The Lowland Anoa populations in small reserves (e.g., Tanjung Amolengu Wildlife Reserve) and other forest fragments are threatened with local extinction. Even the populations in large protected areas and other large forest blocks are reported to be in decline as a result of heavy hunting pressure. O'Brien and Kinnaird (1996) report a 50 to 95% decline of this species in Tangkoko Nature Reserve in Northern Sulawesi in a 10-year period, with more recent surveys suggesting it is now locally extinct in in the reserve. The rate of population decline across their range is thought to be 20% over two generations (generation length of 7 to 9 years). The species’ ecology has been studied in the Tanjung Peropa and Tanjung Amolengo Wildlife Reserves in southeastern Sulawesi.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is endemic to Indonesia, where it is found only on Sulawesi and Buton Island off the southeast coast, with no records of either species of Anoas from other small neighbouring islands adjacent to Sulawesi (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005).

Across Sulawesi, local distribution of Anoa species remains unclear, as they may occur in forest patches at different altitudes or sympatrically (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Records of skulls and morphological descriptions of this species suggest it is present in the northern peninsula, as far east as the Bogani Nani-Wartabone National Park.

In 2013 the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry published a Strategy and Conservation Action Plan for Anoa 2013-2022. The vision of this plan is 'a stable population of Anoa in its wild habitat through reduced poaching (hunting) and illegal trade, maintenance of the existing habitat, through active involvement of the stakeholders'. A series of high priority sites for <em>in situ</em> conservation of Anoa have been identified: 11 in mainland Sulawesi, and two in Buton (Indonesian Ministry of Forestry 2013). These sites were selected based on a) representation of known subpopulations, extent of forest cover and connectivity between forested areas and status of management of area (whether sites were national parks, protected forests, restoration concessions). The plan also identifies protection from hunting, prevention of habitat loss, determining population status, education and training, and developing partnerships as important areas for future activities.

Consequently it qualifies as Endangered under criterion A2bcd. The status of this species varies in different parts of its range, but overall this decline is expected to continue in the future.","<p>This species is found in high-altitude cedar and oak forests, coastal scrub, and overgrazed rocky slopes with vestigial vegetation. It is confined to inaccessible rocky areas, gorges, and montane areas (from sea level up to approximately 2,600 m asl) due to habitat use conflicts with humans in more favourable areas. All the areas occupied by the Barbary Macaque are under growing pressure from human activity and habitat availability for <em>M. sylvanus</em> has decreased markedly in recent decades (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). <br/><br/>In Algeria, occupied habitats include mixed cedar (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>) and oak forests; Humid Zen Oak (<em>Quercus canariensis</em>) and Cork Oak (<em>Quercus suber</em>) mixes; Algerian Fir (<em>Abies numidica</em>), cedar and Zen Oak mixed forests; and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Taub 1977b, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Moroccan habitats include high cedar forests (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>), cedar/Holm Oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>) mixtures, mixed oak forests (Qu<em>ercus suber, Q. canariensis, Q. ilex </em>and<em> Q. pyrenaica</em>) and cliffs and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Waters 2013). In habitats with cedar, macaques can reach densities of 25–40 individuals per km² or greater, whereas in habitats without cedar much lower densities of 5–7 individuals per km² are reported (Fa 1984). Densities in the mixed oak forests of Bouhachem Natural Reserve appear to be much higher than previously reported for the region (Waters unpublished data). In all occupied habitats, there is a species of oak available.<br/><br/>In Algeria, <em>M. sylvanus</em> lives in mixed-sex groups of up to 80 individuals with a modal size of 40 individuals (Ménard 2002). In Morocco, in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve, group size of four study groups was 52–73 with a mean of 62 (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Middle Atlas Mountains, group size ranged between 14 and 54 animals with a mean of 25 (Majolo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Life span in the wild is known to be up to 22 years (Lindenfors 2002). Females reach sexual maturity between 3.5 and 4 years of age and males between 4.5 and 7 years of age. In the wild, average age at first birth is 5.3 years for females (Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996; Lindenfors 2002) and the interbirth interval is 1.3 years (Taub 1974 in Fa 1984, Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996).</p>","<p>The destruction and degradation of the Barbary Macaque’s forest habitat is the most serious threat to the species. The severity of different threats varies in different parts of the species' range. <br/><br/>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation have been caused by domestic and industrial consumption of wood, use of fire, clearing for cultivation and overgrazing by sheep and goat herds (Taub 1977a, Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Ménard and Vallet 1993). This is exacerbated by poor forestry management; often <em>Cedrus atlanticus</em> is favoured and efforts are made to reduce <em>Quercus ilex</em>, but the latter species is a crucial resource for Barbary Macaques in some areas of their distribution (Ménard and Vallet 1986, 1996). In Morocco, severe habitat loss is also caused by extensive logging of cedar trees, occurring within and outside national parks (B. Majolo pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>As well as habitat degradation resulting from overgrazing by livestock is a major threat to the species (and a problem which is exacerbated by drought), in recent years, shepherds have increasingly settled near water sources. As shepherd tribes move into the forest, they often enclose open water sources with cement wells to be able to extract water for their herds. As a result, Barbary Macaques and other wildlife have been excluded from water sources in areas where it was previously accessible to them (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Conflicts with local people have been reported in Algeria, as a result of crop-raiding by macaques (e.g., villages in Djurdjura National Park in the Grande-Kabylie region: F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Crop raiding by Barbary Macaques has been reported by farmers in the area of Ouzoud (El Alami and Chait 2014) and other areas of the High Atlas. As a consequence, the shooting of Barbary Macaques as a result of crop raiding and cedar bark stripping was reported by Deag (1977) and must be seen as an ongoing threat to the species’ future.<br/><br/>In Algeria, national park officials indicate that the primary problem faced by Barbary Macaques is the conflict with mountain settlers, agricultural farmers and crop producers. Recently, regulation of forest use and access in Algeria has changed and it is now easier for people to use the forest areas. During the 1980s and 1990s, Algerians faced public curfews and restricted access to mountainous/forested regions due to civil war. Until recently, settlers were allowed to return to homes once occupied by their relatives in areas where Barbary Macaques are present. For example, in Chréa National Park, the human population increased from 550–600 individuals in 1993 to over 6,000 in 2015. Growth in human populations has resulted in a rise in infrastructure development in and around these areas, increasing the chances of macaque and human interaction through crop raiding, feeding interactions, as well as vehicle accidents (Benrabah 2015). Development of infrastructure has been shown to negatively impact wild macaques. For example, between 2008 and 2015, 31 incidents were recorded by park officials in Chréa National Park, including vehicle-related deaths of macaques (12 incidents) and 11 attempts of illegal capture of wild monkeys (Benrabah 2015). <br/><br/>The illegal live primate trade is also a significant threat to Barbary Macaques, as is their exploitation as photo props in tourist areas. Reports of capture for the international pet trade date back to 1977 (Deag 1977), and since then the trade has increased markedly (van Lavieren 2004). The Barbary Macaque was the most commonly confiscated mammal recorded by breeding programmes in European zoos between 2006–2010 (Zimmerman 2011). Infant <em>M. sylvanus</em> are offered both openly and covertly for sale on markets across Morocco, and prices of up to 200 Euros per animal have been recorded (van Lavieren 2004). Prices of about 100 Euros per animal have been recorded in Algeria, with Chaabet-el-Akhra gorges (Béjaïa) and Yakouren (Akfadou) cited as critical locations where illegal trade occur (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional threats include persecution, predation by dogs (Waters 2014), unmanaged primate tourism (Marechal <em>et al</em>. 2011, Borg <em>et al</em>. 2014), and pollution of the wadis (rivers) associated with forests (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Barbary Macaques seem to be rarely used for food, except as noted in some old reports in Algeria (Deag 1977).</p>","<p>In 1975, the Moroccan population of Barbary Macaques was estimated to be about 17,000 (Taub 1975). In Algeria, the population was estimated at 5,500 animals around 40 years ago (Taub 1977a). Alhough Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the species at around 15,000 individuals in 1999, this estimate was based on incomplete data.<br/><br/>Two population surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 at 23 locations in Algeria estimated the Algerian population to be 1,336–3,506 animals (Benrabah 2015, Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), representing an average population decrease of 50% in comparison to the last published survey (Fa 1984). Algerian subpopulations are highly fragmented (Fa 1984, Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). In 1999, just seven widely separated isolated populations existed, whereas 35 years ago they were found in at least six additional locations in Algeria (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently, in Algeria there is a remaining isolated population in Gorge Chiffa and the Park National of Chrea (131–352 individuals) (Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). The populations of Djurdjura, Tikjda, Akhfasou, Bejaia, Gouraya, Yakouoren, Kherrata, Draguina, Taza, Ait Alouane, Guerrouch and el Babor are fragmented.<br/><br/>In Morocco, a number of surveys have documented marked declines in population density, along with losses of a number of sites (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999, Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). Fourteen isolated populations were identified in the High Atlas (Cuzin 2003). A recent survey in the Central High Atlas Mountains reported direct observations of 644 individuals in 23 groups with a mean group size of 21 individuals. However, irregular surveys over a long period may have resulted in an overestimate of the population (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The cedar forest area of the central Middle Atlas represents the largest refuge of the North African forest ecosystem. In the 1980s, it was estimated that 65–75% of the world's remaining population of <em>Macaca sylvanus</em> lived in this area (Camperio Ciani 1986). In the mid-1970s, population densities in the central Middle Atlas cedar forest were variously estimated at 60–70 individuals per km² (Deag 1974) or 43 per km² (Taub 1975). The most recent population estimate for the Middle Atlas is 5,000 macaques with densities of up to 23.4 individuals per km² (Menard <em>et al</em> 2013a). These data indicate that, in the central Middle Atlas, average population density is three times less than it was 30 years ago (<em>ca</em> 15,000; Taub 1977). In addition, Menard <em>et al</em>. (2013b) estimated that 46% of immatures were removed from macaque groups habituated for tourism in Ifrane National Park by poachers for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In the Rif Mountains, recent and current surveys are revealing that the populations are not as fragmented and low as previously thought. A recent survey has estimated a population of ~1,500 macaques in contiguous mixed oak forest in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve where there is very little poaching pressure for the pet trade (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Gibraltar, the population is maintained at <em>ca</em> 300 animals but now occurs in more and smaller groups. Some of these groups often range in built-up areas and have caused serious conflict with residents. One such group has been captured and sent to a captive collection in the UK (Waters 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Barbary Macaque is the only surviving primate in Africa north of the Sahara Desert, the only native species of primate to occur in Europe, and the only member of the genus <em>Macaca</em> that can be found outside Asia. In prehistoric times, this species inhabited Southern Europe and all of North Africa (Delson 1980, Camperio Ciani 1986). In historic times, it was widespread throughout North Africa from Libya to Morocco, but its current distribution is limited to small relict patches of forest and scrub in Algeria and Morocco (Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Scheffrahn <em>et al</em>. 1993, Menard and Vallet 1996). A semi-wild population lives in Gibraltar, which is a long established introduced population (Fa 1981, von Starck 1990, Hodges and Cortes 2006).<br/><br/>In Morocco, <em>M. sylvanus</em> is found in the Rif mountains (northern Morocco) and the Middle and High Atlas Mountains (central Morocco). More specifically, in Morocco the High Atlas populations (two anciently separated populations) are found from Demnat to El Ksba (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013) and around the Ourika Valley. In the Rif, Barbary Macaques are found in the protected areas of Bouhacham Natural Reserve, Talessemtane National Park, and Djebel Moussa (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Algeria, the species is found in the Tellian Atlas (Petite Kabylie and Grande Kabylie Mountains, and an isolated population in the Chréa National Park) in the north. From west to east, Barbary Macaque populations in Algeria are distributed as follows: Park National of Chrea (Gorge Chiffa), Park National of Djurdjura (Djurdjura and Tikjda), Park National of Bejaia, and Gouraya, Forests of Akhfadou, Yakouren, Gorges of Kherrata Forests of Draguina, Forests of Toudja, Park National of Taza (Ait Aloaune, Guerrouch and El Babor) (Benrabah, 2015). Additionally, a Barbary Macaque population might still occur in Djebel Bouzegza (Boumerdes, Grande-Kabylie) (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>The species occurs from sea level to 2,600 m asl (Cuzin 2003).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Macaca sylvanus</em> receives protection under national and international legislation, but law enforcement is inadequate. The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In 2000, the European Community suspended imports of <em>M. sylvanus</em> from Algeria and Morocco under the provisions of Article 4.6b of EC Regulation 338/97 because such trade was deemed to have a harmful impact on the species' status.<br/><br/>In both Morocco and Algeria, the national forestry departments are responsible for the management and the protection of flora and fauna. The Moroccan HCEFCLD collaborates with a Barbary Macaque conservation NGO to confiscate illegally-held macaques. The Moroccan NGO, Barbary Macaque Conservation in the Rif (BMCRif), has had success using social media to raise awareness among the Moroccan public who now regularly report illegally-held macaques in the Rif region, which are then confiscated by the forestry authorities (Waters and El Harrad 2013). The wildlife protection law in Morocco has recently been strengthened and confiscations take place more often. Some individuals are then released into the wild if they meet basic criteria. This strategy is successful for animals under one year of age due to the Barbary Macaque’s allo-parenting behaviour (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>With the rise in human presence and economic development in these regions, there may be an increase of fragmentation and separation, further isolating Barbary Macaques populations and preventing migration/dispersal (Benrabah 2015). However, with careful planning, the highly fragmented populations in Algeria could be reconnected via ecological corridors composed of forest patches, gorges, river basins and scrub regions. Ecological corridors are available for migration/dispersal of animals, provided the necessary actions are undertaken to protect those areas to assure they are suitable for the stable presence of macaques.<br/><br/>There has been some success recorded in Morocco with carefully-planned community projects; although crop raiding by Barbary Macaques does occur, community conservation activities are proving adequate to decrease human-macaque conflict in Bouhachem and persecution of the macaques by shepherds has ceased (Waters 2014).<br/><br/>A number of activities have been undertaken to increase public awareness and reduce illegal trade in this species. The Moroccan NGO BMRif collaborates with both regional and national forestry authorities to raise awareness about the Barbary Macaque including its status as a protected species. AAP (a Netherlands-based sanctuary for exotic animals) has initiated a project to combat illegal trade of Barbary Macaques into Europe, involving inter alia awareness raising among potential buyers, cooperation with authorities in consumer countries and training of customs officers in Spain (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006). The NGO Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation has trained local ecoguards whose task is to prevent attempts to capture macaques in Ifrane National Park for the illegal primate trade.<br/><br/>Most Barbary Macaque habitats in Algeria have national park status. Protected areas in Morocco harbouring populations of this species include the Toubkal National Park, Eastern High Atlas N.P., Ifran N.P., Talassemtane N.P., Bou Hachem Natural Reserve and Djebel Moussa SIBE in Morocco, and the Djurdjura, Taza, Chréa, and Gouraya National Parks in Algeria. However, the parks in Algeria and Morocco suffer from significant human impact, and these areas require much stricter protection than is currently in place.<br/><br/>In Algeria, there is increasing awareness of the importance of protecting Barbary Macaques. For example, managers of the national parks of Chrea, Djurdjura and Gouraya/Bejaia have recently started filling in systematic incident reports any time monkeys are observed being killed, injured or have disappeared as a consequence of human activity (Benrabah 2015). Such records give useful estimates of the type/intensity of threats faced by the monkeys. Although a trend of population decline in Algeria and Morocco has been documented over the last 30 years, the rate of decline has been lower in Algeria than in Morocco. Threats facing Barbary Macaques in Algeria slightly differ from those of the Moroccan population. Tourism impacts are less noticeable in Algeria due to the lack of development of a tourist industry. In addition, surveillance by military and policing authorities is comparably higher in Algeria, contributing to a lower risk of poaching and illegal trade. Habitat degradation and human conflict over agricultural habitats are the primary causes of macaque population decline. Access to mountain and forested regions has increased since the civil strife of the 1990s in Algeria, thus increasing competition between humans and macaques in relation to the use of habitats for agriculture, domestic herd grazing and garbage disposal. <br/><br/>The Moroccan High Commission of Water and Forests along with a Dutch NGO, Moroccan Primate Conservation (MPC), published an action plan for the Barbary Macaque in 2012, focusing on the population in Ifane National Park. In 2016, the Algerian authorities are organising an action planning workshop assisted by IUCN. The Moroccan NGO BMCRif will collaborate with stakeholders to organise action planning workshops in 2017 and 2018 for the Rif populations.</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Mediterranean

Some populations in protected areas have increased, but the majority of the population resides outside of protected areas. If present trends continue, the Red-fronted Gazelle’s distribution and numbers will probably decline further until its status becomes Endangered; for example, at present less than 10% of its total numbers occur in populations which are known to be stable or increasing. Field surveys are urgently needed to assess its current status.","Formerly this species was widespread in the Sahel zone in the sahelian grasslands, savannas and savanna woodlands, and shrubland. Red-fronted Gazelle is able to adapt to human occupation of its habitat to some extent; for example, it is known to reoccupy fallow land if sufficient cover is available. It occurs locally in small to moderate numbers in areas of largely unexploited rangeland. They are known to make seasonal movements in parts of the range, although these are increasingly restricted by human settlement.","Red-fronted Gazelle populations have been reduced to scattered remnants over most of its range by illegal hunting, competition with domestic livestock, and habitat degradation resulting from drought, overgrazing of livestock and clearance of land for agriculture.","The available information on this species’ numbers is based mainly on informed guesses. East (1999) produced an estimated total population of about 21,000, including <em>ca</em> 4,000 in Niger and <em>ca</em> 3,000 in Mali. Numbers in both these countries are now considered to be much lower and population trends throughout the range are almost universally downwards.

Numbers in Somalia have declined steeply and are continuing to decline due to uncontrolled hunting, drought and habitat degradation through overgrazing.

The presence of a biting tabanid fly (<em>Haematopota</em> sp.) during the mid-growing season prompts movements to the coast or large inland sand dunes where the breeze disperses the flies. Speke's Gazelles also move to these areas in the late dormant season because the sparse vegetation stays green longer on these sites, possibly because the roots access soil moisture stored deeper in the dunes (Thurow 2013). In Somaliland, Speke's Gazelle occurs on open grassland plains (<em>bans</em>), occasionally in open <em>Acacia bussei</em> bush, and stony hillsides with sparse <em>Acacia etbaica</em> and <em>Buxus hildebrandtii</em> bushes up to 1,650 m (Mallon and Jama 2015).","Extreme political instability and periodic civil and military conflicts over the past 20 years (and continuing) in Somalia, combined with a lack of any central government control, has resulted in a prevalence of weapons, over-exploitation and lack of protection for wildlife.

Numbers have been falling steadily for over 20 years due to uncontrolled hunting. The former strongholds in the coastal and Nogaal plains of Somalia have been under severe pressure during the past two decades of civil war and there is no evidence that it still occurs in Ethiopia; gazelle populations have been eliminated near roads in areas of civil conflict and these activities have expanded over the past few decades (Thurow 2013).",Decreasing,"Speke's Gazelle (<em>Gazella spekei</em>) is endemic to the Horn of Africa and was formerly widespread in the arid grasslands of central, north-east and northern Somalia and the central coastal region.

The East and West African populations are much smaller. However, recent evidence has emerged that the South African population underwent a decline of 61-73% in the last three generations&#160;(15 years). This is by far the largest of the three populations and results in an overall decline of 55% in three generations.","Mountain Reedbuck live on ridges and hillsides in broken rocky country and high-altitude grasslands (often with some tree or bush cover), from 1,500-5,000 m (East 1999, Avenant 2013). They are predominantly grazers, and water is an important habitat requirement.","The main threats to Mountain Reedbuck include the expansion of human settlement, poaching, widespread disturbance by cattle herders and their livestock, and hunting by dogs (Avenant 2013).","The total population was estimated at over 36,000 individuals in 1999 (33,000 Southern Mountain Reedbuck, 2,900 Chanler's Mountain Reedbuck, and 450 Western Mountain Reedbuck), although the estimate for Chanler’s Mountain Reedbuck may be very conservative if this subspecies still occurs in significant numbers on private land in Kenya (East 1999). The estimate for Western Mountain Reedbuck may also be slightly low; they have been reported as locally common, albeit declining, in Gashaka Gumti N.P. (Nicholas 2004). The Southern Mountain Reedbuck has recently been reported to have unexpectedly declined by 61-73% (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Densities of Mountain Reedbuck within protected areas vary greatly  according to factors such as the extent of suitable habitat.

The subspecies <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> is abundant on both formally and privately protected land. A minimum population size of 54,426 mature individuals of <em>D. p. phillipsi </em>is estimated (using a 70% mature population structure) across 678 protected areas and wildlife ranches (counts between 2010 and 2016). There are at least an estimated 17,235 animals (counts between 2013 and 2016) on formally protected areas across the country. The population has increased significantly over three generations (1990-2015) in formally protected areas across its range and it is suspected to have also increased on private lands. Apart from hybridisation there are currently no major threats to long-term survival. The number of mature individuals of<em> D. p. pygargrus</em> is estimated at 752–1,618 individuals, but the number of pure Bontebok is unknown and the area of occupancy is limited and available habitat is decreasing.","<em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi </em>occur primarily on grasslands, especially open  plateau grasslands, characteristic of the South African Highveld,  extending to altitudes of up to 2,000 m asl (East 1999). They prefer  short grass and depend largely on the availability of drinking water  (David and Lloyd 2013). <em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> is very closely associated with  the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion. They are almost exclusively  grazers with a preference for short grass and recently burnt veld  (Beukes 1984, 1987; Novellie 1987; Kraaij and Novellie 2010). Water is  an essential requirement and they stay within 1.5 km of surface water  during the dry season.<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are adapted to unique  habitat and climatic conditions: the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion  receives some rain throughout the year but has a distinct peak during  winter with about 65% of rain falling between April and October. This  subspecies has thus adapted over at least 20,000 years to a climate of  wet and cold winters and warm and dry summers, the opposite to the  conditions experienced by <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> with warm and wet  summers and very cold but dry winters.<br/><br/>For further detail see the subspecies accounts.","The translocation of both Blesbok and Bontebok outside their natural range is a significant threat to the continued existence of the two subspecies, as hybridisation takes place and becomes increasingly likely. <br/><br/>The major threats for <em>D. p. pygargus</em> are hybridisation with <em>D. p. phillipsi,</em> the lack of available habitat within the natural range, low genetic diversity (probably the result of two bottlenecks caused by overhunting and disease; van der Walt <em>et al</em>. 2001) and poor gene flow between subpopulations. The overall management concern is the lack of a metapopulation management strategy for this subspecies.<br/><br/>Hybridisation is currently a priority issue in <em>D. p. pygargus</em>, but the extent of hybridisation in the <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> population is currently unknown and further research is required. Breeding of colour variants that may be associated with deleterious mutations may, if released in large numbers, reduce effective population size and can affect wild populations if carriers are released into formally protected areas.","East (1999) estimated there to be at least 235,000-240,000 Blesbok (stable or increasing), of which 97% occur on private farms and 3% in protected areas, and at least 2,300 Bontebok (increasing). <br/><br/>Currently, the total population of <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> is estimated to be at least 77,751 animals (2010–2016 counts) on 678 protected areas and wildlife ranches, equating to 54,426 mature individuals using a 70% mature population structure. On formally protected areas, there were at least 17,235 animals counted between 2013 and 2016 (EWT unpubl. data). <br/><br/>For <em>D. p. pygargus</em> the population in all formally protected areas and private ranches within both the natural and benign introduction range is estimated at 752–1,618 mature individuals. However, this estimate does not account for hybridisation which might reduce the number of eligible private subpopulations dramatically. Outside the natural and benign introduction range, there are an observed 4,857 individuals which are not included in this assessment as they are not considered free-ranging (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).",Increasing,"Blesbok is endemic to southern Africa. Historically, <em>Damaliscus pygargus pygargus</em> ranged across the Highveld grasslands of South Africa in the Free State and Gauteng provinces, extending into northwestern KwaZulu-Natal, and through parts of the Karoo in the Eastern and Northern Cape. <em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi</em> is endemic to the Western Cape, the ranges of the two forms separated by over 300 km (Skinner and Chimimba 2005).<br/><br/>Range and population were reduced by hunting in the 19th century but populations of <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> have recovered remarkably, especially on private land, and have been relocated across South Africa to regions both within and outside its indigenous range (for example, Power 2014). Formerly present in western Lesotho, but hunted to extinction before 1900 (Lynch 1994). Swaziland is outside the historical range, but extralimital introductions have occurred in Malolotja Nature Reserve and Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary (Monadjem 1998). The species has also been introduced to private game farms outside its indigenous range in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia (East 1999).<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are endemic to the Western Cape, South Africa, although introductions have been made in most provinces. Historically, they were confined to the coastal plain east of the Kogelberg in the Western Cape where they are believed to have concentrated on the renosterveld areas (Boshoff and Kerley 2001, Skead 2011). Extra-limital subpopulations have been established on private farms or ranches in at least the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West provinces, and there is pressure to increase the extent of introduction (Power 2014).","Used for commercial trophy hunting on a national and international scale, and by subsistence hunters for meat. They are also sold as live animals at game auctions. <em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi</em> are culled for management purposes and commercially for meat. They have also recently been bred intensively for colour variants. <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> are a flagship, endemic species for South Africa’s Highveld grasslands, and are a valuable component of South Africa’s commercial hunting industry. <em>Damaliscus p. pygargus </em>are a flagship subspecies of the Cape Floristic Region, particularly renosterveld, and can be used in ecotourism ventures.",Terrestrial,"The Bontebok <em>D. p. pygargus</em> is listed in CITES Appendix II. <br/><br/>This species occurs within a number of formally and privately protected areas across a number of provinces in South Africa.

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the various subpopulations results in a total of more than 195,000 whales. Given that there are no estimates for most of the Russian High Arctic, total abundance is likely more than 200,000. At least four subpopulations number more than 20,000 individuals. Some subpopulations are reduced below historical levels and some small subpopulations are declining but data are not adequate to assess overall population reduction or trend. As a species, Beluga Whales do not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and are listed as Least Concern.</p>  <p>Belugas in Cook Inlet have been assessed by IUCN as a separate subpopulation and are classified on the Red List as Critically Endangered (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several other subpopulations are small, declining, and/or occupy restricted areas, and warrant Red List assessment at the subpopulation level.</p>","Belugas are relatively well-studied as a result of carcass sampling conducted in association with hunting (Heide-Jørgensen and Teilmann 1994, Suydam 2009) along with a considerable amount of satellite-linked radio-tracking (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005), and aerial survey efforts (Moore, 2000, Belikov and Boltunov 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/> Belugas occupy estuaries, continental shelf and slope waters, and deep  ocean basins in conditions of open water, loose ice, and heavy pack ice  (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). In summer, they are found in coastal waters as shallow as 1–3 m deep and also in offshore waters thousands of meters deep. They typically enter estuaries and sometimes move upstream into rivers; there are records of individuals or small groups ranging hundreds of kilometers from the sea (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Belugas generally prefer to overwinter in areas with light or highly moveable ice cover (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2001, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may occur as fully Arctic subpopulations (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998b, <em></em> 2001; Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or Subarctic subpopulations (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> Some Belugas undertake large-scale annual migrations between summering and wintering sites (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while others remain in the same area year-round, shifting offshore only when excluded from coastal habitat by fast-ice formation (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). Large numbers of migratory Belugas occur along the northwestern and northern Alaskan coast, in the Canadian high Arctic, and in western Hudson Bay. At certain times of the year, those whales migrate thousands of kilometers, in some cases as far as 80°N into dense pack ice (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or thousands of kilometers into the North Water polynya or to the pack ice off West Greenland (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). In some areas, beluga distribution appears to be determined by sea ice extent, with belugas shifting offshore during low-ice years to maintain associations with the marginal ice zone (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Non-migratory Belugas that generally make seasonal shifts in distribution of less than a few hundred kilometers are found in Cook Inlet, Cumberland Sound, Svalbard, and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kingsley 2002, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> While the general features of Beluga Whale habitat can be described for the relatively well-studied subpopulations, the importance of those features is not well understood (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). For example, the summer occupation of nearshore/estuarine waters has been ascribed alternatively to feeding (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1982), to warm water providing a thermal advantage to neonates (Sergeant and Brodie 1969), and to the presence of fresh water and coarse substrates facilitating skin shedding during molt (St. Aubin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993). The relative importance of each of those factors likely varies according to the environmental conditions (e.g., water temperatures and prey availability) specific to each of the summering areas (Frost and Lowry 1990). Similarly, it is unclear why Belugas sometimes move into deep, ice-covered waters (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2016). One potential reason would be to avoid predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992). However, movements into the ice appear excessive for what would be needed to avoid Killer Whales (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and actually could expose Belugas to predation by Polar Bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987) as well as increase the risk of entrapment in the ice. It is possible that Belugas move into ice-covered offshore regions for feeding, primarily on Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), but few data are available to test this hypothesis (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, the associations of Belugas with features such as the continental shelf break and slope (Moore 2000, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be related to biophysical processes that produce good feeding conditions (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/> <br/> Beluga dives may last more than 20 minutes and can reach depths of more than 900 m (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Beluga has a diverse diet, which varies greatly from area to area. Although various species of fish are considered to be the primary prey items (including Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.), Herring (<em>Clupea </em>spp.), and Arctic Cod), Belugas also feed on a wide variety of mollusks (such as squid and octopus) and benthic crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) (Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas throughout their Arctic range (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease. Belugas are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance varies among the many Beluga subpopulations.</p><p>Hunting for human consumption is the biggest known threat to Belugas  across certain portions of their range. The most immediate concerns  relate to continuing harvests from small and depleted subpopulations (IWC  2000). The strong philopatry of Belugas, which causes them to return to  the same estuaries year after year, makes them highly vulnerable to  overexploitation. This behavioural trait is undoubtedly the most  important natural factor that has led to the extirpation of Belugas from  some parts of their range by a combination of commercial and  subsistence hunting (e.g., in southwestern Greenland and some river  mouths in Ungava Bay, Canada). In nearly all regions hunting is now  being controlled by limiting takes to sustainable levels (see  the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section).<br/> </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial reduction in the seasonal extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as changes in timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Belugas occur only in regions where sea ice occurs at least seasonally, suggesting a strong connection with sea ice influenced habitat. However, Belugas from some subpopulations spend many months in open water far from any ice while others spend most of their time in regions with sea ice concentrations up to 90%, indicating that the species as a whole has substantial flexibility in its relationships with ice (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). Belugas that occupy ice covered areas may do so for feeding on abundant ice-associated species such as Arctic Cod (<em></em>Loseto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Changes in the distribution and characteristics of sea ice will result in changes in productivity and prey species types and abundance (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008, Haug <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the potential costs or benefits to Belugas of such changes are not known. Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992) and it is generally assumed that concentrated sea ice provides Belugas some degree of refuge from predation. There is good evidence that Killer Whales are expanding their range in Arctic regions where sea ice has been declining (Higdon and Ferguson 2009, Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Belugas are susceptible to entrapment when sea ice conditions change rapidly and if they cannot escape they may die or be preyed upon by Polar Bears <em></em> and/or humans (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/></p>  <p>Known or potential threats include a variety of human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is allowing increases in the scale and distribution of some of those activities in areas previously covered with heavy ice. Ongoing and expanding oil and gas development, along with commercial shipping, is likely to impact habitats used by Belugas. Such impacts may be especially acute in shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage which traverses much of the summering habitat of belugas in Canada and Greenland (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas such as the Mackenzie Delta, West Greenland, and the Barents Sea are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which may include seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by icebreaking and shipping. Much of this activity is undertaken in the summer months in the same areas occupied by Belugas. In a study of responses of Belugas to icebreaking ships, the whales typically moved rapidly along ice edges away from approaching ships and showed strong avoidance reactions to approaching ships at distances of 35–50 km (Finley <em>et al</em>. 1990, Erbe and Farmer 2000). Expansion of commercial fisheries into new Arctic regions may have implications for bycatch of Belugas in fishing gear and depletion of Beluga prey resources. Construction of dams for hydroelectric development in the Hudson Bay area and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence may have affected Belugas because of their dependence on estuarine conditions (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p> Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants from those sources that are high enough to cause impacts on health (Ross 2000). Threats from contaminants are of concern for Belugas in some areas. High levels of several contaminants have been found in Belugas sampled in the Canadian Arctic (Braune <em>et al</em>. 2005). Studies of the SLE Beluga subpopulation have found that concentrations of both total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated PCB congeners are much higher than in Belugas in the Arctic. Some scientists believe that the increased occurrence of opportunistic bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, gastric ulcers and other disorders in SLE Belugas is evidence of a link between immune system dysfunction and PCB exposure (Martineau <em>et al</em>., 1994). SLE Belugas also have elevated tissue levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants) (Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Belugas are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2005). Significant epizootics have not been recorded in Belugas, but serological screenings document pathogen exposure (e.g., Alekseev <em>et al</em>. 2009) and necropsies find a variety of health issues (e.g., Martineau <em>et al</em>. 1988). Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. (2016) found low level exposure to biotoxins (domoic acid 2 of 15 tested and saxitoxin 1 of 12 tested) in Beluga samples from Cook Inlet. A mass mortality event in summer 2008 in the SLE, which included several Belugas, was linked to an intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium tamarense</em> (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could impact disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p>The global Beluga population consists of multiple subpopulations with varying degrees of differentiation and abundance (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to the lack of sampling, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee organized information on Belugas on the basis of 29 provisional management stocks (IWC 2000), and a recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 21 stocks (NAMMCO in prep.).<br/></p>    <p>Stocks are generally based on nearshore areas (principally fjords, bays, and estuaries) where Belugas congregate during part of the open water season. Satellite telemetry, genetic studies, and organochlorine analyses have shown that Belugas have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2002; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, de March <em>et al</em>. 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Palsbøll <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some stock boundaries overlap spatially and seasonally during winter and during the spring and fall migrations (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014). For stocks that winter in the Bering Sea, limited satellite tracking data suggest that areas used generally do not overlap in the same year, suggesting that Belugas from different stocks have traditional winter ranges that are mostly exclusive (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  <p>While good abundance estimates are available for some Beluga subpopulations, the sizes of others are virtually unknown or only roughly approximated (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Available information is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Okhotsk Sea</strong></p>  <p>Belugas occur in two well-separated regions of the Okhotsk Sea.<em> </em>In the northeastern region, they summer along the coast and in estuaries of Shelikhov Bay and winter along the ice edge of the Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.<em> </em>Based on surveys in 2010, Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated there were 1,333 surface-visible Belugas in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea, resulting in an estimate of 2,666 total whales when corrected for availability bias (animals not seen because they were diving). In the western Okhotsk Sea, Belugas occur in the northern Sakhalin Bay and Amur River region as well as several smaller bays along the Shantar coast (Ulbansky Bay, Udskaya Bay, Tugursky Bay and Nikolskaya Bay.<em> </em>There Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated 4,780 visible Belugas and 9,560 in total. The population trend is unknown in both regions. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Alaska and Western Canada</strong></p>  <p>Five subpopulations of Belugas are known to occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. All five winter in the Bering Sea (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations migrate northward in spring and spend summer and early fall well north of Bering Strait (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bristol Bay, Anadyr Gulf, and eastern Bering Sea subpopulations remain in the Bering Sea south of Bering Strait (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2016, NAMMCO in prep., Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC) unpublished data). </p>  <p>Bristol Bay Belugas have been counted using aerial surveys conducted periodically between 1993 and 2016.<em> </em>Correction factors to account for animals missed were applied to counts made in 2004 and 2005 (Lowry <em>et al. </em>2008) which produced an abundance estimate of 2,887 whales (Muto <em>et al. </em>2016).<em> </em>Similar correction factors applied to the 2016 count resulted in a population estimate of 3,166 whales (ABWC unpublished data). Lowry <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported that counts of Bristol Bay Belugas increased by 4.8% per year during 1993-2005 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–7.5%). The estimate based on 2016 counts was similar to 2004/05 suggesting that the increasing population trend had leveled off (ABWC unpublished data). </p>  <p>Belugas in Anadyr Gulf have never been surveyed adequately. An analysis of Beluga sightings obtained opportunistically during a survey for Pacific Walruses (<em>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</em>) conducted in the western Bering Sea in April 2006 estimated 15,125 Belugas in the area (with availability correction factor applied). However, the survey did not cover all areas known to be used by Anadyr Belugas, and it is possible that individuals from other subpopulations were also in the survey area. The maximum count along the coast in Anadyr Bay was 241 whales, and expert opinion suggests that the total Anadyr subpopulation is about 3,000 whales with fairly stable abundance (NAMMCO in prep.). </p>  <p>Aerial surveys for Belugas were flown in the eastern Bering Sea periodically during 1992-2001. Data collected in 2000 were used in distance sampling analysis that resulted in an estimate of 3,497 surface-visible Belugas in the survey area. The total abundance estimate was 6,994 whales (95% CI 3,162-15,472) when a correction factor for availability was applied (Lowry <em>et al</em>. in press). There are currently no data with which to estimate population trend, but another survey of the subpopulation was conducted in 2017. </p>  <p>Early estimates of the size of the eastern Chukchi Sea Beluga stock relied on June-July counts of whales in and near coastal lagoons with correction factors applied to account for animals missed.<em> </em>Those studies resulted in abundance estimates of roughly 2,000-4,000 whales (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1988, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>Subsequent tagging of whales with satellite depth recorders (SDRs) showed that during summer they had a very broad distribution, including considerable time spent in offshore areas where they were missed during coastal lagoon surveys (Suydam 2009). Further analysis of SDR data from eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea Belugas (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014) showed there is a date range and region where data from offshore marine mammal surveys (Aerial Surveys of Alaskan Marine Mammals (ASAMM); Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2013) could be used to estimate abundance of the eastern Chukchi subpopulation.<em> </em>That analysis (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2017) estimated there were 5,547 (CV 0.22) surface-visible Belugas in the study area in 2012. Data from SDRs were used to develop correction factors to account for animals that were missed because they were outside of the study area or diving too deep to be seen, resulting in a total abundance estimate of 20,752 whales (CV 0.70). Trend in abundance is unknown but there are several other years of ASAMM survey data that could be analyzed to look for changes over time. <br/></p>  <p>The most recent estimate of abundance for the eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga stock is 39,258 whales (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>This number was derived from aerial surveys conducted in the Mackenzie Delta and eastern Beaufort Sea in 1992 that estimated 19,629 (CV 0.23) surface visible Belugas (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 1996) and a correction factor to account for submerged whales.<em> </em>Synoptic surveys for Belugas were conducted in the region only in 1992, but Beluga sightings were recorded during offshore Bowhead Whale (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) surveys in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 2007-09. The number of Belugas counted at the surface was substantially higher during the 2007-09 surveys but it is unclear whether this was due to a shift in distribution or population increase (Harwood and Kingsley 2013). <br/></p>  <p>An isolated subpopulation of Belugas occurs in Cook Inlet, Alaska where they reside throughout the year (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Sightings are occasionally made outside of Cook Inlet in the Gulf of Alaska (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2000), and there is a small group (&lt; 20 animals) that is apparently resident in Yakutat Bay approximately 600 km to the east (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is considered to be part of the Cook Inlet stock (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Beluga abundance in the Inlet, including corrections for availability and sightability, is determined using aerial counts and video analysis of whale groups (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2000). The 2014 survey produced an estimate of 340 whales (CV 0.08; Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<em> </em>Abundance declined by nearly 50% between 1988 and 1994, and by about 1.3%/year during 1994-2014 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Canada and Greenland</strong></p><p>There are currently three main population centers for Belugas in Arctic Canada, High Arctic-Baffin Bay (HA-BB), Cumberland Sound, and Hudson Bay. A subpopulation that once occurred in southwest Greenland in winter is likely extirpated (NAMMCO in prep.). HA-BB Belugas summer mostly in nearshore waters around Somerset Island (Koski and Davis 1980, Smith and Martin 1994) and winter in northern Baffin Bay and off West Greenland (Doidge and Finley 1993, Heide-Jørgensen and Laidre 2004). An aerial survey of the Canadian High Arctic in summer 1996 produced an availability-adjusted abundance estimate of 21,213 whales (95% CI 10,985-32,619; Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>A 2012 winter survey off West Greenland resulted in a corrected estimate of 9,072 Belugas (CV 0.32) (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling by Innes and Stewart (2002) indicated a major decline in HA-BB Beluga abundance occurred between 1981 and 1994.<em> </em>Current trend in abundance is unknown. </p>  The Cumberland Sound Beluga subpopulation remains in the Cumberland Sound area throughout the year (Richard and Stewart 2008). Aerial surveys were conducted in typically used portions of the Sound in 2014, and abundance was estimated using a combination of visual surveys and photographic counts.<em> </em>The total abundance estimate (corrected for availability bias) was 1,151 whales (95% CI 761–1,744; Marcoux <em>et al</em>. 2016). Marcoux and Hammill (2016) constructed a model of this subpopulation using survey data collected during 1980-2014 and harvest data for 1920-2015.<em> </em>Results indicated that current abundance is substantially reduced compared to 1960 and that abundance is still declining.          <p>Four Beluga stocks occur in the Hudson Bay region.<em> </em>The eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and western Hudson Bay (WHB) stocks summer in the regions for which they are named and winter principally in Hudson Strait (NAMMCO in prep.). Although some interbreeding occurs on the wintering grounds (Turgeon <em>et al</em>. 2012), genetic studies show that the two groups are distinct (deMarch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Colbeck <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that cultural transmission of migration routes exists which likely acts to minimize interchange between the groups.<em> </em>Systematic aerial surveys of EHB Belugas have been flown seven times since 1985. Surveys flown in 2015 produced an availability-corrected estimate of abundance of 3,819 whales (CV 0.43; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling of the series of survey estimates and harvest data for 1972-2016 indicates that abundance declined during 1974-2002, but has been stable since then (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Abundance of WHB Belugas was most recently estimated from visual and photographic aerial surveys flown in summer 2015. The availability-corrected estimate of total abundance was 54,473 whales (95% CI 44,988-65,957; Matthews <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Because of bad weather conditions, this estimate did not include the Ontario coast where nearly 15,000 whales were estimated in 2004 (Richard 2005). A comparison of surface abundance estimates from 2015 and 2004 for five strata surveyed in both years showed that 2015 counts were about 6% higher (NAMMCO in prep.). Belugas use James Bay in large numbers during the summer and remain in that region during winter (Bailleul <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> </em>The 2015 aerial survey estimated availability-corrected abundance as 10,615 (CV 0.25; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Estimates from similar surveys conducted from1985 to 2011 ranged from 4,720 to 19,439 whales so the trend in abundance is unclear. Belugas were once abundant in Ungava Bay, with summer aggregations in and near several rivers.<em> </em>Numbers are now greatly diminished with no animals sighted on-transect during aerial surveys conducted there since 1983 (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>However, some Belugas still occur occasionally in the area as indicated by off-transect sightings during aerial surveys (Kingsley 2000) and land-based sightings (Doidge <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using data from surveys conducted during 1985-2008, Doniol-Valcroze and Hammill (2012) estimated Ungava Bay Beluga abundance to be 32 individuals (95% CI 0-94).   </p><p>&#160;A relict subpopulation of Belugas occurs in the Saint Lawrence River estuary (SLE) that is isolated from all other subpopulations both geographically and genetically (Brown Gladden <em>et al</em>. 1999; de March and Postma 2003). Both the core range used in summer and the total range of SLE Belugas have shrunk considerably since the 1930s (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2010). The size of the SLE subpopulation is believed to have declined from 7,800 whales in the 1866 to about 1,000 in 1985 (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em> </em>Abundance has been monitored since 1988 using photographic aerial surveys.<em> </em>An integrated population model using survey counts and vital rates indicated that abundance increased slowly between the 1960s and early 2000s then declined to an estimated 889 in 2012 (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Svalbard and Russian Arctic </strong></p>  <p>The Svalbard Beluga subpopulation is geographically isolated and genetically differentiated from subpopulations to the east and west (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2010). During the ice-free season Belugas in the archipelago are found very nearshore, often at the faces of glaciers (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>During winter, sea ice formation causes them to move offshore somewhat but they remain in the Svalbard area (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>Currently there is no abundance estimate for Svalbard Belugas but the first ever survey was to be conducted in summer 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>The Beluga subpopulation in the White Sea is genetically differentiated from other subpopulations (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>In summer, the whales are seen in several aggregation areas in the major bays (Andrianov <em>et al</em>., 2009, Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Alekseeva <em>et al</em>., 2012). While some investigators believe that in winter Belugas move to the Barents Sea, they are seen in the White Sea in March (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and all of the Belugas tracked with satellite-linked tags have stayed in the White Sea (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2012, Svetochev and Svetocheva 2012, Kuznetsova <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aerial surveys for belugas were flown in the White Sea in July six times during 2005-2011. The abundance estimate for 2011 was 5,593 whales (CV 0.14), and estimates from prior years ranged from 5,009 to 7,464 (Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012a). Available data suggest that abundance is stable. <br/></p>  <p>Belugas have been recorded at many other locations along the Arctic coast of Russia, including the Kara, Barents, Laptev, and East Siberian seas as well as Nova Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964, Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012b). A compilation of observations made during 1958-1995 from sea ice reconnaissance flights showed many sightings in coastal and offshore waters from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea but few observations in the East Siberian Sea (Belikov and Boltunov 2002). Boltunov and Belikov (2002) considered that the primary summer habitats are near Franz Josef Land and in the Kara Sea and western Laptev Sea, and that most of Belugas from this region winter in the Barents Sea. There are no estimates of current abundance, but given the size of the area and the number of animals taken by historical whaling (Boltunov and Belikov 2002), it is likely that Belugas were once numerous there.<em></em><br/></p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p>Summing the various estimates above gives a total of approximately 195,000 Belugas in the surveyed subpopulations. Because no abundance estimates are  available for Svalbard and the Russian High Arctic and the estimate for the White Sea is not corrected for availability, it is nearly certain that total rangewide abundance is more than 200,000. Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) calculated that in a pristine Beluga population 68% of all individuals would be mature. Using that value the total number of mature Belugas is estimated at about 136,000. The number of mature Belugas in the largest subpopulation, WHB, is about 37,000.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Generation time is an important parameter for several of the IUCN Red List criteria, and calculations of generation time require an accurate method for determining or estimating ages of individuals. For Beluga Whales, this has been done primarily by counting layers in the teeth of harvested or stranded animals. Counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) have usually been converted to age in years assuming there were two GLGs formed each year (Brodie 1971, Sergeant 1973, Burns and Seaman 1988, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Formation of two GLGs per year was supported by examination of teeth from captive, known age, individuals (Brodie 1982, Goren <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2006) measured the incorporation of atomic bomb radiocarbon into Beluga tooth GLGs, and used those measures to estimate age. When those estimates were compared to ages based on formation of one GLG versus two GLGs/year, the data fit the one GLG/year assumption. Lockyer <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined 10 teeth from captive Belugas and found clear support for one GLG/year in six of the specimens, but results for the others were equivocal.  Hohn <em>et al</em>. (2016) considered that the bomb radiocarbon study and long-term photoidentification studies showed that GLG deposition is “unquestionably annual.” (also see Matthews and Ferguson 2014). However, Brodie <em>et al</em>. (2013) continued to argue for two GLGs/year, based on field observations of Beluga life history parameters in Cumberland Sound, captive animal studies, and suggested problems with studies that support one GLG/year. Using the assumption of two GLGs/year, Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated generation time for belugas as 16.4 years for a population in a pre-disturbance state. If one GLG/year is actually the case, generation time would be much longer, but calculations using that assumption have not been done.</p><span lang=""EN-CA""><p>Data on historical sizes of Beluga subpopulations are sparse. Innes and Stewart (2002) estimated the historical carrying capacity (K) of the HA-BB  subpopulation as 39,790 whales. Bettridge <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated K for Sakhalin - Amur Belugas as between 13,200 and 20,800. Cumberland Sound Belugas were estimated to number 3,100 in 1960 (Marcoux and Hammill 2016). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated that there were 6,663 Belugas in EHB in 1974. Abundance of                    Cook Inlet Belugas  in 1979 was estimated at 1,293 (NMFS 2003). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated that there were 7,800 Belugas (standard error 600) in the SLE in 1866. Comparing these figures with those for the most recent abundance estimates given above suggests a reduction of 88% for SLE belugas, and 28-74% for the other five subpopulations. While these comparisons show that some stocks have been substantially depleted and remain in that state, a species-wide reduction in abundance cannot be calculated. The difficulty of such a calculation is compounded by the lack of agreement on calibration of tooth layers for age estimation, which is central to determining generation length and the amount of depletion over time. The combined abundance of those six subpopulations known to be depleted constitutes less than 20% of the current species-wide abundance estimate, and there is no reason to think that all of the remaining subpopulations are similarly depleted.    </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>",Unknown,"<p>Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. (1964) correctly noted that “The Beluga is widely distributed throughout the northern seas.”<em> </em>More recent and more detailed mapping (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014) confirms that Belugas are widely distributed in Arctic regions, occurring nearly throughout northern waters of Russia, Alaska, Canada, West Greenland, and Svalbard. Gaps in the distribution occur off North and East Greenland and perhaps in central Russia. Sightings and telemetry studies show that Belugas occur north of 80° N latitude at Svalbard (Vacquié-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017), and north of western Russia (Belikov and Boltunov 2002) and Alaska (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>Subpopulations in the Okhotsk Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence occur in Subarctic waters as far south as 50° N (Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2010) and 47° N (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2012) respectively. Belugas have been recorded as vagrant at Japan, New Jersey and Washington State USA, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Rice 1998).</p>","<p></p><p>In the past Belugas were hunted commercially at several locations but that is no longer the case. They are legally hunted for food by indigenous communities in several parts of their range, including western and northern Alaska (Frost and Suydam 2010), western and eastern Canada (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2017), some parts of Russia (D. Litovka pers. comm.), and Greenland (Heide-Jørgensen and Rosing-Asvid 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Legally-harvested Beluga products may be sold in Alaska Native communities. Some illegal hunting may also occur, particularly in parts of Russia (NAMMCO, in prep.). Russia allows Belugas in the White Sea and in the Sakhalin Bay - Amur River delta region to be live-captured for public display.<em> </em>Numbers taken in the White Sea are small (probably 5-6 or fewer per year, NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>The number live-captured at Sakahlin is more substantial, 0-81 per year during 2000-2017 (Shpak and Glazov 2014, NAMMCO, in prep.). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated the sustainable annual removal of Belugas from the Sakhalin subpopulation to be 29 whales. Records of historical kills were used in a population model to estimate that the Sakhalin - Amur subpopulation meets the definition of depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which disallows imports for live display into the U.S. (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Although Belugas were hunted intensively on a commercial basis for oil and leather in many parts of their range during the 20th century, the only known direct removals at present are for food (subsistence use) and the aquarium trade. The Canada-Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB) is expected to ensure the conservation of shared stocks of Belugas while NAMMCO is a regional management body to which Canada, Greenland, and Norway belong. Catch limits and other recommendations on conservation of belugas are made on the basis of advice from joint meetings of the JCNB’s Scientific Working Group and NAMMCO’s Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic. Catch levels from hunted Beluga subpopulations range anywhere from less than ten to a few hundred animals per year. There is concern that Cumberland Sound Belugas are being hunted at unsustainable levels (NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>Removals from the Bristol Bay, Eastern Bering Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, and Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations are considered sustainable (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). In both Canada (Richard and Pike 1993) and Alaska (Adams <em>et al</em>. 1993), indigenous peoples’ organizations have entered into co-management agreements with government agencies to work on conservation of Beluga stocks. Harvests from the Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulation occur in both Alaska and Canada, and that is managed by an agreement between the North Slope Borough (Alaska) and the Inuvialuit Game Council (Canada).</p><p></p><p>As a species, the Beluga is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

They are among the more commonly studied cetaceans in the Indian Ocean, especially in Shark Bay, Western Australia. However, information on distribution, population size, and trends in abundance and mortality from much of the species’ range is still very limited. As they are primarily coastal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins often co-occur with fisheries, and bycatch is a major cause of concern for this species. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are also at risk from high levels of noise and chemical pollution, industrial activity such as oil and gas development, and habitat reduction caused by land reclamation and coastal development (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). Furthermore, survey data suggest that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in relatively small populations or communities with limited geographic ranges, especially where they reside close to islands (Krützen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Natoli <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Fury <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Särnblad <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2018), which can exacerbate the impact of human activities and demographic stochasticity on this species. </p>  <p>Estimates of abundance from populations for which information on bycatch is also available indicate that human-caused mortality is frequently unsustainable (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992, Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012, Preen 2004). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Based on the sum of existing abundance estimates, the total population size for the species over its entire range is likely well in excess of 40,000 individuals. Large parts of the range have never been surveyed (e.g. much of the Arabian Sea, Arabian/Persian Gulf, Pakistan, India, Red Sea, Somalia, Yemen, Mozambique, Indonesia, Philippines).</p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin was classified as Data Deficient in 2008. The species distribution overlaps the range of several other coastal cetacean species that are red-listed as Endangered (Irrawaddy Dolphin <em>Orcaella brevirostris</em> and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa plumbea</em>) or Vulnerable (Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa chinensis</em> and Australian Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa sahulensis, </em>Australian Snubfin Dolphin<em> Orcaella heinsohni</em> and the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise <em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) and are subject to the same anthropogenic threats. However, compared to these other species, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is assumed to be under less immediate threat because it has a wider geographic range and probably larger numbers, greater behavioural plasticity and broader habitat preferences. Data are insufficient to present a robust case for listing the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin in a threatened category (CR, EN, or VU). However, its coastal distribution, inferred local declines, and intensity of threats throughout its range lead to the conclusion that Least Concern is not an appropriate category.</p>  <p>The Red List Guidelines (version 11, 2014) state that “the category Near Threatened is applied to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying as threatened, and to taxa that do not currently meet the criteria for a threatened category, but are likely to do so if ongoing conservation actions abate or cease.” Also, to qualify for Near Threatened, the taxon “should be close to qualifying for the Vulnerable category; estimates of population size or habitat should be close to the Vulnerable thresholds, especially when there is a high degree of uncertainty, or possibly meet some of the subcriteria; and this may be combined with biological susceptibility and threat.” Considering the above, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is listed as Near Threatened because: 1) it occurs in a relatively small and restricted near-shore range<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, 2) it is highly vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and its range overlaps with intensive fisheries known to entangle and kill dolphins, 3) its near-shore habitat is subject to increasing anthropogenic threats resulting in habitat loss and degradation, and 4) it is experiencing mortality rates that are likely to be causing population declines in several areas. The species therefore comes close to meeting criterion A4 for Vulnerable. Population size is inferred and suspected to have declined by close to 30% throughout the range of the species, over three generations and in a time period encompassing the past, present and future. The causes of the reduction (gillnet entanglement and coastal habitat degradation) have not ceased. Generation length for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, according to Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007), is 21.1 years, therefore three generations is 63.3 years. Thus, an annual decline of around 0.5% would result in exceeding the 30% decline in 3 generations. Gillnet fisheries and coastal development are increasing throughout the range of the species and bycatch is anticipated to remain stable or to increase in the future without urgent and intensive efforts which are unlikely to be forthcoming.</span></p>  <p>It is important to emphasize that numerous isolated populations of this species would likely qualify as threatened subpopulations, particularly those found around island groups in the Indian Ocean.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins generally occur over shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf or around oceanic islands. In some locations, they occur relatively far from shore, but in the shallow waters of reef banks (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2012). In comparison to other areas, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins off the coast of Bangladesh occur in relatively deep offshore waters at the head of the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon where they were detected at an average depth of 202m (SD=112, range=45-395) (Smith and Mansur 2013). In the Clarence River estuary and Richmond River estuary in northern New South Wales, Australia, dolphin distribution varied according to season and tidal state (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Along the coast of Adelaide, South Australia, dolphins occur in shallow nearshore areas and temperate reefs in summer, shallow nearshore areas in autumn and deep waters further offshore in winter (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia, dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns and areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay, associated with shallow waters (2–4 m and 7–10 m) and located within 1km of land (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018a). Strong site fidelity and restricted ranging patterns are characteristic of some populations (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018b).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes occur in mixed groups with Common Bottlenose Dolphins, Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa plumbea</em>), spinner dolphins (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>), Australian humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) and possibly other delphinids (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015; Koper and Plön&#160;2016). They feed on a wide variety of schooling, demersal and reef fishes, as well as cephalopods (Ross 1984; Amir <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2005; Yamazaki <em>et al.</em> 2008). In some locations, large predatory reef fishes can represent an important proportion of their diet (Belonidae and Carangidae), such as around the island of Mayotte, in the SW Indian Ocean (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2014). Group size is generally less than 30 (see Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, for a review), but in South Africa mean group size in Algoa Bay is 76, and groups of up to 600 individuals are commonly observed (Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018, Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>Bycatch is the dominant threat affecting Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins throughout their range. However, there are very few estimates of mortality rates or abundance over time to evaluate the severity of the impact. In Australia, the major threats include bycatch in trawls and gillnets as well as in shark nets set at popular coastal beaches to protect bathers (Hale 1997, Paterson, 1990). A total of 15 Bottlenose Dolphins (species unknown) were confirmed to have died from net entanglement in southern blue-fin tuna feedlots between 1994 and 2000 (Kemper and Gibbs 2001). Research by Mintzer <em>et al.</em> (2018) into the global use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries reported that this practice is much more widespread within Taiwanese fisheries than is presently recorded. From 1974 to 1986, the Taiwanese shark and tuna gillnet fishery exploited the waters off northern Australia, including the Arafua and Timor Seas and was responsible for the incidental catch of a variety of small cetaceans, with <em>Tursiops </em>spp<em>. </em>likely<em> aduncus</em> comprising 60% of the total cetacean catch (Harwood &amp; Hembree 1987). The annual mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins may have exceeded 2,000 animals—severely impacting local population[s] (Young and Iudicello, 2007). As a result of this bycatch, the fishery was closed in 1986 (Young and Iudicello, <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_3;mso-comment-date:20190614T1311;mso-comment-parent: 1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_2;mso-comment-date:20190614T1310; mso-comment-parent:1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:LU_1;mso-comment-date: 20190603T0957"">2007</a>). </p>  <p>Off western Kyushu, Japan, mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in bottom-set gillnets was estimated at 12-14 individuals per year, which was considered unsustainable for the local population thought to number only somewhat more than 200 individuals (Shirakihara &amp; Shirakihara 2012). Photo-identification data collected off the coast of Bangladesh indicated that 28.2% of identified individuals had injuries related to entanglement gear (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012), and similar methods used in the coastal waters of Mayotte (Comoros archipelago, Mozambique Channel) showed that 19% of identified individuals bore signs of non-lethal interactions with coastal artisanal fisheries (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). In Bangladesh, between August 2016 and April 2018, 31 small-scale gillnet fishing vessels participating in a Citizen Science Fishermen Safety Network reported fatal entanglements of 14 dolphins and porpoises, of which seven were Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, during 177 fishing trips (Wildlife Conservation Society 2018). Off the island of Zanzibar (Tanzania), 43 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin captures in artisanal drift gillnets were reported from 1995 to 1999. The magnitude and population-level impact of gillnet bycatch in Zanzibar was assessed in 2003-2004, and it was found that annual bycatch rates were unsustainable as they represented 9.3% of the estimated local population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Amir 2010). Bycatch was also evaluated recently in drift gillnets off Zanzibar using landing data (Temple <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2019), and there are reports of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin mortality in coastal artisanal fisheries off mainland Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2009). Bycaught dolphins are often used as bait in longline fisheries targeting sharks (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, an average of 34 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins per year were accidentally killed by bather protection nets around beaches between 1981 and 1989 (Cockroft 1990). This increased to an average of 45/year from 1990-1999, and from 2000-2009 the estimate was 27/year (Cliff &amp; Dudley 2011). In general, catches have steadily declined since the 1980’s due to better management of nets and the replacement of some shark nets (gillnets) with drumlines (baited hooks) in recent years (Plön, unpublished). However, the majority of bycaught animals are immature individuals and mature females, raising concern about population-level impacts (Plön, unpublished). In most areas limited data on bycatch or a lack of information on population size mean that it is not possible to determine whether annual catch rates are sustainable or not. However, the strong overlap in gillnet fishing effort and the coastal distribution of this species, combined with fairly small population sizes in many areas that have been surveyed, suggest that fishery bycatch is sufficiently high to cause population declines in many places.</p>  <p>The species’ near-shore distribution makes it vulnerable to environmental degradation, direct exploitation, and fishery conflicts (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999; Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Until hunting was outlawed in 1990, <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> was the target of a large-scale drive fishery in Taiwan’s Penghu Islands. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in southern Japan and due to confusion with the commonly hunted Common Bottlenose Dolphin it is not clear whether they were ever specifically targeted by Japanese coastal cetacean fisheries in the past (Kasuya 2017). Some Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are taken in the small cetacean fisheries in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997) and Indonesia (Mustika 2006). Socio-ecological interview surveys in southwest Madagascar in 1999 indicated extensive hunting of coastal dolphins by Anakao fishermen of the Vezo community (Andrianarivelo, 2001). Dolphin species most often taken were the Spinner Dolphin, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin. Vezo fishers hunted coastal dolphins for local consumption and sale of meat (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Andrianarivelo (2001) estimated that over 6,000 individual dolphins, predominantly <em>Stenella</em> spp. and <em>Tursiops</em> spp. were taken in drive hunts between 1985 and 1999 from a single village, Anakao, and there was a substantial increase in catches evident during 1995–1999 accounting for 57% of all catches (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2009). The trend suggested an increase in intensity of hunting and impact on populations, likely associated with a change in hunting technique (from harpoons to nets) in the mid to late 1980s, and depletion of other food resources (e.g. decrease in fish populations), and subsequent increased adoption of cetacean hunting and consumption throughout the 1990s (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Subsequent interview surveys conducted between 2010-2013 demonstrated continuing high levels of both hunting and by-catch reported for <em>Tursiops</em> spp. along the entire west coast of Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were one of the most common species targeted by a drive-hunt in Zanzibar that stopped in 1996 (Berggren <em>et al.</em> 2007, Stensland and Berggren 2007). Anecdotal evidence suggests that several species of delphinids are hunted in the Seychelles (despite national prohibition), including Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Kiszka 2015). Although illegal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were recorded as hunted in a harpoon fishery in southern Myanmar with six carcasses documented as being sold in March 2006 at the Maungmagan market (Tint Tun 2006). This species is one of the more common small cetaceans that are used as bait to catch sharks. There is no current evidence of traditional use/trade for consumption or medicinal use across the species range in Australia although it may have happened in the past. </p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the cetacean species most commonly kept in captivity in Asia (Wang <em>et al.</em> 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Since the early 1960s, live-captures of <em>T. aduncus</em> for oceanarium display have occurred in many areas, including South Africa, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Java (Best and Ross 1984, Tas’an and Leatherwood 1984, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1994, Cawthorn and Gaskin 1984, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984). In 1974, 58 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were captured from Amami Oshima, Japan, for the Okinawa Expo and the aquarium which held them became the Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 1984). In 2003, a live-capture export trade was initiated in the Solomon Islands and a minimum of 108 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were exported between 2003 and 2011 to Mexico, UAE, China, the Philippines and Singapore (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2013; Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010). This level of removals from the local population(s) is probably unsustainable (Reeves &amp; Brownell 2009). In the mid 2000’s in Australia, 32 Bottlenose Dolphins, including both <em>T. aduncus </em>and <em>T</em>. <em>truncatus</em>, were held at Sea World, Surfers Paradise, Queensland, and four <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> were kept at Pet Porpoise Pool, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales (International Species Information System 2009). In China in 2014, 39 captive facilities housed 491 cetaceans, most of them<em> Tursiops</em> spp. most from Japan and not <em>T. aduncus</em> (Chinese Cetacean Alliance 2015). Twenty-three Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are held at Ocean Park in Hong Kong, and one in Sea World, Durban (<a href=""http://www.species360.org/"">www.Species360.org</a>, reported March-2019). </p>  <p>In South Africa, of the six dolphin species (n = 90) incidentally captured in shark net installations or stranded off the east and south coasts between 2005 and 2009, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins had the second highest levels of persistent organochlorines and approximately half of adult <em>T. aduncus</em> had PCB concentrations above the previously determined threshold (17,000 ng g<sup>−1</sup> lw) for impairment of immune functions in aquatic mammals (Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000; Gui <em>et al.</em> 2016); however it is important to note that other small cetaceans often report levels much higher than this. Despite this, systematic health assessments conducted on animals incidentally caught in shark nets between 2010 and 2012 indicated that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were generally in good health (Lane <em>et al.</em>, 2014). In Zanzibar, levels of organochlorine pesticides in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were lower than those reported from other regions, but methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether levels were higher (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010). Along the coast of La Réunion, DDTs, PCBs, and methoxylated-PBDEs were commonly found in blubber tissues of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Dirtu <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2016). However, concentrations were low compared to other locations, including Zanzibar (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p>Several diseases appear to be increasing in occurrence in coastal small cetaceans, raising concern for the health of these animals. Since the early 2000s, there have been several dolphin mortality events in Australia that have included <em>T. aduncus</em> (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2016). In these events all the dolphins tested positive for the cetacean morbillivirus. &#160;There are reports of a lobomycosis-like disease and other poor skin conditions in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins from Mayotte and Japan which is a concern for these locally restricted populations (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009, Van Bressem <em>et al.</em> 2013, Tajima <em>et al.</em> 2015). The etiology of the disease was not established, but it may be related to the degradation of their coastal habitat (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009). The bacterial pathogen of the genus <em>Brucella</em>&#160;has also been reported from Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. Forty of 58 serum samples from <em>T. aduncus</em> from the Solomon Islands tested positive for antibodies to <em>Brucella</em> (Tachibana <em>et al.</em> 2006). This pathogen in dolphins can be a severe disease and cause abortions, male infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathies, bone and skin lesions and death (Moreno&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Climate change, especially increases in sea surface temperature that are prevalent throughout coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, are negatively affecting coastal habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds used by Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. For example, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, an unprecedented marine heatwave in 2011 caused catastrophic losses of seagrass meadows along with mass mortality in invertebrate and fish communities. Long-term demographic data on Shark Bay’s resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin population revealed a significant decline in female reproductive rates following the heatwave (Wild <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the species most commonly targeted by dolphin-watching operators in the Indo-Pacific region and in some places where regulation is poor, the animals are harassed. Although dolphin-watching tourism is certainly not a threat to the species as a whole, changes in dolphin behavior have been observed in areas with intense dolphin-watching activity off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, Japan (Matsuda <em>et al.</em> 2011) and in Menai Bay, Zanzibar (Christiansen <em>et al.</em> 2010) and around Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Shark Bay, Western Australia, an increase in dolphin tourism coincided with a 14.9% decline in local dolphin abundance (95% CI=−20.8 to −8.23) (Bejder <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The disturbance caused by marine construction and demolition, port development, reclamation, dredging, and other forms of habitat destruction and degradation, together with associated anthropogenic noise, is hard to quantify, but such activities and processes are widespread throughout the coastal range of this species. Individually and cumulatively, they may be causing population declines through increased mortality, impaired health, and/or reduced reproductive fitness as well as by habitat displacement.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the best-studied species of small cetaceans in the Indian Ocean and in the western South Pacific (Solomon Islands). Although estimates of abundance (detailed below) are available for many local areas, the majority of their range has yet to be surveyed.&#160; Some available estimates are imprecise, lacking in sufficient details to evaluate their accuracy and context, and/or were generated sufficiently long ago (e.g. 20+ years ago) that, with increases in fishing intensity and coastal development, the present situation could be much different. In most locations studied, population sizes are small, typically in the low hundreds of individuals or fewer (&lt;100)<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. Exceptions include an estimate of between 1,700-2,200 individuals generated from data collected in 2005-2009 in Bangladesh, which represents an unknown portion of a larger super-population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins that extends farther west into un-surveyed waters in India; 2,000-3,000 dolphins documented to occur in Shark Bay, Western Australia; and a large population in the Algoa Bay region, South Africa estimated at about 28,000 individuals from data collected in the late 1990s (see details below).</p>  <p>In Australian waters, estimates of local populations indicate that this species is common mainly in inshore and nearshore waters. However, further genetic work is required to better define the distribution of the species, especially with regard to the taxonomic identity of particular populations to either <em>T. aduncus</em> or <em>T. truncatus</em>. Abundance estimates from surveys carried out between 2003 and 2006 for the Clarence River and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, were 71 (62–81 95% CI) and 34 (19– 49 95% CI), respectively (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Abundance estimates in Jervis Bay ranged from 61 ±3.2 in summer 1998/99 to 108 ±7.1 in summer 1997/98, and from 143 ±8.1 in summer 1999/00 to 160 ±8.1 in summer 1998/99 in Port Stephens (Möller <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Moreton Bay, Queensland, a population size of 554-622 (95% CI: 510–598) was estimated from boat-based surveys in 2008-2010 (Ansmann <em>et al.</em> 2013), with a further 700 to 1,000 individuals believed to occur off Point Lookout in 1998-99 (Chilvers and Corkeron&#160;2003). In southern Australia, where Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are those identified as “<em>T. australis</em>” (Charlton-Robb, 2011), resident populations of 80–100 animals occur in Port Phillip Bay and 50-150 in the Gippsland Lakes (unpublished data cited in Charlton-Robb <em>et al.</em> 2015). Local population estimates for South Australia indicated that approximately 74 resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins inhabited the Port River estuary and Barker Inlet, Gulf St Vincent (Steiner and Bossley 2008). From 1989 to 2005, between 95 (SE ±45.20) and 239 (SE ±54.91) individuals occurred in Adelaide’s coastal waters in winter 2013 and summer 2014, respectively (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016), and 306 (95% CI: 291–323) occurred in Coffin Bay between September 2013 and October 2015 (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Abundance estimates of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins, (likely to be the putative species ""<em>T. australis</em>"" based on their coastal distribution and small group size), was estimated&#160;using double-observer platform aerial surveys over an area of 42,438 km<sup>2</sup> within two gulfs of South Australia.&#160; A total of 3,493 (CV = 0.21; 95% CI = 2,327-5,244) individuals were estimated in summer/autumn, and 3,213 (CV = 0.20; 95% CI = 2,151-4,801) in winter/spring of 2011 (Bilgmann <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;&#160;A population of 63 (95% CI = 59 to 73) to 185 (95% CI = 171–200) Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated off Bunbury, Western Australia, during winter 2007 and in summer 2010, respectively (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sprogis <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In coastal and estuarine waters near Perth, Western Australia, total estimated abundances in the Swan Canning Riverpark estuary, Gage Roads, and Cockburn Sound/Owen Anchorage between June 2011 and May 2015 were 16, 172, and 103, respectively (Chabanne <em>et al.</em> 2017). Aerial surveys in 1989 and 1994 indicated that a population of 2,000-3,000 dolphins occurred in Shark Bay, Western Australia, most being Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Preen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In North Western Australia, 157 (95% CI: 137–186) individuals were estimated to inhabit Beagle Bay and 35 (27–48) to 60 (42–87) Cygnet Bay in 2012–2013 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Darwin Harbor and two neighboring sites, Northern Territory, abundance estimates ranged from 20 (95% CI 17 to 23) in October/November 2013 to 38 (95% CI 28 to 47) in October 2012 (Brooks <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Between 1994 and 2001, a total of 169 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were identified off Mikura Island, Japan (Kogi <em>et al.</em> 2004), and 216 individuals (CV=2.1%) were estimated off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, western Kyushu, Japan, in 2008 (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012). Approximately 1,000 km south of Tokyo an estimated 200-300 animals occur around the main Ogasawara Islands (Mori 2005). In the Swatch-of-No-Ground (SoNG) submarine canyon, off the coast of Bangladesh, mark-resight abundance estimates generated for 2005-2009 were 1,701 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,533–1,888), 1,927 (95% CI = 1,851–2,006), 2,150 (95% CI = 1,906–2,425), and 2,239 (95% CI = 1,985–2,524) individuals (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, abundance comparisons from two aerial surveys conducted in 1986 and 1999 in the southern-western area suggested an overall decline of 71% of small cetaceans over 13 years, where <em>T. aduncus</em> is estimated to account for 71% of the overall assemblage of dolphin species (Preen 2004). Surveys of Abu Dhabi waters conducted in 2014-2015 (55 boat-based surveys, 5,592 km of on effort transects) yielded an estimate of 1,834 (95% CI = 1,176-3,124) individuals (Díaz López and Methion 2016). Surveys of Dubai waters conducted in 2014 (56 boat-based surveys and 220 hours of effort) resulted in 8 sightings and 92 individuals being identified (A. Natoli, unpublished data).</p>  <p>In East Africa and around some islands of the western Indian Ocean, several abundance estimates are available. Between 1999 and 2002 off southwest Zanzibar, Tanzania the smallest estimate of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin abundance was 136 in 2001 (95%CI = 124-172) and the largest was 179 animals (95% CI = 167-212) in 2002 (Stensland <em>et al.</em> 2006). In southern Kenya, a population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated using mark-recapture as ranging from 19 individuals (95% CI: 11–33) to a maximum of 104 dolphins (95% CI: 78–139) (Pérez-Jorge <em>et al.</em> 2016) based on photo-identification data collected between 2006 and 2009. Off the southwest coast of Mauritius, a resident population of <em>T. aduncus </em>was estimated to number &lt;100 individuals based on surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). Off the coast of Pemba in Tanzania, another small resident population was estimated to number 83 (CV 7.8%, 95% CI 72-97) individuals (Kasuga <em>et al.</em> in review) and off the island of Mayotte abundance was estimated from closed population models at 82 ±19 SE individuals from data collected between 2004 and 2009 (Pusineri <em>et al.</em> 2014). Along the coast of La Réunion, an abundance of 72 (SE=6.17, 95%CI = 61-85) was estimated based on photo-identification data collected along the west coast from 2009 to 2014 (Dulau <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2017).</p>  <p>In South Africa, there appear to be both coastal (with mostly small group sizes) and migratory (with large group sizes) populations of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, but the boundaries between these are not well defined (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the number of individuals in the area between the Tugela River and Durban was estimated at 520 (160–970, 95% CI) in 1989 (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992). A maximum of 350 individuals was estimated in the area between Durban and Ramsgate (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em> 1991). Overall, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in the KZN area are likely fragmented into several populations (Natoli <em>et al.</em>, 2008). A migratory population in southeastern South Africa is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals and is characterized by large groups of hundreds of individuals (Natoli <em>et al.</em> 2008). An estimate of 28,482 (95% CI = 16,220–40,744; CV = 0.22) based on field work conducted in the mid 1990’s was calculated using POPAN mark-recapture analysis of photo-identified individuals in the Algoa Bay region of the Eastern Cape (<a name=""_Hlk3288225"">Reisinger and Karczmarski </a>2010). Due to the very low number of recaptures (131 out of 1,569 total captures), the estimation models fit the data poorly, which means that the point estimate, as well as the 95% CI, may not be accurate; however, the large number of identified individuals and small number of recaptures confirms that there was a sizeable population of this species in the wider Algoa Bay region at that time. Group sizes of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in Algoa Bay are consistently large for this species, being reported as typically ranging from 200-600 individuals (Ross 1982; Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017; Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is important to note that with intensifying fisheries and coastal development, the relatively favorable status of these dolphins in Algoa Bay could be very different now, 20+ years after the data used to generate the estimate by Reisinger and Karczmarski (2010) were collected.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in warm-temperate and tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. They are found primarily in shallow coastal and estuarine waters and in shallow reef complexes (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species occurs from Australia in the east, throughout southeast Asia (including the Malay Archipelago and Cocos [Keeling] Islands) (Tom Jefferson pers. comm.), China (north to the Korean Peninsula) and southwestern Japan) and around the northern Indian Ocean rim (including in the Red Sea and Arabian/Persian Gulf) to the western range limit in eastern South Africa (Wells and Scott 2002, Möller and Beheregaray 2001, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins also occur in the coastal waters of many oceanic islands distant from major land masses including the Maldives (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2012), the Andamans (Malakar <em>et al.</em> 2015), New Caledonia (Borsa 2006), the Comoros and Mayotte (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012), the Solomon Islands (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015), La Réunion (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al.</em> 2008), Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2014) and the Seychelles (Kiszka<em> </em>2015).</p>","<p>It is harvested for food in some places, and for international trade as display animals.</p>",Marine,"Specific conservation actions for this species are lacking from most of  the range of the species although they are generally legally protected  in most range states. Due to increasing pressure of dolphin watching  tourism in Mayotte, specific measures prohibiting swimming with this  species have been implemented. In Australia dolphin watching is  regulated and there are National Whale and Dolphin Watching Guidelines  in place. In other parts of the species range where there are dolphin  watching or swim-with-dolphins tourism these are either unregulated, or  there has been some effort to manage or regulate the activities but  guidelines are not followed. This species occurs in numerous Marine  Protected Areas (MPAs) throughout their range but these are usually  designed with a focus on other marine species and not specifically to  include key habitat for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. <br/><br/>The  exception to this is an MPA declared by the Government of Bangladesh in  2014 covering 1,700 km² which encompasses almost all Bottlenose Dolphin  sightings made during intensive cetacean surveys of coastal waters in  Bangladesh between 2004 to 2019. Efforts are still underway to establish  conservation management in this MPA. One promising approach for  reducing Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin bycatch in Bangladesh is an  initiative that requires gillnet fishermen to attend their nets, release  entangled dolphins, and collect data from mortalities in exchange for  capacity building to improve their safety at sea.<br/>Various strategies  have been tested to mitigate the unintentional catch of dolphins in  coastal bather protection nets in South Africa. Devices have been added  to the nets to make the nets more conspicuous acoustically (for example,  air-filled floats, clangers), or to deter the dolphins with sounds  (such as pingers), but these were not successful (Cliff and Dudley  2011). In the past decade, some gillnets have been replaced with baited  hooks (called drumlines) which have lower dolphin bycatch (Cliff and  Dudley 2011). <br/><br/>In Australia bycatch action plans for several  fisheries were introduced in 2001 to reduce the bycatch of dolphins and  other marine animals and these actions are managed by the Australian  Fisheries Management Authority. Mitigation measures, such as the use of  pingers to warn animals away from nets, escape panels in purse seine  nets, and handling methods for animals brought aboard vessels have been  proposed. Pingers are currently used to warn cetaceans away from shark  nets installed to protect bathers in Australia (Department of  Environment 2019).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici<em>&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durant<em> et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003, Mills <em>et al. </em>2004, Cooper <em>et al. </em>2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall<em> et al. </em>2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker <em>et al. </em>2003c, Durant <em>et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir<em> et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis<em> et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe<em> et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al. </em>1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen <em>et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies <em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa,<em> A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel<em> et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for <em>A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase <em>et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50652196,8542,Felis nigripes,Vulnerable,C2a(i),2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This assessment is based on the national Red List assessment for South Africa (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Black-footed Cats are endemic to the arid regions of southern Africa, occurring widely across the western reaches in a relatively restricted and patchy distribution. The historical paucity of data has led to inconsistencies and perpetuated inaccuracies in current literature, which in turn has affected the accuracy of conservation measures. The naturally rare, cryptic colouring, small size and secretive nocturnal nature of this species has contributed considerably to the lack of information. Black-footed Cats are known to occur at low densities and it is difficult to establish population sizes. The stronghold of the species is suspected to be in the central Karoo region of South Africa where highest densities are reached, whereas other regions are suspected to have medium or low densities. Using density estimates of 0.03 km², 0.02 km² and 0.01 km² for high, medium and low density areas respectively, we converted kernel densities to isopleths to calculate population size. Estimated population size is 13,867 individuals, of which 9,707 are considered to be mature (using a 70% mature population structure), where no subpopulation is suspected to comprise more than 1,000 mature individuals as the species is patchily distributed. However, defining subpopulations for this species needs further work. We also caution that these estimates will be confounded by uneven sampling across the range, thus leading to inaccurate density isopleths. This is a first attempt and should be refined as more data from across the range become available.<br/><br/>There is a general suspected continuing decline from to loss of prey base due to bushmeat poaching (especially Springhare <em>Pedetes capensis</em>), persecution (direct or incidental), road collisions and predation by domestic animals. Continuing decline is also inferred from a long-term study in Benfontein, Northern Cape where estimated density declined from 0.17 cats / km² in 1998–1999 to 0.08 cats / km² in 2005–2015. Additionally, <em>c.</em> 50% of radio-collared individuals are lost annually to a combination of natural mortality and predation from abundant Black-backed Jackals (<em>Canis mesomelas</em>) and Caracals (<em>Caracal caracal</em>). An emerging threat may be increasing interspecific competition, including intraguild predation, by overabundant mesopredators (for example, Black-backed Jackals <em>Canis mesomelas</em>).<br/><br/>Thus, we list this species as Vulnerable C2a(i), as population size is estimated to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, where no subpopulation is suspected to be more than 1,000 mature individuals, and there is an inferred continuing decline. We note that this is a precautionary assessment given the low density estimates used in the analysis, the lack of systematic field surveys across the range and the lack of a robust subpopulation definition. This species should be reassessed once such data are available. Key interventions include the establishing of large conservancy areas and sustaining viable Springhare subpopulations in areas where alternative refuge systems are unavailable.","The Black-footed Cat is one of the world's smallest cats, with females weighing an average of 1.3 kg and males larger at 1.93 kg (Sliwa 2013). The conspecific and more common African Wildcat (<em>Felis silvestris)</em> is considerably larger (females - 3.9 kg, males - 5.1 kg) (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Unlike most cat species, these cats are predominantly ground-dwellers and will not readily take to trees. They lead a solitary existence except when with kittens or during brief mating periods. Black-footed Cats are extremely secretive in nature. They are strictly crepuscular and nocturnal and are active throughout the night, even hunting at temperatures of -8˚ C (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997). During the day, the cats make use of dens. The species prefers hollowed out abandoned termite mounds when available (especially for the kittens), but will use dens dug by other animals such as Springhares, Ground Squirrels (<em>Xerus inauris</em>) and Aardvark (<em>Orycteropus afer</em>). It is a specialist of open, short grass areas with an abundance of small rodents and ground-roosting birds. It inhabits dry, open savannah, grasslands and Karoo semi-desert with sparse shrub and tree cover and a mean annual rainfall of between 100 and 500 mm at altitudes up to 2,000 m above sea level. It is not found in the driest and sandiest parts of the Namib and Kalahari Deserts (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats mate year round but with a distinct season from late winter (August) over the summer months up to March. Up to two litters a year may be produced, with one to four kittens (normally two) born after 63–68 day gestation inside a Springhare burrow or hollow termitarium (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997, Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Births are timed to coincide with rains and food availability. Kittens are independent after 3–4 months, but remain within the range of their mother for extended periods (Sliwa 2013). Whilst they are reported to live up to 16 years in captive situations, life expectancy in the wild is about five years (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data), although two monitored individuals lived at least seven years (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>As with most small cat species, Black-footed Cats are obligate carnivores. During a 6-year field study on the game farm in central South Africa, 1,725 prey items were observed consumed by 17 free-ranging habituated individuals (Sliwa 2006). Average prey size was 24.1 g. Eight males fed on significantly larger prey (27.9 g) than 9 females (20.8 g). Fifty-four prey species were classified by their average mass into eight different size classes, three for mammals, three for birds, one for amphibians/reptiles, and one for invertebrates. Small mammals (5–40 g) constituted the most important prey class (39%) of total prey biomass followed by larger mammals (&gt; 100 g, 17%) and small birds (&lt; 40 g, 16%). Mammals and birds pooled comprised 72% and 26% of total prey biomass, respectively, whereas invertebrates and amphibians/reptiles combined constituted just 2% of total prey mass consumed. Heterotherm prey items were unavailable during winter, when larger birds and mammals (&gt; 100 g) were mainly consumed. Small rodents like the Large-eared Mouse (<em>Malacothrix typica</em>), captured 595 times by both sexes, were particularly important during the reproductive season for females with kittens. Males showed less variation between prey size classes consumed among climatic seasons. This sex-specific difference in prey size consumption may help to reduce intra-specific competition (Sliwa 2006). In terms of interspecific competition, Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2010) found that Black-footed Cats captured smaller prey on average than African wildcats, although both captured approximately the same number (12-13) of prey animals per night.<br/><br/>Of 17 radio-collared Black-footed Cats (7 males, 10 females) studied at game farm at Benfontein Game Farm, Northern Cape Province from 1997 to 1998, the home ranges of adult resident males averaged 16.1–20.7 km² while those of females were 8.6–10 km², where male home range overlapped with females’ by 60–67% (Sliwa 2004). Despite this overlap, all individuals hunt solitarily. Similarly, annual home range sizes of black-footed cats were 7.1 km² for an adult female, and 15.6 and 21.3 km² for two adult males monitored at Benfontein Game Farm, Northern Cape Province from 2006 to 2008 (Kamler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).Since range size is dependent on available prey resources, in more arid regions these home ranges can be considerably larger. Both sexes spray mark, particularly during mating season when they are deployed in proportion to intensity of use and may play a role in social spacing (Molteno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998, Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Adults travel an average of 8.42±2.09 km per night – more distance than the African Wildcat (5.1±3.4 km per night) despite their smaller size (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).","Following 22 years of research effort by the Black-footed Cat Working Group, the threats to the species have become more apparent (Wilson 2016). Additional and previously unknown threats including, but not limited to, intraguild predation, diseases, declining Springhare&#160; populations and unsuitable farming practices have now been realised. All of these suggest that the species is becomingly increasingly threatened. New distribution data clearly indicate that the majority of the distribution occurs outside of formally protected areas (Figure 1 in&#160;Supporting Material). Indeed, the majority of protected areas are suspected to be too small to adequately conserve a viable subpopulation. Essentially, this means the conservation of the species relies on the cooperation of private landowners and managers, particularly in large conservancy areas. However, whilst the geographical distribution of the species may be greater than previously documented, the actual occurrence of the species is highly fragmented and patchy within this area (Wilson 2016), which may have resulted in the creation of island subpopulations resulting in limited dispersal opportunities and restricting genetic exchange between subpopulations. Habitat loss or changes have previously been considered the most severe threat to the species. Habitat degradation that results in the loss of prey base is a serious threat, but changing agricultural practices may, in some instances, actually benefit the species by providing artificially high rodent populations for prey and fewer apex carnivores to compete with.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most serious long-term threat for Black-footed Cats is the loss of key resources, such as den sites and prey, from anthropogenic disturbance or habitat degradation (for example from overgrazing). They are unable to create or maintain their own dens or burrows and rely on those made by other species. Thus, the localised removal of a sympatric species, Springhare or ground squirrels with whom they have a commensal (inquilistic) relationship, may be detrimental to their continued existence in a region (B. Wilson unpubl data., Olbricht and Sliwa 1987, Sliwa 2013). Springhares are often considered as a problem or damage-causing species requiring some control measures by farmers. Although a rodent, Springhares are long-lived with a slow reproductive rate and they do not recover easily from a severe reduction in numbers. In Botswana, the unregulated subsistence hunting of the Springhares for bushmeat has resulted in the eradication of the species in some regions (Butynski 1973, 2013), and with them in all likelihood the Black-footed Cats (Wilson 2016). Bushmeat hunting may be increasing in both scope and scale within southern African savannas (Lindsey <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/><br/>The impact of mesopredators may be increasing across South African rangelands (Avenant and du Plessis 2008). In general, numbers of Black-footed Cats and other larger carnivores are negatively related due to intraguild predation. Annually, the BFCWG loses about 50% of all radio-collared cats to larger predators (BFCWG unpubl. data). The BFCWG believes that the most vulnerable individuals (kittens and subadults – below 1 kg) are the more likely victims of predation but since these individuals are difficult to monitor (too small to fit a radio collar) the actual rate of loss is unknown.&#160; Similarly, during a study over 2006–2008 on Benfontein Farm, Northern Cape Province, two Black-footed Cats were killed by predation, at least one was from Black-Backed Jackals (Kamler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Wilson 2016) and another by a Caracal (Wilson 2016). Thus, although Black-footed Cats can co-exist with Black-Backed Jackals by using burrows during the day (see above for synergistic interaction) and also taking refuge in them at night during danger (A. Sliwa pers. obs.), and by partitioning activity and diets (Kamler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015), increasing Black-backed Jackal abundance caused by anthropogenic disturbance and loss of apex predators is likely to increase Black-footed Cat mortality. The BFCWG also has evidence of cats killed by traditional herding dogs and the popularity of Anatolian shepherd dogs with sheep farmers is potentially a new emerging threat (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats are also lost through indirect persecution, such as accidental poisonings (for example locust spraying, predator control lures/baits) and general predator persecution throughout most of their range in South Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sliwa 2013). Recently, there has been an increased interest for this species in the trophy industry as witnessed by permit applications and requests made to taxidermists (Wilson 2015).<br/><br/>The extent of road mortality on cat subpopulations is not known. The incident rate recorded in the Endangered Wildlife Trust road collision database is limited to a few records (W. Collinson unpubl. data). However, only 3% out of 790 locality records were road collision casualties (Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>Although an inherited trait, and previously thought to be limited only to inbred captive populations, Black-footed Cats show a high prevalence for AA-amyloidosis. (Olbricht and Sliwa 1987 and Terio <em>et al.</em> 2008). This is a disease characterised by fibrillar protein depositions in many organs as a result of chronic inflammatory processes usually culminating in renal failure. About 70% of the documented deaths of captive cats internationally are as a result of this disease. However, the presence of amyloid in free-ranging subpopulations was detected by Terio <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2008) from samples provided by the BFCWG. This provides additional evidence for a species predilection and supports the existence of a possible familial type of amyloidosis in the species. Habitat fragmentation and subpopulation isolation can only exacerbate this disease at subpopulation levels, whilst at the same time, the disease is a major reason why currently global captive breeding programmes are not self-sustainable (A.Sliwa pers. comm.). As wild subpopulations become genetically isolated, reduced genetic variability threatens population viability by increasing susceptibility to disease and reducing reproductive fitness. An additional consequence of habitat fragmentation and population isolation is increased contact with other carnivores and the pathogens they carry. Because Black-footed Cats share their territory, prey base, and infectious disease susceptibility with many small carnivores, and even domestic dogs and cats, this provides numerous opportunities for disease transmission (Lamberski <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats are also vulnerable to natural disasters such as flooding of dens and den collapses (Sliwa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). The long-term effects of climate change cannot be overlooked and may lead to changes in range, changes in timing of breeding events, increases in severe weather such as flooding and droughts, as well as increased disease patterns or risks of the spread of pathogens from parasites.<br/><br/>Fortunately, unlike the African Wildcat, this species does not hybridize easily with other cat species. The only confirmed hybrid cases (Black-footed Cats and domestic cats) were under captive conditions (Leyhausen 1979). None have been recorded from the wild (A. Sliwa and B. Wilson pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Current habitat trend: Previously believed to be restricted mostly to panveld and short grass areas, Black-footed Cats occupy a wide range of open arid and semi-arid habitats where they favour any vegetation cover that is low and not too dense, where they have even been sporadically recorded on fallow agricultural fields and in extremely overgrazed areas (Wilson 2016). They are therefore not restricted by habitat throughout most of their distribution in southern Africa. However, overgrazing from livestock farms leads to bush encroachment which reduces the habitat suitability for their normal prey items. The species is highly adaptable and reports of individuals utilising open agricultural areas suggests that the cats may respond to seasonal fluctuations of rodent populations associated with sowing and harvesting activities. However, given the unpredictable nature of these events, and associated risks due to the proximity to humans and their domestic carnivores, the benefit to resident cats is uncertain.&#160; Also there is no research as to how these human-dominated landscapes are used by Black-footed cats and whether these specific records are due to the fact that they are exposed and highly frequented by human observers (A. Sliwa pers. obs.).","The Black-footed Cat is naturally rare compared to the other small cats of southern Africa (Sliwa 2013). Camera trapping for this species is particularly difficult due to secretive behaviour and small size. For example, in over 790 records, only one was from a camera trap (B. Wilson unpubl. data). Black-footed Cats move quickly and do not habitually use game tracks or roads like other animals. Since 2006, there has been extensive effort to establish the historical and current distribution of the species (Wilson 2016). Prior to 2000, there are only 251 specimen records including fossil specimens were available for the species. Since then, more than 545 records have been collected with an emphasis on locality data have been recorded. It is now clear that the species has been previously under-sampled. Throughout its entire range there are only <em><em><em><em><em>c.</em></em></em></em></em> 692 verifiable locality records which can be reliably mapped (Wilson 2016). As such, it is difficult to determine density, and thus a population estimate, for this species. High-density estimates come from two study sites at Benfontein and Nuwejaarsfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa with over 17,000 fixes and 1,600 hours of observation of radio-collared individuals (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010): For Benfontein, between 1998 and 1999, density (based on radio-collared individuals) was estimated at 0.17 cats / km² but only 0.08 km² between 2005 and 2014. For Nuwejaarsfontein, density was estimated at 0.06 cats / km² from 2009-2014 (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>, 2014). However, these two sites may represent exceptionally high densities due to favourable climate and human management, and low-quality habitat densities are probably much lower (Sliwa 2013). Thus, we suspect that densities of 0.03 / km² represent more realistic higher densities across larger scales and represent viable subpopulations in the long-term (B. Wilson and A. Sliwa unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Using these density estimates, population size was calculated by converting kernel densities based on verified records (both historical and recent) to high (0.03 cats / km²), medium (0.02 cats / km²) and low density (0.01 cats / km²) isopleths in ArcGIS across the entire range of the species in the assessment region. The population sizes from the density bands were then summed to produce an overall population estimate. The best estimate yielded an estimated 13,867 individuals within the assessment region, of which 9,707 are mature (assuming a 70% mature population structure, Table 1). These estimates were calculated from the range-wide heat map (Figure 1 in Supporting Material). See Supporting Material attachment also for more details on methodology.<br/><br/>Additionally, no subpopulation is suspected to have more than 1,000 mature individuals. However, the definition of a subpopulation for this species needs further work depending on dispersal rates and distances, connectivity and genetic subpopulation structure, although small home range sizes of the species – minimum estimate for females 7.1–8.6 km² (Sliwa 2004, Kamler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) – may suggest small subpopulation sizes. Unpublished data suggest dispersal distance so 20 km (A. Sliwa unpubl. data), and we suspect that clusters within 50 km of each other and distances of 100 km apart would separate subpopulations. This would mean a cluster within an area of 1,963 km² or 2,500 km² would yield subpopulation sizes of 334 and 425 individuals (using 0.17 cats / km²) respectively.<br/><br/>These estimates of course suffer from lack of consistent search effort and thus density zones may be confounded by field surveys that differ in methodology and single records may represent substantially higher density areas, reflecting the lack of field surveys conducted in the region. As such, population estimates are likely to be underestimates. This may especially be the case for the global estimate, as areas outside South Africa may be significantly under-sampled, although it is likely that these areas exhibit lower densities anyway (M. Küsters, pers. comm. for Namibia). Given that the South African core of the range is fairly well-sampled, the population estimate is likely to be more robust and the analysis represents a replicable first-step methodology that can be improved with further field surveys and ecological studies. It should also be noted that estimates of population sizes are sensitive to the relative size of the high-density clusters, thus a more conservative estimate would yield a lower population size, while a less conservative estimate would yield a larger population size. For example increasing the high-density isopleth to cover 70% of the records (up from 50%), yields a global population estimate of 16,853 individuals (11,797 mature). We also note that the density estimates used for the isopleths are precautionary and replicated studies in different regions should be conducted to properly calibrate the density bands.<br/><br/>There is a higher density in the central part of South Africa, along a North-South axis with decreasing frequency of records either West or East of this region and northwards in the range (Figure 1 in&#160;Supporting Material&#160;).<br/><br/>A decline is suspected over the general range, with only some central areas indicating stable subpopulations. However, it is difficult to demonstrate decline in a species that is so hard to census. Preliminary evidence for inferring a continuing decline comes from the long-term study area Benfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, where the density in years 1998–1999 was 0.17 cats / km² (Sliwa 2004), and over the past 10 years (2005–2015) was only 0.08 cats / km², which is documented in field reports (for example, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Local subpopulations may also be low or even absent in areas where Black-backed Jackals and Caracal are abundant due to interspecific competition, including intraguild predation (but see Kamler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015), which may be especially true of juveniles. About 50% of all radio collared cats are lost to larger predators (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data). The Black-footed Cat is naturally rare compared to the other small cats of southern Africa (Sliwa 2013). Camera trapping for this species is particularly difficult due to secretive behaviour and small size. For example, in over 790 records, only one was from a camera trap (B. Wilson unpubl. data). Black-footed Cats move quickly and do not habitually use game tracks or roads like other animals. Since 2006, there has been extensive effort to establish the historical and current distribution of the species (Wilson 2016). Prior to 2000, there are only 251 specimen records including fossil specimens were available for the species. Since then, more than 545 records have been collected with an emphasis on locality data have been recorded. It is now clear that the species has been previously under-sampled. Throughout its entire range there are only <em><em><em><em><em>c.</em></em></em></em></em> 692 verifiable locality records which can be reliably mapped (Wilson 2016). As such, it is difficult to determine density, and thus a population estimate, for this species. High-density estimates come from two study sites at Benfontein and Nuwejaarsfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa with over 17,000 fixes and 1,600 hours of observation of radio-collared individuals (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010): For Benfontein, between 1998 and 1999, density (based on radio-collared individuals) was estimated at 0.17 cats / km² but only 0.08 km² between 2005 and 2014. For Nuwejaarsfontein, density was estimated at 0.06 cats / km² from 2009-2014 (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). However, these two sites may represent exceptionally high densities due to favourable climate and human management, and low-quality habitat densities are probably much lower (Sliwa 2013). Thus, we suspect that densities of 0.03 / km² represent more realistic higher densities across larger scales and represent viable subpopulations in the long-term (B. Wilson and A. Sliwa unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Using these density estimates, population size was calculated by converting kernel densities based on verified records (both historical and recent) to high (0.03 cats / km²), medium (0.02 cats / km²) and low density (0.01 cats / km²) isopleths in ArcGIS across the entire range of the species in the assessment region. The population sizes from the density bands were then summed to produce an overall population estimate. The best estimate yielded an estimated 13,867 individuals within the assessment region, of which 9,707 are mature (assuming a 70% mature population structure, Table 1 in Supporting Material&#160;). These estimates were calculated from the range-wide heat map (Figure 1 in ). See&#160;Supporting Material&#160;&#160;attachment also for more details on methodology.<br/><br/>Additionally, no subpopulation is suspected to have more than 1,000 mature individuals. However, the definition of a subpopulation for this species needs further work depending on dispersal rates and distances, connectivity and genetic subpopulation structure, although small home range sizes of the species – minimum estimate for females 7.1–8.6 km² (Sliwa 2004, Kamler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) – may suggest small subpopulation sizes. Unpublished data suggest dispersal distance so 20 km (A. Sliwa unpubl. data), and we suspect that clusters within 50 km of each other and distances of 100 km apart would separate subpopulations. This would mean a cluster within an area of 1,963 km² or 2,500 km² would yield subpopulation sizes of 334 and 425 individuals (using 0.17 cats / km²) respectively.<br/><br/>These estimates of course suffer from lack of consistent search effort and thus density zones may be confounded by field surveys that differ in methodology and single records may represent substantially higher density areas, reflecting the lack of field surveys conducted in the region. As such, population estimates are likely to be underestimates. This may especially be the case for the global estimate, as areas outside South Africa may be significantly under-sampled, although it is likely that these areas exhibit lower densities anyway (M. Küsters, pers. comm. for Namibia). Given that the South African core of the range is fairly well-sampled, the population estimate is likely to be more robust and the analysis represents a replicable first-step methodology that can be improved with further field surveys and ecological studies. It should also be noted that estimates of population sizes are sensitive to the relative size of the high-density clusters, thus a more conservative estimate would yield a lower population size, while a less conservative estimate would yield a larger population size. For example increasing the high-density isopleth to cover 70% of the records (up from 50%), yields a global population estimate of 16,853 individuals (11,797 mature). We also note that the density estimates used for the isopleths are precautionary and replicated studies in different regions should be conducted to properly calibrate the density bands.<br/><br/>There is a higher density in the central part of South Africa, along a North-South axis with decreasing frequency of records either West or East of this region and northwards in the range (Figure 1).<br/><br/>A decline is suspected over the general range, with only some central areas indicating stable subpopulations. However, it is difficult to demonstrate decline in a species that is so hard to census. Preliminary evidence for inferring a continuing decline comes from the long-term study area Benfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, where the density in years 1998–1999 was 0.17 cats / km² (Sliwa 2004), and over the past 10 years (2005–2015) was only 0.08 cats / km², which is documented in field reports (for example, Sliwa <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Local subpopulations may also be low or even absent in areas where Black-backed Jackals and Caracal are abundant due to interspecific competition, including intraguild predation (but see Kamler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015), which may be especially true of juveniles. About 50% of all radio collared cats are lost to larger predators (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data).",Decreasing,"Black-footed Cats have the most restricted distribution of any of the African felid species (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species is endemic to the arid grasslands, dwarf shrub, and savannah of the Karoo and Kalahari in southern Africa. The majority of the range occurs within the boundaries of South Africa, thinning out northwards into Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe (Table 1). The species is found primarily in Namibia and South Africa, but also Botswana (where there are historical records but only limited recent ones), marginally in Zimbabwe and likely marginally in extreme southern Angola (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>In South Africa, where the majority of research effort has taken place, recent records suggest range expansions in virtually all directions from previous literature (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2016.). It is unlikely that true range extensions have occurred but is rather an artefact of reporting bias as a result of recently increased citizen scientist reports combined with increased research effort (Wilson 2016). On the eastern side of its range, occurrence records are confirmed to just west of the Kruger National Park, into north-western KwaZulu-Natal, and new data suggest that the species occurs further south and south-westwards in the Southern Cape and more westwards in the Northern Cape than previously realised (Wilson 2016). The occurrence of the species in Swaziland (M. Reilly and A. Monadjem pers. comm. 2014) and Lesotho (N. Avenant pers. comm. 2014) is considered highly unlikely and certainly no records exist to date.<br/><br/>Apart from Addo Elephant National Park and Mountain Zebra National Park in the Eastern Cape Province, and SA Lombard Nature Reserve in North West Province, there appears to be no consistent sightings of Black-footed Cats in formally protected areas, despite considerable research effort and game drive reporting (Wilson 2016). This is likely due to unsuitable habitat or the presence of a higher density of mesopredators which increases competition and incidences of intraguild predation. They probably occur in Karoo National Park. However, further field surveys are needed to determine in which protected areas subpopulations of the species are resident.<br/><br/>The current extent of occurrence in South Africa is roughly about 930,000 km² (Wilson 2016). However, we suspect that area of occupancy is considerably lower, due to sensitivity to environmental disturbances and threats (Sliwa 2013).","The Black-footed Cat is accidentally killed in indiscriminate trapping, hunting (rifle and dogs) and poisoning events aimed at other damage-causing carnivores. However, as a protected species these incidents are never reported for fear of persecution (Wilson 2016). At least one specimen record reported to B. Wilson was of a Khoisan man in the Kalahari wearing a skin as part of a loincloth. He indicated that he obtained the skin from a roadkill from the neighbouring Botswana area. Similarly, there are anecdotal reports of skins in households in the central Karoo (M. Drouilly pers. obs. 2014), Also, one flat skin was obtained from a sheep guard close to Biesjiesfontein in the Victoria West area in 2012, likely killed by his hunting dogs (A. Sliwa pers. obs. 2012).<br/><br/>Applications have been made for legal hunting permits in the Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, but have never been granted. However, several South Africa taxidermists have acknowledged having mounted hunted animals (Wilson 2016), indicating that there is some interest in the hunting industry for the species.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, there was a demand for the species by overseas zoos and export permits were granted for cats to be caught and exported from the Eastern Cape Province. During further investigations, it was revealed that many of these cats actually came from the then-Cape Province (now part of the Northern Cape Province) (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997). More recently, it has become an acknowledged fact that this species does not thrive in captivity and the demand for wild-caught individuals has diminished considerably (Sliwa and Schürer 2006). Zoos now maintain and exchange animals between institutions. To increase genetic diversity in these captive populations, in vitro fertilisation attempts have been made using oocytes of a captive females and semen collected from a wild-caught male during annual field research trips conducted by the Black-footed Cat Working Group (Herrick <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010), but without generating a viable embryo. <br/><br/>Whilst even predator-proof fencing is not an effective barrier for black-footed cats, the effects of wildlife ranching are currently unknown and further research is required to conclusively determine if this land-use practice differs from other farming practices. Since larger carnivores are often introduced and managed, the presence of these is likely to have a negative effect on Black-footed Cats due to intraguild predation. This is perhaps the reason why this species does not occur in formally protected wildlife areas like South Africa’s Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Kruger National Park but may be reported in peripheral areas. Effectively, large areas of intensive wildlife ranching could amplify the island habitat effect that already prevents movements between subpopulations, further threatening the species. This hypothesis should be tested.",Terrestrial,"Black-footed Cat presence in formally protected areas remains low to non-existent, particularly in those large enough to maintain subpopulations, for example, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. It is unclear in how many protected areas they occur. However, the major Karoo protected areas – Karoo, Mountain Zebra and Addo Elephant National Parks – may each protect a small but not self-sustaining population. Hunting of this species is banned in South Africa and Botswana and it is protected across most of its range excluding Namibia and Zimbabwe (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Although the Black-footed cat has been recorded at least marginally in all of the South African provinces, the effectiveness of local protection measures remains in question.<br/><br/>Key interventions for the species include:<br/><ol><li>Judicious management of larger predators and mesopredators: this is a holistic approach that includes only controlling true problem animals, ensuring that fields are not overgrazed or overstocked so as to sustain natural small mammal prey, and reintroducing or tolerating apex predators to roam and exert top down influences on mesopredators. The effect should be to reduce unnaturally high mesopredator density. Improved sheep-farming practices (for example, synchronised breeding events, kraaling at night, and shepherd systems, lethal control of only proven problem mesopredators) should also be trialled.</li><li>The establishment of large conservancy areas to create viable Black-footed Cat subpopulations and facilitate ecological separation between Black-footed Cats and larger carnivores (Kamler <em>et al.</em> 2015). The fragmentation of suitable habitats and potential isolation of subpopulations makes the formation or maintenance of dispersal corridors important in the prevention of inbreeding and prevalence of inherited diseases such as AA-amyloidosis. Despite its small size, individuals have very large home ranges, and to conserve subpopulations and create corridors, the emphasis should be on the establishment of large conservancy areas with suitable conditions for the species. This is particularly important in areas where the prospects of a formally protected area are unlikely.</li><li>Similarly, conservancies and private lands with low apex predator density can be targeted as possible sites for Black-footed Cat stewardship.</li><li>Human activities that lead to habitat degradation and the loss of prey species need to be addressed, particularly in the Karoo region which is likely to be the remaining stronghold region for the species.. This should also be achieved by creating awareness to the presence and needs of the species among landowners to reduce accidental persecution, whilst providing information about the special needs of Black-footed Cats that would enable them to be actively involved in the protection of the species.</li><li>This may also include generally raising public awareness of the cryptic species and encouraging citizen scientists to submit distribution records through the promotion of citizen science platforms. This has been done previously with the use of posters created by the BFCWG requesting the public to report sightings of the species, the bulk of the data having been used to establish a more accurate geographical distribution of the species (Wilson 2016).</li><li>Other interventions can involve applying stiffer legal penalties to people involved in deliberate persecution of the species or illegally keeping or trading with the species. </li></ol>In the long-term, the creation of a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species as an interim or pre-emptive conservation measure should be investigated which could be linked to the already existing international and national <em>ex situ</em> management plans. Currently there is no consistent and self-sustaining breeding and survival of cats in South African facilities and some only maintain their stocks by receiving rescued/confiscated individuals from the wild. We suggested the establishment of a national breeding studbook for Black-footed Cats, which would then allow a better overview on the stocks, which could then also feed to the international studbook, maintained by Wuppertal Zoo in Germany since 1991.<br/><br/><strong>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:</strong><br/><br/>Currently, there are no conservation plans for Black-footed Cats and the urgency to create such plans is undermined by the paucity of data at a national level. It is anticipated the numbers will decrease over the next 20 year period, but during this period, available data should give a clear picture as to the areas of range that are most affected, and the best possible interventions needed.<br/><ul><li>Currently, at an international level, due to its already low numbers, it is one of the species listed in the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Plan program developed in 1981. However, the as-yet undetermined subspecies status (<em>Felis n. nigripes</em> and <em>F. n. thomasi</em>) may undermine and place in jeopardy the international holdings and <em>ex situ</em> management strategies for the species as a whole. A number of zoo have captive individuals and an international stud book is maintained for the species. Success in captive conditions is fraught by failure of individuals to thrive due to their highly specialised needs and the effects of inbreeding and/or AA-amyloidosis. Thus, <em>ex situ</em> conservation efforts are not recommended.</li><li>Translocation of individuals without the monitoring of the released cats to determine survival rates is not advocated or advised as displaced individuals may suffer a high mortality rate. Systematic monitoring in areas identified as under-sampled should be established to improve population estimates and scan for stewardship sites.</li><li>The presence/absence of the species in formally protected areas must be ascertained.<br/></li></ul><strong>Research priorities:<br/></strong><br/>The Black-footed Cat has been extensively studied for more than 20 years near the Kimberley area, along the Free State-Northern Cape border. The Black-footed Cat Working Group focuses on the ecology, reproductive biology, geographical range, habitat preferences, health and conservation of the species. This provided information about the diet (Sliwa 2006, Sliwa <em>et al.</em> 2010), home range size and social organization (Sliwa 2004), ecological relationships between the species and other sympatric carnivores (Kamler <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160; More recently, the BFCWG extended this study to include farms south of De Aar, Northern Cape Province in a different habitat type with different farming practices in place. However, there is little information for elsewhere within its range and the following are considered research priorities:<br/><br/>Fine-scale distributional studies across the distributional range. This will hopefully lead to more accurate subpopulation estimates. Long-term monitoring of subpopulation trends are also needed throughout the species’ geographic range, particularly in ecologically distinct areas and under varying farming practices. Kitten mortality and survival rates also need to be quantified.<br/><br/><ul><li>Similarly, studies on changes in density across a spectrum of habitat quality are needed to refine conservation plans and subpopulation estimates. Fine-scale determination on what habitat characteristics and prey populations are required for female Black-footed Cats to successfully raise their kittens is also needed. </li></ul>The impacts and extent of persecution (both direct and indirect) and the efficacy of education and awareness programmes targeted at landowners.<br/><br/>Genetic investigation into the subspecies status is needed as the results may have conservation implications.<br/><ul><li>Investigation into causes and extent of AA-amyloidosis in wild populations.</li><li>The effects of Black-backed Jackals and Caracals, and possibly other apex carnivores, need to be quantified.</li><li>The degree of inquilism and dependence on Springhares burrow systems for refuge, and thus long-term survival of cats following of the removal of Springhare subpopulations, needs to be determined.</li><li>Studies into the dispersal abilities and survival of subadult Black-footed Cats in different habitats. Effects of electric fences on local movements and dispersal patterns must be understood to assess the effects of long-term geographical isolation on subpopulation structure. This will enable us to define and delineate subpopulations more accurately.</li><li>Monitoring of the success of re-introduced individuals into new areas with/without other individuals present.</li><li>The range and impact of transmittable diseases from sympatric carnivores on Black-footed Cats.</li><li>The numbers of Black-footed Cats being removed for the trophy industry.<br/></li></ul>Other research projects include:<br/><ul><li>WAZA Conservation Project 06016 - Cologne Zoo(Germany), McGregor Museum (Kimberley, South Africa), San Diego Zoo Safari Park (USA), Wuppertal Zoo (Germany) - <a href=""http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/overview/blackfooted-cat-research"">http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/overview/blackfooted-cat-research</a></li><li>Distribution and Conservation Status of the Black-Footed Cat Felis nigripes in Namibia <a href=""http://www.rufford.org/projects/martina_kusters"">http://www.rufford.org/projects/martina_kusters</a>.

50653881,54012637,Leopardus tigrinus,Vulnerable,A2c,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> has recently been split into two species:<em> L. tigrinus </em>and <em>L. guttulus</em> (Trigo <em>et al. </em>2013a). The present concept applies only to the former, distributed from North Eastern Brazil through the majority of northern South America to what seem as disjunct populations in Panama and the Central Cordillera of Costa Rica (Hunter and Barrett 2011, Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013a). <em>L. tigrinus</em> and <em>L. guttulus </em>show no evidence of ongoing gene flow, whereas <em>L. tigrinus</em> and Pampas cat (<em>L. colocolo</em>) have not developed complete intrinsic reproductive barriers, which has allowed them to hybridize (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as <em>L. t. oncilla</em> also represents a different species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999, Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2008). <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> is widespread and rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and mist forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannas and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno<em> et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, densities are also very low, typically around 0.01–0.05/km<sup>2</sup> (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, 2013). In the Amazon, the species' occurrence might be marginal and restricted to some small isolated enclaves. The Northern Tiger Cat was absent from all of the extensive camera-trap studies that totalled 56,837 trap-days throughout all of the Amazon Basin and was considered the rarest carnivore there (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. unp. data). Abundance estimates of this small felid are lower than that reported for the much larger jaguar, puma and ocelot, and there is evidence suggestive of population fluctuations or declines of unknown reasons, in some areas, estimated at 10–40% (Oliveira 2011, unp. data). It has been suggested that high Ocelot population numbers negatively affect the Northern Tiger Cat population (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Probably most of the population of <em>L. tigrinus</em> occurs outside protected areas, and outside the Amazon basin lowland rainforest (Oliveira 2011), in habitats which are undergoing variable rates of loss due to habitat conversion to agriculture. Extreme examples include the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga (with losses of 50% or more depending on the source; Klink and Machado 2005, IBAMA/MMA 2011a, CI 2012) and the Brazilian Amazon (with deforestation of more than 20%/10,000km<sup>2</sup>/yr in recent years; Morton<em> et al. </em>2006) and an overall loss of 90% of cloud forest in the northern Andes (Bubb <em>et al.</em> 2004, Garavito <em>et al. </em>2012). Loss of habitats from conversion to agricultural lands is certainly its main threat to survival also in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the deforestation frontier of the Amazon basin. Other threats include retaliatory hunting from depredation on poultry and the skin and pet trade, competition and disease spread by domestic dogs, and road kills (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2013, Marinho 2015). There is also hybridization with Pampas Cat in central/northeastern Brazil, which may be a natural or anthropogenic process whose extent as a threat is unknown (Trigo <em>et al</em>. 2013a). If further taxonomic species splits are indeed confirmed, the sub-populations are to be even smaller.&#160;High rates of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation in Brazil (Klink and Machado 2005, Morton <em>et al. </em>2006) depict habitat suppression, not degraded habitat, which should reflect equivalent species population declines, for example. The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> and <em>L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup> of the total current available habitat (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many Areas; IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). A Population in semi-arid Caatinga scrub/dry forest mosaic area in Bahia State, Brazil, showed an observed abundance reduction of 25.9% from 2012 to 2015 (L. P. de Castro Meira, T. G. de Oliveira, pers. comm.). The decline of the Northern Tiger Cat over three generations was modelled with a maximum entropy algorithm for 52 <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em><span id=""yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466593628142_10605""> records in Colombia and 19 bioclimatic variables and found a 12.7% population loss over three generations for the species (i.e. 15 years). The decline for Brazil, which holds the majority of the species range, was estimated at 36.8% in three generations (Oliveira et al. 2013, MMA/IBAMA 2014). Including a stable population for Central America the&#160;overall reduction&#160;is estimated to&#160;be 31.7%. The species is therefore classified as Vulnerable VU A2c. The overall range-wide population size is estimated to be less than 10-11,000 individuals, the species will continue to decline, and there is a lack of conservation actions destined to the species.</p>","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, from the lowland semi-arid Caatinga to cloud forests in the Andes. In Costa Rica the species is almost entirely confined to montane forests along the flanks of volcanoes and other high mountains from 1,000 m up to the treeline (paramo) and occupy cloud forest and high elevation elfin forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). Their distribution pattern in Costa Rica and Panama closely resembles that of the oak (<em>Quercus</em> sp.) dominated forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). While in Central America and parts of northern South America it may be most common in montane cloud forest, it is mostly found in lowland areas in Brazil, being reported from rainforests to dry deciduous forest, savannahs, semi-arid thorny scrub, in both pristine and disturbed areas. However, the species appears absent in the llanos but present from a few records from Rupununi savannahs in Guyana (Payán pers. obs.). In disturbed habitats, it can occur even close to human settlements, as long as there is natural cover and prey base (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2008). However, Marinho (2015) has shown that the species' occurrence is favoured by denser woody cover and distance from rural settlements in the dry Caatinga of northeast Brazil. Although it can be found in a few and localized areas of the Amazon Basin (Oliveira 2004), the use of lowland Amazonian forests is practically unknown and requires research attention. After an enormous effort of 56,837 camera trap-days, at 12 different study sites throughout the Basin, no record of the species was obtained (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> unp. data).<br/><br/>The Northern Tiger Cat is a poorly known small-sized (2.4 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.12 kittens (1–4) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is mostly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. However, it could also be highly diurnal in some areas of Brazil. <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> diet is still very poorly studied, but is known to be based on small mammals (&lt; 100 g; Trigo et al. 2013b), birds and reptiles (especially lizards). Limited data on home range shows that they are much larger than would be expected by its small body size. It ranges from 1 to 17 km² (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2010). Northern Tiger Cats are typically rare to uncommon, occurring at low population densities throughout most of its range, especially on what would be expected by a felid of its size. Densities are typically 1-5/100 km², but can reach 15-25/100 km² in a few and localized areas where ocelots are either rare or absent (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010). Its numbers/densities are strongly negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intraguild predator/competitor (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2008, 2010; Oliveira 2011).","The Tiger Cats were heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline of the Ocelot trade (Payan and Trujillo 2006). Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, disease, road-kill, illegal trade (pets and pelts), retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2008, 2013; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; Diaz-Pulido <em>et al.</em> 2013; Marinho 2015). By and large, the greatest threat is the rampant rate of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation. In the Andes cloud forests deforestation is mostly due to conversion to agriculture but also includes oil, hydroelectric dams, urban sprawl and road building (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, CI 2012). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, suppression to agriculture is by far the main threat. In these domains the rate is actually higher in the area called MATOPIBA (the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia), where it is twice as high as in the other parts of the country and which also comprises the main and most important area for the species (IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Oliveira 2011). Thus, populations in the core range area of <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>range are getting ever increasingly reduced and fragmented. Change in native species dynamics (predator/competitor) could represent another previously undetected potential threat (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2013). Hybridization with Pampas cat in all of northeast and central Brazil (the main range area for <em>L. t. tigrinus</em>) was detected in 100% of all specimens evaluated. This may be a natural or anthropogenic process and the extent of this as a threat is unknown (Trigo<em> et al.</em> 2013a), but would probably already compromise about 70-80% of the entire species population, or even more. This high level of hybridization is unheard of for any extant cat species.","Relative abundance and estimated population densities vary greatly, and the northern<em> Leopardus tigrinus </em>is less abundant than the southern <em>Leopardus guttulus </em>and also the rarest of the tropical species of Neotropical cat (Oliveira 2011). <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>is rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and cloud forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannahs and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Amazon, density is very low, expected at approximately 0.01/100 km². Camera-trap surveys in other portions of its range indicate that the species generally occurs in densities between 1-5/100 km² or lower (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2010, 2013). In Central America the species rarely shows up in camera traps even where they are known to occur, suggesting that they either avoid traps or are naturally rare and elusive in that area (Schipper pers. comm.). A similar trend is also found in several areas in Brazil, where authors found it in most areas in intrinsically low numbers, and apparently those numbers are not owed to camera-trap shyness (Oliveira pers. comm.). The species was absent from all extensive camera-trap studies in the llanos of Colombia and all of the Amazon, depicting its extreme rarity there (Oliveira, Payán pers. comm.). The Northern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit possibly due to the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). It seems that where Ocelots are rare or absent the average population density of tiger cats ranges from 5-20 ind./100 km² but expected to be much lower than 5/100 km² where Ocelots are present (high density estimates, ca. 20/100 km², are obtained only in very few and isolated areas) (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> is classified as Vulnerable in Colombia (MAVDT 2005, Rodriguez-Mahecha<em> et al. </em>2006) and as Endangered in Brazil (IBAMA/MMA 2014). The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> and<em> L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km²&#160;of the total current available habitat (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>submitted, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many areas) (IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). Extrapolated population estimation based on the above distribution estimates and also estimated densities (0.01/km²), results in an expected total population size ranging from 8,932 to 10,208 adult individuals. Decline based on deforestation rates of the species’ habitat is certainly above 10% over the next decades (Morton <em>et al.</em> 2006, Mulligan 2010, Garavito<em> et al.</em> 2012). It seems that the savannahs of Mirador State Park and the complex of protected areas around Nascentes do Rio Parnaíba National Park in the Brazilian mid-north and the Andean protected areas in Colombia are the most important areas for the species conservation (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2014; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011).",Decreasing,"The distribution range of the Northern Tiger Cat expands from Costa Rica and Panama in Central America into South America up to Central Brazil. Its southern limits are not yet well known, as well as the extent of a possible overlap with the populations of the Southern Tiger Cat (<em>L. guttulus</em>) (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as <em>L. t. oncilla </em>also represents a different species (Johnson <em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Trigo<em> et al. </em>2008). Additionally, it is also possible that the northern South American population, described as <em>L. t. pardinoides,</em> will also comprise a separate species (Nascimento 2010), or be together with <em>L. t. oncilla</em>. from northwestern South America a clearly distinctive species from <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). There are records from the Amazon basin, but the distribution could be discontinuous and patchy, and the species extremely rare (Oliveira 2004). <em>L. tigrinus</em> has been described as one of the rarest species in Amazonia, being absent in all of the 12 extensive camera-trap studies assessed along all of the basin. Its occurrence there might be marginal and restricted to some enclaves (Oliveira unp. data). The species is absent from the Llanos (Payan<em> et al.</em> 2007) and from the Darien Peninsula connecting Central and South America. From Ecuador and Peru only few museum specimens exist and only in 2000 the species was formally confirmed in Bolivia through live-trapping. Although the Northern Tiger Cat has been collected as high as 4,800 m (Cuervo <em>et al. </em>1986), this is probably an outlier, as there are very few records at or slightly above 3,000 m (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). However, in Costa Rica, in the Chirripó National Park, the species was recorded at 3,625 m (González-Maya and Schipper 2008).&#160;In Colombia it seems to be restricted to elevation above 1,500 m, however in Brazil most of the records were below 500 m (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008). It seems that the bulk of the species' distribution would be the cloud forests of Costa Rica for <em>L. t. oncilla</em>, at 1,500-3,000 m in the northern Andes for <em>L. t. pardinoides</em>, and the dry-lands of the Cerrado and Caatinga domains and adjacent deciduous forest in north-central Brazil for<em> L. t. tigrinus</em>. All other areas seem to be marginal for the species (Oliveira unp. data/in prep.). Although the extent of occurrence is rather broad, the actual area of occupancy (AOO) is considerably restricted, especially because large portions of the high Andes, or of the Brazilian Cerrado (ca. 50%) and Caatinga (ca. 46%) have already been suppressed and converted to agriculture-pasture, where the species is known to be absent (Klink and Machado 2005; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008; IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; CI 2012). Thus, based on and using the remaining available cover estimates as the expected AOO (and compensating for inclusion of unsuitable areas and the tiny fragments), should be somewhere around 893,200–1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup>, and is continually declining (Morton <em>et al. </em>2006, Mulligan 2010). Additionally, if the Northern Tiger Cat tends to avoid the more open formations and proximity to rural settlements as Marinho (2015) reported for the Caatinga and Oliveira <em>et al</em>. (2014) noticed for the Cerrado, then the ""de facto"" AOO should be even smaller.",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. Hunting of the species is prohibited in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Suriname and Venezuela (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the Amazon, field records suggest that, where found, populations are extremely low - therefore these areas should not be perceived to be safeguards for the species as it is for other felids (Oliveira 2004). It is likely that the species presents only a marginal distribution there (Oliveira unp. data). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of higher Ocelot <em>(L. pardalis</em>) densities, so that conservation of Northern Tiger Cat populations should rely mostly on private lands (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). It has been estimated that possibly only one complex of protected areas could maintain in isolation a minimum viable population of this species (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2008, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). Further studies are required on the species' ecology, demographics, natural history, and threats. This species needs to be evaluated at the subspecies level due to genetic diversity within the species. A reassessment on the taxonomy of this species is an urgent research priority as the northern portion of the population might be a distinct species (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50654216,11511,Leopardus wiedii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Margay populations are declining through much of its range due to human induced conversion of native forest habitats to agriculture, pasture and infrastructure development, and is predicted to continue at a rate approaching (but less than) 30% over the next 18 years (three generations), which qualifies it as Near Threatened. However, several populations are considered threatened. Although the species shows a large extent of occurrence, its area of occupancy is much smaller. In Amazonia, which is often considered a stronghold for the species, estimates suggest that Margay is not as abundant as previously perceived, but rather uncommon (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Additionally, Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelots (through ‘the ocelot effect’), which are fairly abundant and the dominant felid species in most areas of tropical America, including protected areas (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, Margay conservation would concentrate outside protected areas and likely only in Amazonia could long-term viable populations be sustained. In most areas <em>L. wiedii</em> is typically rare to uncommon, reaching densities around 0.01–0.05/km² (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Bianchi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). Over the next 10 years it is predicted that degradation of the Amazon by roads, hydroelectric dams, fire and deforestation will fragment and isolate remaining populations of its main stronghold. Habitat loss and fragmentation in other biomes of occurrence is also impacting the remaining populations, where the species is much rarer than in Amazonia. Protected areas outside of the Amazon are not expected to retain viable populations over the next few years (and likely do not at present) (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). This species will likely qualify for VU A3cde in the near future and should be periodically reviewed.","The Margay is strongly associated with forest habitat/tree cover, from continuous forest to small forest fragments in savanna ecosystems, both evergreen and deciduous, although it has been occasionally reported outside forested areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Oliveira 1998, 2011). It seems to be absent from the semi-arid scrub of the Caatinga domain in Brazil, with the exception of some evergreen forest enclaves (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). This species is thought to be more arboreal and better adapted to live in trees than other cat species. It is perceived as being a little less tolerant of human settlement and altered habitat than its close relatives, the ocelot and tiger cat. Nevertheless, Margay will use highly disturbed forest, abandoned plantations and other agroforestry systems which provide sufficient tree cover (J. Schipper pers. comm., Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Margay is a small-sized (3.3 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.09 (1–2) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Activity pattern is predominately nocturno-crepuscular, with very few records of daytime activity. Prey base consists mostly of terrestrial and scansorial small mammals, but lizards and especially birds can comprise important items at some sites. Larger medium-sized mammals, like squirrels, rabbits, agoutis, and small monkeys are also taken, but to a lesser extent. The average prey size is around 250 g. Although Margay has high arboreal abilities, it hunts mostly on the ground and most prey recorded are terrestrial (Oliveira 1998, Wang 2002, Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Bianchi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).&#160; Given its arboreal capabilities there has been a recurring myth that this cat is either scansorial or arboreal. It indeed possesses several unique arboreal skills, but that does not necessarily make it arboreal per se. In fact, evidence is highly suggestive of terrestrial locomotion and hunting, but nevertheless with resting time notably up in trees (Oliveira 1998, Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The limited information on home range size varies from 1 to 20 km² (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Home range reported for Mexico was 4.1 km² for four males and 1 km² for a female (Carvajal-Villarreal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). The Margay occurs at low population densities throughout most of its range, and its numbers/densities are negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intra-guild predator/competitor (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).","The Margay has been one of the most heavily exploited Latin American cats decades ago. Margays began to appear in international trade at a time of concern over the level of exploitation of the Ocelot, and species of spotted cats in trade were rarely verified. Illegal hunting for domestic markets or for the underground skin trade has been reported to be a continuing a problem in some areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, roads, illegal trade (pets and pelts - animals sometimes enter the pet trade), and retaliatory killing (animals are often shot due to depredation on poultry). Populations, especially outside the Amazon basin, are severely fragmented and are being reduced by habitat conversion to plantations and pasture. The species is susceptible to disease outbreaks (in Tamaulipas, Mexico there is an ongoing threat from disease). In Brazil, populations of the Atlantic forest are more threatened than those of the Amazon (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).","This species is predominantly uncommon to rare throughout its range (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). In general, Margays occur at densities of 1-5 ind./100 km², but have been estimated as high as 15-25 ind./100 km² in a very few and highly localized areas (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Where Ocelots co-occur in densities &gt;10 ind./100 km², Margay densities are expected to be much lower than 5 per 100 km² (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). The Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit outside the Amazon basin possibly due to the “ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, viable populations are expected to occur mostly outside protected areas or where Ocelot numbers are low. With the exception of the Amazon mega-reserves, it is not expected to be adequately protected anywhere else. Margays are undergoing a continuing decline due primarily to habitat loss to deforestation (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007). Considered Vulnerable in Brazil (Tortato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) and Argentina (Diaz and Ojeda 2000), Near Threatened in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), Threatened in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2002), and in Costa Rica (MINAE).",Decreasing,"The Margay ranges from the tropical lowlands of Mexico south through Central America and the Amazon basin to southern Brazil and Paraguay (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its southernmost limits reaches northeastern Argentina, north-central Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil and northern Uruguay along riverine forest (Dotta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Tortato <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Its occurrence in the northeastern part of Brazil is restricted to the Atlantic Forest domain (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Tortato <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). It generally occurs from 0-1,500 m, however, it has rarely been recorded up to 3,000 m in the Andes (Oliveira 1994).

This species is protected across most of its range, with hunting and trade prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, likely because of the impact of the higher ocelot densities, thus conservation efforts should concentrate outside protected areas (Oliveira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Oliveira 2011).

50659951,15955,Panthera tigris,Endangered,A2abcd; C1,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Tiger is listed as Endangered under criterion A2abcd. Comparing a breeding recent range estimate (42 “source sites” totalling 90,000&#160; km² : Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b) to a 2006 total range estimate (1.1 million km² : Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) suggests a range decline much greater than 50% over the last three generations (7 x 3 = 21 years). As per IUCN guidelines (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2007, IUCN 2013), we calculated generation length at seven years based on approximate age of maturity (four years) plus half the length of the reproductive lifespan (six years) (based on Smith and McDougal 1991 and unpublished information). This decline continues and at least two of the source populations listed in Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010b) have apparently been lost (one from Lao PDR and one from Thailand). In 2006, it was believed that breeding populations existed in 13 countries, but now known breeding Tiger populations occur only in eight (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Russia).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). A comparison of these population estimates of the 1990s (many with little scientific rigour) to similar current ones (many of better quality; see Table 1 in attached Supporting Material) suggests a decline of about 50% (taking the upper bound of 7,000 as the number of mature individuals in 1993, using a precautionary approach, declining to approximately 3,500 in 2014), but differences in methodologies and accuracy make such comparisons uncertain. This declining trend is likely to persist in the face of continuing threats such as direct poaching, prey depletion and habitat degradation which continue in all range states. Although several sites in India and Nepal have indeed reported recent recoveries, population reductions may not be reversible in other areas where Tiger habitat itself has been lost. Given the uncertainties about future declines, criterion A4bcd is no longer used.<br/><br/>The Tiger is also listed as Endangered under criterion C1 because the population of mature individuals may be fewer than 2,500 individuals. Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a estimated 2,154 tigers in 42 protected source sites where there is evidence of breeding (two populations are since known to have been lost, as described above), and the numbers in Table 1 (see Supporting material) could be overestimated. Generally Tiger status outside the source sites is poor and large breeding populations are unlikely to exist. To ensure tiger persistence, large population sizes (implying highest possible densities) and high survival rates of breeding adult females are critical. Although well-protected tiger populations may achieve recruitment rates that can sustain annual losses from mortality and emigration of 20% or more (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006), some theoretical models suggest declines to extinction when annual mortality of breeding females exceeds 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). For the purposes of Red List assessment, the estimated population in Source Sites is a good proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers. This population has declined by over 20% during the last two generations (14 years); the decline continues and may not be reversible in all sites.<br/><br/>Previously, Tigers were also listed under criterion C2a(i), but we have removed this criterion because the population in the Western Ghats in India has increased to &gt;250 adults (Karanth unpublished data). Other subpopulations in Terai, Central India, and Russia may also have &gt;250 adults (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>See attached Supporting Material for alternative depictions of range and population details.","Tigers are found mainly in the forests of tropical Asia, although they historically occurred more widely in drier and colder climes. One subspecies, the Amur Tiger <em>P. t. altaica</em>, persists in the Russian Far East. Photos of Tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the Tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Tigers need to kill 50-60 large prey animals per year (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, like many large carnivores, preferred prey are key to successful reproduction and are those species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges. Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1–3 females, a common felid pattern of social organization. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - e.g., female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at about 400 km² (Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range from a maximum of 17-19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey are abundant (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2011, Soutyrina <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat and tonics is a primary threat to Tigers, which has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat, and continues at unsustainable rates. That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.<br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The thirteen Tiger Range Countries came together in an unprecedented pledge to double the world’s Tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Asian lunar calendar, with a goal of achieving at least 6,000 Tigers. This figure was based on a baseline global population of 3,200, agreed upon at a preparatory workshop held in Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2009; 3,200 Tigers was the IUCN Red List population estimate at that time. Since then, Tiger Range Countries have adjusted their baseline national Tiger estimates, finalized in the Global Tiger Recovery Program adopted at the International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010 (GTRP 2010).<br/><br/>The global Tiger estimate published in the 2010 Red List assessment of 2,154 tigers was an updated version of the estimate of Tiger numbers in source sites (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a). This was not a complete estimate of global Tiger numbers (for example, most Amur Tigers in Russia are found in unprotected areas), but justified because Tiger status outside the source sites is generally poor and poorly known. IUCN Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2010) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.” While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also “stress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.” Tigers require large populations to persist, and the survival rate of breeding adult females is a key parameter, with models suggesting population declines when mortality of breeding females rises over 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). The IUCN Guidelines advise that “mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.” Thus, for the purposes of the Red List assessment in 2010, the estimated population in the Source Sites was used as a proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers.<br/><br/>Due to extensive surveys using improved methodologies since this analysis, our understanding of tiger distribution and numbers is much improved, e.g., extensive camera trapping in Bhutan has demonstrated significant populations. Further, Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010a) ignored some important Tiger areas, e.g., thousands of square kilometres in Kerinci and Leuser National Parks known to contain breeding Tiger populations.&#160; Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates. However, because of differences in methodology, this can by no means be interpreted as an increase over the 2010 estimate of 2,154. Rather, it is a more complete counting. While Tiger numbers have increased in some areas in India (e.g. Western Ghats, Central India, and Corbett Landscapes in India), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey in Lao PDR is no longer considered a potential source site).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated, less rigorously, at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although to some extent the new numbers represent improved knowledge, it is clear that there have been substantial population declines, with Tigers all but eliminated from much of their recent forest range, particularly in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for further information about national Tiger population estimates.",Decreasing,"The Tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Over the past 100 years Tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Tigers inhabit less than 6% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Walston <em>et al.</em> 2010b), with a 42% decline since 2006. Breeding populations of Tigers are currently found in eight range states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. There is evidence of breeding in China and Myanmar between 2009 and 2014, though these populations are likely dependent on immigration from neighbouring countries. Tigers may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate Tiger range was carried out (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006) and China. While this was generally considered representative of current distribution, Tiger presence was confirmed in just 47% the TCUs, and 89% were scored as undergoing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and their prey.<br/><br/>This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, and in delineating Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual records of Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). TCLs were defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five Tigers, and Tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (again, roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41% decline from the range described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63), attributed primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007). Habitat loss due to deforestation was also to blame, notable particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake <em>et al</em>. 2010). In India, landscapes with Tigers found to be much smaller and more fragmented than in the original assessment (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63 and Figure 4.12).<br/><br/>Records of Tigers were collected over a ten-year period (1995–2004), a period which may have been too liberal for places like Cambodia which underwent a sharp rise in poaching pressure in the 1990s (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Appendix 6). While 53% of the TCU survey respondents reported evidence of Tiger breeding in the time period 1995–2004, out of over 2,500 point records collected in 2005, just 8% had confirmed evidence of breeding Tigers (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 11-17). Large areas of habitat were defined as Tiger landscapes based on suitability, but given data paucity on Tiger presence there were often few records of breeding and actual Tiger occupancy to substantiate these (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Figures 2.3 and 4.8).<br/><br/>A review of land management within Tiger Conservation Landscapes described the TCLs as “potential habitat for Tigers” and found only 21% of their area to be legally protected.&#160; Management effectiveness was generally poor in the protected areas, with regulatory, budgetary and enforcement constraints, and hunting cited as the main threat. Significant portions of the TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, oil and gas, minerals, etc.) (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Tiger range was revisited again in 2009, by which time the extent of the Tiger’s range collapse had become evident. “Vast areas of Southeast Asia [were] recently found to be void of Tigers and depleted of prey by hunters” (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a: 5). The exercise used a different methodology to prioritize areas for Tiger conservation.&#160; Source Sites were defined as areas with confirmed current presence of Tigers and evidence of breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. An extensive review of scientific literature as well as correspondence with Tiger scientists and protected area managers resulted in the identification of just 42 source sites totalling approximately 90,000 km².&#160; Many Southeast Asian countries, previously considered to have large areas with Tigers, were found, on the basis of extensive survey effort over the past decade or more, to have no healthy breeding populations. Since this publication, Lao PDR has lost its only source site, but Bhutan, originally listed as a country not containing source sites, has documented breeding populations. [See Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary material].<br/><br/>The map for this effort (Figure 1 in supplementary material) differentiates areas where breeding has been detected in the past five years (2009-2014), where Tigers, but no breeding have been detected in the past five years, areas surveyed where no Tigers were detected and areas not surveyed.&#160; Data include camera trap photos, DNA, and observations of Tigers and Tiger sign detected during scientific surveys.&#160; Unsurveyed areas were excluded from Tiger range.&#160; Figure 2 (attached Supporting Material)&#160; documents a 42% range decline since 2006, reflecting both real decline and improved knowledge from new and better surveys.","In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of Tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the Tiger to extinction (Nowell 2000). Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell 2007). Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu 2007). Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of Tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell 2007). In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of Tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching over 6,000. They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce Tiger products, and several have already engaged in illegal production of Tiger bone wine. Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of Tiger bone has decreased since China banned Tiger bone in 1993. Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu 2007). In 2008 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted a Decision stating that “Tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives” (CITES 2008).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for Tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure. But many Tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock. Conflict-killed Tigers can also feed into the illegal trade. Many Tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger poaching is driven by less by poverty and more by wealth (TRAFFIC 2008), which is putting expensive illegal Tiger products within reach of a rapidly growing group of potential consumers. TRAFFIC has documented rising levels of recent illegal trade within the Tiger range countries, with seizures and confiscations in 2007–2009 averaging the equivalent of approximately 150 Tigers per year (Verheij <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Interdictions represent just a fraction of the true level of illegal trade, indicating that Tigers are gravely imperilled by black market demand.",Terrestrial,"At a “Tiger Summit” held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13 Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP 2010). The goal is to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by 2022 through actions to: <br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats; <br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives; <br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade; <br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities; <br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and <br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range. <br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by Heads of State including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh, and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.<br/><br/>The future of Tiger range depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat. Within these landscapes, the most urgent need is to first secure the source sites—protected areas with viable Tiger populations—where most of the global Tiger population is now clustered, and many of which are currently too threatened to deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b).<br/><br/>Countries that do not currently support known breeding populations (Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) but still have large landscapes with suitable habitat, Tigers might still be recovered if government commitment to Tigers, staff capacity for law enforcement and legal frameworks for Tiger protection can be established (Lynam 2010), though reintroduction may be needed in some places.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50661611,18146,Prionailurus bengalensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread and relatively common species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although the island subspecies <em>P. b. iriomotensis </em>is assessed separately in the Red List because the population is small and isolated.&#160; Across its range, threats vary enormously by region, in the Western Ghats in India, for example, it is threatened by urbanisation (Seto <em>et al.</em> 2012), while in Viet Nam (Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2014ab) direct and indirect hunting are potentially causing large population declines. Across the majority of its range, however, this species appears to be stable and to readily use degraded forest (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2013) and even heavily modified habitats such as oil palm (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Yue <em>et al.</em> in press) and sugar cane plantations (Lorica and Heaney 2013). Consequently the Leopard Cat does not currently meet the criteria for any of the threatened categories. It is listed as Least Concern.","Leopard Cats can range up to 3,240 m asl (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010) and occur in a wide variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to temperate broadleaf and, marginally, coniferous forest, as well as shrub forest and successional grasslands. The northern boundary of its range is limited by snow cover, as the Leopard Cat does not occur in deep snow (but see Kerley and Bosienko 2013). It is not found in the cold steppe grasslands, and generally does not occur in arid, treeless areas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Leopard Cats occur commonly in dense secondary growth, including logged forest (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and have been found in Acacia (Giman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), oil palm (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Yue <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and sugarcane (Lorica and Heaney 2013) plantations. A camera trap study in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo found that both number of individuals and overall detections of Leopard Cats were higher in a small oil palm plantation with shorter distances to the nearest forest compared to a large plantation, suggesting that although Leopard Cats do use oil palm areas, forest habitat remains important (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It is still unknown how dependent Leopard Cats in oil palm plantations are on surrounding forest, or the maximum distances they will move into plantations, or even if plantations support stable populations. Leopard Cats can also live close to rural settlements. They are excellent swimmers, and have successfully colonized offshore islands throughout their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>From 20 radio-collared Leopard Cats in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) report mean home ranges of 12.7 km<sup>2</sup>, larger than that reported for other radio-collared Leopard Cats in Thailand (4.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) or on Borneo (roughly 3.0&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Rajaratnam 2007, Hearn and Ross, unpublished data) or Iriomote Island (Schmidt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) found no significant difference between the range sizes of males and females. They also found that habitat use was in proportion to occurrence. Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) report that Leopard Cats used oil palm plantations for hunting but forest fragments were important for resting and breeding. This was also seen in Sumatra, where Leopard Cats have been frequently recorded in remnant forest fragments in and amongst coffee plantations (McCarthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Murids have been shown to dominate the diet (Rabinowitz 1990, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Shehzad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Other small mammals, eels and fish have also been reported, as well as occasional scavenging of carrion (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Leopard Cat is predominantly nocturnal (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Lynam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), with crepuscular peaks in some areas (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) but some diurnal activity has been recorded (e.g. Saxena and Rajanshi 2014, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data).","In China, commercial exploitation has been heavy: hundreds of thousands of Leopard Cat skins per year were exported in the 1980s. Although commercial trade is now much reduced (Yu 2010) this species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution. In villages around Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, chicken depredation was frequently attributed to Leopard Cats, and commonly resulted in retribution killing of the species (McCarthy 2013). Island populations are small and seriously threatened in the Philippines and Japan. Leopard Cats can hybridize with domestic cats, as is shown by the popular domestic breed, the Bengal Cat although most of these exotic cats are now bred from Bengal Cat stock rather than wild crosses (TICA, The International Cat Association 2012). Hybridization in the wild has been reported, but is not considered a significant threat. Although this species is less dependent on forest cover than others, habitat loss and fragmentation is still a threat across most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) report population densities of 9.6, 12.4 and 16.5 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, from three selectively logged forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. They also found that population density increased with forest disturbance. A similar relationship with forest disturbance was found in the Western Ghats, India, but densities here were generally lower at 10.45 and 4.48 individuals/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;from Badhra and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserves, respectively (Srivathsa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Across most of its range the Leopard Cat is recorded more frequently than sympatric cats (e.g. Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Yasuda <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Gumal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014), especially in disturbed areas such as logging concessions (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), however, in some surveys leopard cats are recorded less frequently than other species (e.g. Pusparini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Loken <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), particularly in areas of primary forest (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Leopard Cats have also been detected in oil palm plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Rajaratnam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Yue <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press), however, fewer individual Leopard Cats were detected, and the detection rate was lower, in a survey of a large oil palm plantation, located at a greater distance from natural or semi-natural vegetation, compared to a smaller plantation, located close to natural vegetation, (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), suggesting that proximity to surrounding forest remains an important factor.<br/><br/>With a wide distribution and tolerance to human modified landscapes the Leopard Cat’s population is abundant. However, it is not invulnerable to habitat loss and degradation and this, coupled with hunting, is likely causing population declines in some regions (e.g. Seto <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Wilcox <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014a, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). In the late 1980s on average 200,000 Leopard Cat skins were exported from China (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although the actual harvest was likely much higher, possibly up to 400,000 (Yu 2010). Although the Leopard Cat is more tolerant to habitat disturbance than sympatric felids it likely experiences higher mortality rates in these areas (e.g. Rajaratnam 2000). Haines <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2004) report survival rates of 92% in a protected area compared with only 53-82% in areas with higher human activity. <br/><br/>Island populations are particularly at risk of extinction, with the Iriomote Cat <em>P.b. iriomotensis</em> listed as Critically Endangered, and the Visayan Leopard Cat <em>P.b. rabori</em> of the Philippine islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu and possibly Masbate listed as Vulnerable. The small population (approximately 100) on Japan's 710 km<sup>2</sup> Tsushima Island, considered the same subspecies as that which occurs in northeast mainland Asia, has decreased over the last 30-40 years (Izawa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). The population of the Western Ghats, India is geographically isolated due to a climate barrier and should be managed as a discrete conservation unit (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).",Stable,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread species. It is found through parts of India, west into Pakistan and Afghanistan (Habibi 2003), through the Himalayan foothills, throughout most of China, and north to the Korean peninsula and into the Russian Far East (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its range extends south throughout Southeast Asia, and includes the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Taiwan. The Leopard Cat is found on numerous small offshore islands of mainland Asia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It is the only wild felid in Japan, where it occurs on the small islands of Tsushima and Iriomote, and the Philippines, where it occurs on the islands of Palawan, Panay, Negros and Cebu, there are unconfirmed reports from Masbate but it is presumed to be extinct on Guimaras.<br/><br/>There are many recent records from protected and non-protected areas throughout its range examples include Borneo: Danum Valley Conservation Area and surrounding production forest, Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Crocker Range National Park, Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kabili-Sepilok and Gomantong Forest Reserves, and Tawau Hills National Park (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), Maliau Basin Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2011), Deramakot Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2009), Sabangau National Park (Cheyne and Macdonald 2011), Wehea Forest (Loken <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data), Upper Baram region of Sarawak (Mathai <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010), Sumatra: Gunung Leuser National Park (Pusparini <em><em><em><em>et al.&#160;</em></em></em></em>2014), Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), Singapore: Pulau Tekong (Chua 2013), Peninsular Malaysia: Endau Rompin National Park (Gumal <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Cambodia: Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Myanmar: Taninthary Nature Reserve and Hlawga Park (Than <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Thailand: Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Simcharoen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014) Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Lao PDR: Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014a), Nepal: Chitwan National Park (Lamichhane <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Makalu-Barun National Park (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010), India: Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary (Punjabi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014), Rajaji National Park (Saxena and Rajvanshi 2014), Bhutan: Royal Manas National Park (Tempa <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), China: Wanglang National Nature Reserve (Yu 2010), Russia: Zov Tigra National Park (Kerley and Borisenko 2013).<br/><br/>The range map of the current assessment is based on known localities, coupled with habitat (Hansen 2013), molecular and climatic data (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).","Leopard Cat skins are commercially traded internationally for the fur trade, primarily coats. Skins are also used as decorations in some parts of its range. Leopard Cats are occasionally kept as pets, sometimes taken from the wild and sometimes from captive breeding and they have been interbred with domestic cats, particularly in the West, to make the popular Bengal breed. Their bones are used in some traditional Asian medicines (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Leopard Cat populations in Bangladesh, India and Thailand are listed on CITES Appendix I, and all other populations are listed on Appendix II.",Terrestrial,"The Leopard Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II, and populations in Bangladesh, India and Thailand are included on Appendix I (as <em>Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis</em>).

50664030,22732,Panthera uncia,Vulnerable,C1,2017,2016-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Snow Leopard is assessed as Vulnerable because the global population is estimated to number more than 2,500 but fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, and there is an estimated and projected decline of at least 10% over 22.62 years (3 generations). There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book <em>Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson<em> et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the <em>Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex <em></em>(<em>Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (<em>Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (<em>Capra</em> <em>falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (<em>Marmota </em>spp.), pika (<em>Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (<em>Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (<em>Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of <em>ca</em> 25 years (Lovari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali <em>Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi <em>et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The number of mature individuals in the population is estimated to be less than 250, with a continuing decline estimated at over 25% over the next three generations (generation length estimated at 10 years). In addition, over 95% of individuals are presumed to be in one subpopulation (Mount Iglit-Baco National Park), which is less than 5,000 hectares in area.","<span lang=""FR"">Formerly, Tamaraw were found across the whole of Mindoro from sea level to the&#160;high peaks (to over 1,800 m), inhabiting open grassland or forest glades, thick&#160;<span lang=""FR"">bamboo-jungle, marshy river valleys, and low to mid-elevation forests (Rabor&#160;1977). Currently the species is confined to a few remote areas over 200 m, and is most often recorded in secondary forest and mixed forest/grassland (Kuehn 1986, Custodio<em> et al.</em> 1996, Heaney <em>et al. </em>2002).<br/><br/>Tamaraw are largely solitary, although females occur with offspring (Talbot and&#160;Talbot 1966). Males and females occasionally associate temporarily throughout the year (Custodio <em>et al. </em>1996), which is similar to other bovine species, such as African Buffalo, Banteng and Gaur. The solitary nature of the species is probably an adaptation to forest habitats, where large groups would prove to be a hindrance (Eisenberg 1966, in Kuehn 1986).<br/><br/>Tamaraw feed primarily on grasses, as well as young bamboo shoots, in open grasslands, resting within tall grasses or dense forest (Talbot and Talbot 1966). Although formerly diurnal, Tamaraw have become largely nocturnal due to human encroachment and disturbance (Talbot&#160;and Talbot 1966). Within its ""core zone"" inside Mount Iglit-Baco National Park, the Tamaraw again </span><span lang=""FR""><span lang=""FR""><span lang=""FR""><span lang=""FR"">shows </span>a rather diurnal behaviour and can be seen in larger groups, which can be explained by the relative protection they benefit from there.</span>","In the 20th century, the main threat to the Tamaraw was habitat loss due to farming by resettled and local people, with high human population growth rates in and around its remaining habitat. In some areas, fires set for agriculture are a threat to the species' habitat. Cattle ranching and farming activities pose a number of threats, including the risk of diseases spreading to the Tamaraw from livestock and burning of pastures leading to a reduced number of palatable grass species. Historically, Tamaraw were hunted for both subsistence and sport, which led to a period of drastic decline in numbers of individuals and populations (Rabor 1977). Hunting was carefully regulated prior to World War II, but since then a growing human population, logging operations, ranching, and widespread availability of firearms on Mindoro have caused a dramatic decline in numbers (Talbot and Talbot 1966). Since the 1980s, sport hunting has reduced due to a decline in the Tamaraw population, closure of nearby ranches, and more intensive patrolling and awareness activities since the establishment of the protected area. International trade in this species or its derivatives has not been reported. Although protected by law, the illegal capture and killing of this species continues.<br/><br/>Nowadays the main threat to the species stands in the lack of options for the remaining tamaraw populations to disperse and increase their range due to human pressure and shortage of undisturbed natural corridors (Schütz 2015). Poaching and illegal activities from lowlander Mindorenos pose a serious problem for wildlife. Besides this, traditional hunting activities from local indigenous communities in Tamaraw areas are a serious source of disturbance and possible cause of injury to tamaraw even if the species is not targeted (pit fall trap, snare trap). Moreover, land-use pressure from local indigenous communities is generally increasing in Mindoro due to population growth and incapability of those people to expand in lowland areas that are now occupied by new settlers.","In 2016, three separate subpopulations are known to survive on Mindoro. Population estimates undertaken have increased in frequency and have benefited from improved techniques and equipment over time. Based on most recent surveys and animal counts the minimum total population is estimated at around 430 individuals with 50 to 70% of these mature individuals (Boyles 2016). The subpopulation of Mount Iglit-Baco National Park, as of April 2016 was estimated to number approximately 413 individuals according to the last Tamaraw population count operation. The estimated number of individuals has increased subsequently since the start of the counting operation in 2000, but it is highly probable that the observed increase is both a reflection of improved estimates as well as immigration from animals coming from outside the counting area, rather than population growth (Schütz 2015). Nowadays this subpopulation is confined to the so called ""core zone of the monitoring"" at the south-west edge of the protected area, where the annual counting takes place and where regular ranger patrols ensure relative protection against poaching and disturbance. Even so, the area of occupancy of the species within the zone has been drastically decreasing since two decades from 5,000 hectares to only 2,000 hectares (Schütz 2015).<br/><br/>The subpopulation on Mount Calavite (the most northerly site) in 2004 had an estimated 15 individuals based on faecal matter and animal tracks; there has been only one confirmed sighting. The current population is assumed to be much lower with no sightings in several years (pers. comm. 2014). The subpopulation of Aruyan-Malati had an estimated population of 15 to 20 individuals in the 2000s (TCP results of the 2007 field survey has assessed around 16 animals). According to recent surveys and interviews of local communities, a maximum of 12 animals might still survive within a restricted area of less than 1,000 hectares (Schütz 2015). Also local communities living in remote areas of the centre of the island report the presence of the species in at least three other sites, in Mount Halcon range, the upper Amnay river (Eagle Pass area) and the east side of Mount Wood, but this information must be confirmed.<br/><br/>An estimated continuing decline of 25% over the next three generations (approximately 30 years) does not seem unreasonable given that the number of subpopulations reportedly declined from five or six to three between 1990 and now, with the population of Mt Calavite and Aruyan-Malati which can be considered in a critical situation.",Decreasing,"<span lang=""EN-US"">The Tamaraw is endemic to the Philippine island of Mindoro (9,735 km² in area),&#160;where it was formerly widespread across the island (S. Hedges and W. Duckworth pers. comms. 2000, Heaney <em>et al.</em> 2002). However, the current range is estimated to cover less than 10,000 hectares (Schütz 2015) and limited to the mountainous interior of the Island: Mount Iglit-Baco National Park (the largest protected area of Mindoro located in the centre of the Island), the Aruyan-Malati&#160;Tamaraw Reservation (Municipality of Sablayan), and Mount Calavite Wildlife Sanctuary in the north of the Island represent the three known surviving subpopulations and are all located on the Occidental part of Mindoro (Custodio <em>et al.</em> 1996, de Leon <em>et al.</em> 1996). Few other isolated groups are suspected to exist outside these subpopulations (Schütz 2015). The species was more widespread prehistorically in the Philippines, with Pleistocene epoch records from Luzon (Beyer 1957 in Kuehn 1986).",<p>Tamaraw are used for local consumption and in the past for sport hunting.</p>,Terrestrial,"The Tamaraw is listed on CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I. Tamaraw receive total protection under Philippine law. The largest of the three known subpopulations occurs in Mount Iglit-Baco National Park. A small number of Tamaraw are held in captivity in the Philippines, but the captive breeding program has had no success. Of the 21 individuals captured around 1982, there were nine individuals remaining in 1997. As of 2015 only one animal, born in captivity, was still alive and held in a half hectare enclosure. To date there are no further plans for captive breeding and the subject remains controversial. The original captive breeding programme consisted of placing the animals in a semi-natural ""gene pool"" on Mindoro, but these animals were not intensively managed, nor were the husbandry techniques focused on building a large captive population.<br/><br/>Few initiatives have been undertaken recently to address the critical situation of the species: the proclamation of the Aruyan-Malati area as “Critical Habitat” is underway and shall lead to better protection under a legal framework. Moreover, a general Protected Area Management Plan for Mount Iglit-Baco National Park shall be implemented in the near future and lead to the creation of a proper zoning system and consistent habitat management approach with the residing indigenous communities. A strictly protected zone has been already outlined within the core zone of the monitoring with no hunting activity measures.<br/><br/>Required research for this species includes to continue the island wide population survey to update the actual range of the species and determine if there are any additional extant populations. There is also a need for improved habitat conservation through effective management, which passes through better integration of the indigenous mangyan communities living within the range of the Tamaraw into habitat management plans. This must start by furthering ethno-ecological studies to better understand these communities, their claim, subsistence needs, their pattern of land-use (including the slash and burn agriculture) and vision upon the environment. Priority shall be first given to the remaining existing populations by securing and expending their range.

During fieldwork for the Philippine Cockatoo, the species was regularly encountered on the island, but population estimates are not available. No recent information from Ramos is available, but it is likely that Bugsuk is now the stronghold for the species.<br/><br/>In the late 1990s, a small stock of eight mouse deer escaped from their enclosures on Calauit Island, where the species had been maintained and bred since 1982.

61978138,41780,Tragulus javanicus,Data Deficient,,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Tragulus javanicus</em> is listed as Data Deficient partly reflecting the lack of clarity over how many species of chevrotain occur on Java and therefore how much of the available information about the genus refers to <em>T. javanicus</em>. However, even taking an assumption that there is only <em>T. javanicus</em> on the island, information applicable to red listing is limited. Given the considerable uncertainties that exist for all members of the genus (see Red List accounts for other species), largely as a result of general oversight of chevrotains in faunal investigations, the comparison of some historical accounts of <em>T. javanicus</em> with recent fieldwork results is difficult to interpret, not least the species tolerance of hunting is poorly known, as is it's likely response to habitat disturbance. Additionally the presumed short generation length of the species, considered to be likely under five years, also influences assessment, in that, for decline criteria to be invoked in Red Listing one would have to assume relatively high rates of decline in a relatively short window of time, <em>ca </em>10-15 years, since the present. There are fair indications of a decline, perhaps a major one, and a category such as Vulnerable is quite likely to be applicable.  Dedicated field investigations (throughout Java) of status are urgently warranted, and the species Red List status should be reviewed regularly in light of current uncertainty and concerns.","Hoogerwerf (1970) wrote of chevrotains on Java occurring ""from sea-level to high in the mountains"". In the Dieng plateau area, V. Nijman (pers. comm. 2008) found them only a few times in the lowlands (400–700 m asl), where most survey took place, and had no records from above about 1,500 m asl. They have been found on Gunung Gede–Pangangro up to about 1,600 m asl (V. Nijman pers. comm. 2008). Hoogerwerf’s (1970) description of favoured habitats on Java suggests that chevrotains there might be an 'edge' species, certainly seeming to prefer areas with thick understorey vegetation, such as that along riverbanks. This would not be unusual within the genus (see other <em>Tragulus</em> accounts).","Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting longstanding high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""game reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. During the 1980s to the mid 1990s, guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. However, the strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some small game, through various forms of trapping, including snaring; this latter could well have included chevrotains. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other offtake, but the national parks of Java remained remarkably intact for much of this period. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the peoples' resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (S. Hedges and M. Tyson pers. comms. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ‘tragedy of the commons’, has indeed led to increased destruction and poaching in the past decade. There is some evidence that species readily uses edge and secondary vegetation, meaning that effects of forest encroachment will be less serious than for old-growth forest obligates. Moreover, chevrotains already seemed rare for surveyors operating in the early–mid 1990s, when habitats had been relatively stable since 1970s or early 1980s. For any decline which may have occurred in the 1980s and early–mid 1990s, therefore, habitat factors are an unlikely driver.<br/><br/>Chevrotains occur regularly in markets in towns such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Malang, but often they are cramped in small cages, and can therefore be overlooked, and may even be more common than observations suggest; numbers in trade are surprisingly high given the small numbers to be seen in the field nowadays (V. Nijman pers. comm. 2008). They have been traded at high levels for many decades: Hoogerwerf (1970) wrote of “numerous reports of mouse deer being regularly trapped and offered for sale alive” in Java. They are hunted and traded both for pets and as wild meat (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Numbers passing through markets in Jakarta, Bogor, and Sukabumi have recently declined sharply, perhaps because of tightened control by the forest police in those markets; but there is the possibility that falling trade might indicate, at least in part, increasing difficulty to catch the animal and thus a decline in populations. In the Malang area, it is still “relatively easy” to procure one, although it is “getting time consuming” (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is probably largely with snares; dogs are also likely to be a serious threat (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). They are vulnerable to active hunting at night through a propensity to freeze when spotlit. However, the effects of these comparably high hunting levels on the genus in Java have not been studied empirically.<br/><br/>The continued presence of many animals in markets suggests that significant populations remain somewhere on Java (assuming that the animals are not now imports from elsewhere in Indonesia), and thus that a major decline may not have occurred, despite current indications. A comparable situation was found with Inornate Squirrel <em>Callosciurus inornatus</em> in Lao PDR, when extensive 1990s surveys found few animals in the field, in contrast with historic statements of abundance and ongoing substantial numbers being traded in fresh meat markets. This led to conservation concern for the species (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999); but later field survey of degraded and edge areas found out that the species was indeed common and evidently a species associated with degraded areas, and had hence been severely under-recorded by the 1990s surveys (Timmins and Duckworth 2008).","There appears to have been no field study specifically of chevrotains on Java but current wildlife surveyors agree that they are rarely seen compared with results from similar styles of observation in Kalimantan (S. van Balen, V. Nijman, E. Meijaard, M. Tyson and S. Hedges, all pers. comm. 2008). Even Hoogerwerf (1970), who clearly found the species with some regularity (explicitly not daily, but enough for him to learn its calls and thereby establish dates of a probable mating season), complained that “it is particularly difficult to obtain any insight into the situation of this species in Java”, but concluded that “it is improbable that the species is in danger of extinction”. The basis for an unattributed statement in Whitten <em>et al</em>. (1996), that “it is still numerous and can be seen easily in many areas such as the tourist park part of Pangarandaran Nature Reserve” is unclear. The genus was recorded at five of ten sites on the Dieng Plateau surveyed in 1999–2000, but mostly only through single observations (V. Nijman pers. comm. 2008). S. van Balen (pers. comm. 2008) points out that in Java the genus seems very shy (compared with animals in Malaysia and Kalimantan), so most records come as footprints. This contrasts with the assignment by Hoogerwerf (1970) that the genus was common and widespread. It is therefore quite plausible that a major decline has taken place, although other explanations remain to be explored which could have bolstered Hoogerwerf’s sighting rates, such as his having a dog with him which flushed the chevrotains, or his spending a lot of time in the species' favoured microhabitats. Specifically, neither M. Tyson nor S. Hedges (pers. comm. 2008) saw chevrotains during a rhinoceros survey in Ujung Kulon in 1992, whereas this was Hoogerwerf’s (1970) main site in assessing the species as relatively common and readily found. It was camera-trapped there five times during 1991–1993 (van Schaik and Griffiths 1996), a rate comparable with that of many other species in the study and certainly not suggesting out-and-out rarity. Very recently, numbers in trade in Java have dropped sharply in most cities, and it is plausible that this reflects increasing difficulty in procuring the animal (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008).",Unknown,"<em>Tragulus javanicus</em> as here defined is endemic to the island of Java, Indonesia, according to Meijaard and Groves (2004). The latter authors did not mention the island of Bali, but a sighting was reported from Bali Barat National Park, Bali, in a bird watching trip report (Birdquest 2006). The genus was not listed for Bali in the exhaustive reviews of Chasen (1940; of the genus) or Meijaard (2003; mammals of Indonesian islands), nor by Grubb (2005). Given the live-animal trade in the genus on Java, further records are needed to confirm whether or not there is a native population of the genus on Bali. If there is, biogeographic considerations suggest it would be most closely related to the Javan population and quite probably conspecific.<br/><br/>Hoogerwerf (1970) wrote that ""in Java <em>T. javanicus</em> was encountered in all provinces, fairly intensively distributed from sea-level to high in the mountains"". Present-day occurrence in East Java is questionable: S. Hedges, M. Tyson and E. Meijaard (pers. comm. 2008) know of no certain records (as distinct from listings in collation documents which do not cite information to primary source) from areas like Baluran or Alas Purwo national parks, despite high survey effort during 1991–2000.<br/><br/>Meijaard and Groves (2004) gave only one specific locality for the species: Cheribon (= Cirebon) on the north coast of West Java Province, which is the type locality of <em>T. j. pelandoc</em> Dobroruka, 1967. Dobroruka (1967) also mentioned the western part of Java, to the southern coast, for what he called <em>T. j. focalinus</em> (which is <em>T. javanicus s .s.</em>). Meijaard and Groves (2004) did not list the localities for the many specimens they examined. Dobroruka (1967) and Van Dort (1986) both discuss variation within Javan chevrotains; neither has yet been checked for specific localities. More recent localities, although not of specimen records, include: Gunung Halimun (reportedly camera-trapped some time before 2003 (Suyanto 2003), but the photograph is not reproduced in the appendix and a painting is used for the species instead); Ujung Kulon (1991–1993; van Schaik and Griffiths 1996, C.P. Groves pers. comm. 2008), and the Dieng Plateau (during 1999–2000; V. Nijman pers. comm. 2008). There has been no collation of records from the various surveys over the last 20 years or so, and some observers no doubt are aware of other localities.",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Chevrotains on Java occur in some protected areas, e.g. Ujung Kulon (Hoogerwerf 1970; van Schaik and Griffiths 1996) and were earlier said to “occur in all game sanctuaries in Java and in most of the nature reserves established on that island...."" (Hoogerwerf 1970). The species has been officially protected since 1931, yet it is still hunted.<br/><br/>The taxonomic revision of Meijaard and Groves (2004) means that <em>T. javanicus</em> is endemic to Java, and, if it occurs, Bali. There are fair indications of a decline, perhaps a major one, and thus this newly-revealed endemic species should be swiftly removed from the anonymity in which it has lain for decades. An urgent first step is a collation of existing information, because it is possible that many more records exist than were traced during the preparation of this assessment. This should include trawling likely observers and examination of collections not covered by Meijaard and Groves (2004). If insufficient number of specimens are found to clarify the number of taxa on Java, more should be obtained. Some may come from markets but, because of the pre-eminence of locality in determining systematics among very similar taxa, specimens of known locality origin must form the basis of analysis. Whatever the number of species on Java, the difference in sighting rate between Hoogerwerf (1970) and observers from the 1990s onwards is suggestive of a major decline, although other explanations are possible (see Population and Threats). Current status needs to be clarified through specific surveys for the genus (camera-trapping, but undertaken in a way more suitable for smaller species than is usual, spotlighting, and hunting surveys may all play a role). Surveys must take care to investigate secondary and edge areas which are often eschewed by general wildlife surveys in favour of the less encroached areas.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
61978315,41781,Tragulus napu,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Greater Oriental Chevrotain is listed as Least Concern because chevrotains remain widespread and at least locally common in the Sundaic region and, at least on Borneo, it appears that this species is resilient to hunting although probably not to habitat degradation. Better data would allow a more confident assessment. Its wide altitudinal tolerance (presumed to be up to 1,000 m asl) means that it has large populations outside the altitude of very rapid forest loss so cannot be listing on population decline rate inferred through Sundaic forest trends. The presumed short generation length of the species, considered to be likely under five years, also influences assessment, in that, for decline criteria to be invoked in Red Listing one would have to assume relatively high rates of decline over a large part of the species range in a relatively short window of time (10–15 years). Thus although there may be/have been drastic (local) reductions, these have probably not been synchronous over a large enough area.<br/><br/>There remains the uncertainty over the species relative abundance at various altitudes, in part due to a rather low proportion of modern records of <em>Tragulus</em> from the species range having been identified conclusively to species, however, on the balance of current evidence, this uncertainty  is not adjudged sufficient for listing as Data Deficient (if currently assumed altitudinal distribution was shown to be erroneous this might affect Red Listing).","The Greater Oriental Chevrotain is almost completely sympatric with <em>T. kanchil</em>, but the degree of syntopy is less clear. In the lowlands of Borneo both occur but <em>T. napu</em> apparently ranges to higher altitudes (up to at least 1,000 m asl) than does the latter (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). Relevant comparisons have not been traced for the other main occupied landmasses. Duckworth (1995) considered that the chevrotains demonstrably common at Similajau National Park were largely or entirely Greater, but on altitude use as given in Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) it would seem surprising if Lesser did not occur. However, Matsubayashi and Sukor (2005) found at Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, that <em>T. kanchil</em> was almost absent from mature forest, all animals in such habitats being <em>T. napu</em>. Almost all observations from Similajau were from climax forest. Much more information of chevrotain habitat use in areas of sympatry is desirable before firm species-level conclusions can be drawn. <em>T. napu</em> was found typically to range 19 ha in old logged forest and 7 ha in primary forest, this difference again suggesting an association with primary forest (Heydon 1994). Heydon and Bulloh (1997) suggested the obligate frugivory of chevrotains limited their ability to compensate for logging-led loss of fruit trees by browsing the abundant regrowth of logging areas. The abundance of <em>Tragulus</em> spp. (<em>T. napu</em> and <em>T. kanchil</em> combined, with no information on the proportions or even confirmation that both species were present) was higher (strongly statistically significantly so) in areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra than in the interior of the park, suggesting higher numbers in somewhat encroached habitat. Also at this site, <em>Tragulus</em> was more than nine times as abundant in areas of the park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting limited resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003); note that it is not confirmed that this information refers, even in part, to <em>T. napu</em>. The genus (presumably including this species) was ubiquitous in a study of virgin jungle reserves (VJRs) of West Malaysia which paired each of seven VJRs with a nearby unprotected area with seriously encroached habitat (Laidlaw 2000). The ability of <em>T. napu</em> to use plantations is probably low, because all (the admittedly relatively few) sources agree that it does not persist well in secondary or logged forest. Moreover, Belden Giman (pers. comm. 2008), in extensive observations at Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu, Sarawak, has never recorded <em>T. napu</em> in any of the blocks of monoculture plantations there, despite many records of <em>T. kanchil</em>. Given the pace of conversion of forests to plantations across the range of <em>T. napu</em>, clarification of its degree of plantation use is urgent.<br/><br/>Competition with <em>T. kanchil</em> is not pronounced. In Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, <em>T. napu</em> was largely confined to mature forest with <em>T. kanchil</em> only in immature forest (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). In unlogged forest at Danum Valley, Sabah, <em>T. napu</em> was significantly more common than <em>T. kanchil</em>, but following logging, the numerical dominance of <em>T. napu</em> declined, and in 2–5-year-old regrowth <em>T. kanchil</em> was the commoner species. By 12 years post-logging, <em>T. napu</em> had reasserted its numerical predominance (Heydon 1994).<br/><br/><em>Tragulus</em> spp. are generally thought to be nocturnal, and at two sites in Borneo, they comprised over half the contacts of spot-lighting surveys (Duckworth 1997), but Matsubayashi and Sukor (2005) found substantial amount of both day- and night-time activity in this species. Duckworth (1997: 186–187) pointed out that most chevrotains spotlit in Similajau National Park, Sarawak, (identified as <em>T. napu</em>) were sitting around resting. The related <em>T. kanchil</em> was considered highly solitary by Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2006) and this may also be somewhat true for <em>T. napu</em>; Duckworth (1995: 177) observed chevrotains identified as <em>T. napu</em> 14 times, of which 12 records involved singles and two involved duos in apparent association.<br/><br/>Collation of information from general sources suggests the following, but the contribution of information from <em>T. nigricans</em> to these conclusions is unknown, so their reliability for <em>T. napu s.s.</em> should be considered preliminary. Females gestate for 152–155 days and give birth to one or, rarely, two young. Young wean at 2–3 months, and reach sexual maturity at 4.5 months. Animals live up to 14 years. The female can be pregnant throughout her adult life, often having just an 85–155 minute 'breather' between giving birth and becoming pregnant again. The young are born fully developed, and can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Mothers nurse their young standing on three legs. They are generally solitary.","Hunting and habitat loss occur at high levels almost throughout Greater Chevrotain’s range, but the species is said to be relatively resilient. However, few data to support this assessment have been traced, particularly because most key studies have not within the Sundaic region identified chevrotains to species. Thus, while clear that the genus remains widespread and common in the face of these threats, there seems to be little publicly available evidence that <em>T. napu</em> specifically does so, and reasonable evidence that it is not very adaptable to forest degradation (see Habitat and ecology). However, on the assumption that most chevrotains above 100 m asl on Borneo are this species rather than <em>T. kanchil</em>, Borneo at least retains large populations. Greater Oriental Chevrotain is extinct on Singapore (K. Lim pers. comm. 2008), although the relative contributions of hunting versus habitat perturbation are not known.<br/><br/>Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjacs and lowest for chevrotains, as assessed by diameter of the cable (Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003). Chevrotains were scarcer in areas of higher human use (and thus hunting) of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003; see Habitat and ecology). Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) profiled the effects of hunting in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas, upon chevrotains (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995. They constituted 8–9% of animals killed. No direct or index measure of chevrotain densities was possible at these sites to determine what effects, if any, such heavy hunting was having on chevrotains. Chevrotains are among the most favoured wild meat by inhabitants of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu, Sarawak, after Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> and wild pigs <em>Sus</em> (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008).","Greater Oriental Chevrotain populations are not well studied, in part reflecting a general lack of research interest in the genus and in part its almost complete sympatry with the Lesser Oriental Chevrotain, from which separation requires care under field conditions (Duckworth 1997, Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). It seems to be relatively common on at least Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). In Thailand, at the northern margin of its range, it is generally rare (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008); for example, during the flooding of the Chiew Larn Reservoir (Surat Thani province; about 9°00′N, 98°45′E; 20–130 m asl), only six Greater Chevrotains were ‘rescued’ compared with 172 Lesser Chevrotains (Nakasathien 1989). The genus is commonly camera-trapped and recorded by signs on Sumatra and in West Malaysia (Laidlaw 2000, O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Azlan 2006) and in far southern Myanmar (Lynam 2003; the identifications to species should be disregarded). At the Danum Valley, Sabah (East Malaysia), densities were recorded as 32–72 animals per km² in primary habitat; they were more scarce in selectively logged areas, with densities of 6–16 animals per km², indicating a marked decrease in <em>T. napu</em> in selectively logged forest vs unlogged (Heydon and Bulloh 1997, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). Because population densities of Southern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus muntjak</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> rose in the logged areas in this same study, the decline in chevrotains presumably reflects habitat factors rather than the secondary complication of logging-induced hunting. Population densities for <em>Tragulus</em> spp. (presumably including this species) in Taman Negara, Malaysia, were taken to be 0.37–0.83 per km² (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004). Duckworth (1995) considered that the chevrotains demonstrably common at Similajau National Park in 1986 and 1995 were largely or entirely Greater (see Habitat and Ecology).",Decreasing,"<em>Tragulus napu</em>, as constituted here (that is, excluding <em>T. versicolor</em> of Indochina and <em>T. nigricans</em> of the Philippines) occurs in the Sundaic subregion, extending some way up the Thai–Malay peninsula, in the following countries: Brunei, Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, and many small islands), Malaysia (West Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak, and many small islands), Myanmar (far south only), Singapore (Pulau Ubin only), and Thailand (south only) (Meijaard and Groves 2004, Chua <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Grubb (2005) also included Cambodia, Lao PDR, and ‘Indochina’ in the range of <em>T. napu</em>; but this was founded on the assumption that because <em>T. versicolor</em>, formerly considered a subspecies of <em>T. napu</em>, occurred in Viet Nam, <em>T. napu</em> must presumably occur in intervening Lao PDR and Cambodia. There is, for example, a map of such a conterminous range for <em>T. napu</em> in Corbet and Hill (1992). There is no evidence of such a distribution and, given the distribution patterns of other species, absolutely no reason to expect that it would have such a range, even if <em>T. napu</em> and <em>T. versicolor</em> are closely allied. Recent surveys in both countries have not suspected the species (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The northern limit on the Thai–Malay peninsula is not well clarified. Despite fairly intensive camera-trapping in Kuiburi National Park, Thailand (12°N and thus within the generally-assumed range for <em>T. napu</em>), Greater Chevrotain has not been photographed there. It must be scarce in this park if it occurs at all (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Caution is needed in interpreting modern records of <em>T. napu</em> from anywhere outside the specimen- and photograph-validated range (as presented in Meijaard and Groves 2004); some camera-trap studies seem to have taken an essentially arbitrary attitude on naming their photographs of chevrotains, resulting in published listings of <em>T. napu</em> from, for example, northern Thailand. Because such listings never highlight the significance of such records, let alone discuss them, all are assumed to be in error, and are not discussed further, here.",For information on&#160;Use&#160;see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Hunting and habitat loss occur at high levels almost throughout this species’s range. Adequate legal basis exists in all range states to control both threats (through protected areas and regulations governing wildlife trade and hunting). The chief need is for effective translation of these laws into action. There are no obvious species-specific needs additional to general consolidation of protected areas and enforcement of hunting and wildlife trading laws.<br/><br/>The paucity of Sundaic studies determining chevrotains to species shows admirable caution but hinders assessments of this species’s status. Better data would be useful to confirm the opinion-based conclusion here that this is a resilient species, and to investigate further habitat use, in areas where it overlaps with <em>T. kanchil</em> and in those (probably, primarily at higher altitude) where it does not.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The presumed short generation length of the species, considered to be likely under five years, also influences assessment, in that, for decline criteria to be invoked in Red Listing one would have to assume relatively high rates of decline over a large part of the species range in a relatively short window of time (10-15 years). Thus although there may be/have been drastic (local) reductions, these have probably not been synchronous over a large enough area.<br/><br/>There are several major uncertainties, although these are not adjudged sufficient for listing as Data Deficient: (1) a rather low proportion of modern records of <em>Tragulus</em> from both the Sundaic and non-Sundaic portions of the range have been identified conclusively to species; (2) the conflicting nature of the information available concerning the effects of hunting (harvest levels are locally very high) and habitat destruction; (3) strong indications that in its non-Sundaic range it is localized in occurrence, a pattern for which the reasons remain opaque, but which has been proposed to result from hunting; (4) the apparent restriction to the extreme level lowlands in at least Borneo, placing it within the altitudinal zone of rapid forest loss.","This species is found in lowland/foothill primary and secondary forests as well as cultivated areas up to 600 m in elevation (Semiadi and Boeadi pers. comm.).  The habitat of this species is a mosaic of riverine, seasonal swamp and dry undulating country, vegetated predominantly by legumes and dipterocarps.  In Sabah, it also inhabits mangrove forest.  In Peninsular Malaysia, it feeds on shoots, young leaves and fallen fruits in the tall forest of the lowlands.<br/><br/>During the day it may prefer crown-gap areas with dense undergrowth of creeping bamboo, and move to higher and drier ridge areas at night. All <em>Tragulus</em> species are associated with forests, but there is strong evidence that <em>T. kanchil</em> does not require old-growth forest or even particularly mature secondary forest. Its heavy use of disturbed habitats was confirmed by Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. (2003), who found that in Kabali-Sepilok (Sabah), <em>T. kanchil</em> fed primarily in crown-gap areas dominated by bamboo stands, probably because it prefers fruits and soft leaves of pioneer plants with lower concentrations of secondary metabolites. Later, at another site in Sabah, Matsubayashi and Sukor (2005) again found a strong association of <em>T. kanchil</em> with immature forest.  Johns (1997) found <em>Tragulus</em> to be more common in logged forests than in mature forests in Peninsular Malaysia, and densities tended to decrease again as logged forests matured. The abundance of <em>Tragulus</em> spp. (<em>T. napu</em> and <em>T. kanchil</em> combined, with no information on the proportions or even confirmation that both species were present) was higher (strongly statistically significantly so) in areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, than in the interior of the park, suggesting higher numbers in somewhat encroached habitat (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003); note that it is not confirmed that this information refers to <em>T. kanchil</em>. The genus (presumably including this species) was ubiquitous in a study in West Malaysia which paired each of seven of virgin jungle reserves with a nearby unprotected area with seriously encroached habitat (Laidlaw 2000). By contrast, at the Danum Valley, Sabah (East Malaysia), densities of <em>T. kanchil</em> were 21–39 animals per km² in primary forest but only 10–15 animals per km² in selectively logged areas (and there was an even bigger decrease of 55–66% for <em>T. napu</em>); in this area, where hunting is negligible and so is not confounding patterns, chevrotain densities were positively correlated with fruit abundance, and negatively correlated with pioneer trees and grass and herbs (Heydon 1994; Heydon and Bulloh 1997; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). Heydon and Bulloh (1997) suggested the obligate frugivory of chevrotains limited their ability to compensate for logging-led loss of fruit trees by browsing the abundant regrowth of logging areas. This may be significant in rationalising the differences between areas concerning the apparent effects of logging on the species: in some logging areas, fruiting trees are common along streams and tend to be left, and pioneer colonists produce abundant edible fruit. Around Buon Luoi, southern Viet Nam, most encounters with chevrotains (assumed to be largely or entirely this species rather than <em>T. versicolor</em>, based on ratios of specimens) were in places where tall forest alternated with scrub thickets, patches of grassland and moist riverine habitats. Riverbank slopes appeared particularly favourable to chevrotains (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) sees Lesser Chevrotains commonly in highly degraded forest in Mondulkiri province, Cambodia. In Thailand, R. Steinmetz (pers. comm. 2008) finds the species commonly in edge habitats, also widely, but probably less frequently, within big blocks of closed-canopy forest. By contrast in Lao PDR, the genus seems to be scarce in the interior of old-growth forest, based on surveys of many of the country’s remaining forests. Chevrotains have been camera-trapped in at least one protected area (Nakai–Nam Theun NPA), but only in one part of that (Johnson and Johnston 2007); the report does not discuss habitat. Tracks are readily identified by those familiar with them, but are rarely found within heavy forest in Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Chevrotains are easily spot-lit at night where they occur, yet extensive spotlighting in south and central Lao PDR during 1992–1996, with most of such survey in areas below 550 m asl, found the species only once, and there were not many more records by day (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994; Duckworth 1996, 1998; Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000; and a lack of records in many other sources). All or nearly all the handful of sightings (day or night) were in edge or heavily degraded areas (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), but some lengthy surveys of lowland encroached forest failed to find the genus (notably in the ‘corridor’ sector of Phou Xang He NPA). This indicates a general overall rarity, or at least a localised distribution, either natural or human-induced. The apparently large numbers on the Vientiane plain (see Threats; Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992) (at the time of surveys perhaps among the most intensively hunted areas of Lao PDR for mammals of this size-class), including persistence at dreadful sites like Houay Nhang (whence almost all mammals larger than rats had been hunted out; see Threats), argues against human agency being responsible for the absence or low densities of chevrotains elsewhere in lowland Lao PDR in places like the corridor of Phou Xang He NPA and interior forests. Extensive surveys in the 1990s of Lao forest areas suggests almost certainly that in extensive tracts of semi-evergreen and evergreen forest below 1,000 m asl chevrotains are naturally scarce at least away from ‘edge areas’, because hunting pressure from snares, dogs, and day and night hunting with guns is relatively low, and other quarry species captured in similar ways to chevrotains are often common (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In contrast, Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004), who concurred that, in Viet Nam, closed-canopy forests often support few if any chevrotains, proposed that this is an artificial pattern produced through hunting (see Threats). In Lao forest ‘edge’ areas the very low numbers of chevrotains cannot necessarily be concluded to be a natural pattern, as these ‘edge areas’ tend to be in the vicinity of human settlements and in at least the 1990s experienced high levels of snaring and gun hunting (primarily by day) for primarily local consumption or local markets and ubiquitous hunting dog presence (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Experiences in 2005, however, suggest that chevrotain presence is perhaps highly patchy and correlated to specific habitat features, as in the Nam Kading National Protected Area there was a clear hunting focus on chevrotains with an evidently significant capture rate; yet general wildlife field surveys in 2005 and 1995 observed the species in the field only once, despite significant spotlighting effort (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000; Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2005; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It suggests that the species is tied to specific microhabitats; perhaps this might be related to water requirements as there is a surprising regularity with which authors note commonness in riverine areas. Dumas’s (1944) description of the distribution in Cambodia strongly echoes modern findings that it is localised in Lao PDR and associated with gaps in Sabah: he stated that it was absent from heavy forest of tall trees without understory, and in general it was localised in occurrence but found somewhere in each of most of the forested provinces of Cambodia, wherever there are low, dense, thickets, and within clumps of bamboo, of which it is fond of the young shoots. Such a pattern 70 years ago seems unlikely to have been produced by hunting. In sum, the habitat use of this species with respect to edge–interior areas shows startling heterogeneity, at least in non-Sundaic areas, but this cannot yet be explained; in particular, disentangling the contributions of intrinsic habitat suitability and the effects of hunting is difficult.<br/><br/>The Lesser Oreiental Chevrotain may even be able to survive in large numbers in plantation landscapes: in the Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu, Sarawak, Belden Giman (pers. comm. 2008) has many records from <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations both mature and immature. However, this landscape contains many patches of secondary and old-growth forest (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007), so further study is needed to assess use, if any, of landscape-level monocultures.<br/><br/>Most of this chevrotain’s geographic range is dominated by evergreen or semi-evergreen forests, but large areas of Cambodia, Thailand and to a lesser extent Lao PDR and Viet Nam are deciduous. One survey in Mondulkiri province, Cambodia, in 2008, found chevrotains to be widespread and common in mixed deciduous forest, dominated by e.g. Lagerstroemia spp., but they were not found in nearby deciduous dipterocarp forest (C. Starr pers. comm. 2008). In this same general area, J. Walston (pers. comm. 2008) also found them commonly in mixed deciduous forest, during 2002–2006. Field surveys of extensive landscapes of deciduous dipterocarp forest and mixed deciduous forest (in which ground fires are almost annual) in eastern and northeastern Cambodia (including Mondulkiri) have not detected the species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and camera-trapping from the same landscapes also suggest chevrotains are absent from deciduous regularly burnt forest tracts, but occur in semi-evergreen forest patches within the same landscapes (WWF unpublished data). Dumas (1944) stated that chevrotains were unknown in the deciduous dipterocarp forests of Cambodia, No other information on their use of deciduous landscapes has been traced; it is probable that even within deciduous dipterocarp forest they might use the semi-evergreen riverine strips within.<br/><br/>The Lesser Oriental Chevrotain may be absent from highlands throughout much of its range, and seems to be an extreme lowland specialist in some areas. The clearest analysis, from Borneo, found that it lived mostly below 100 m asl, with no record above 600 m asl (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). The maximum altitude in Indonesia (i.e. Borneo and Sumatra) is also said to be 600 m asl (G. Semiadi and Boeadi pers. comm. 2006); specific information from Sumatra has not been traced. In Lao PDR most known sites (see Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994, Duckworth 1996, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000) are also below 600 m asl; however, chevrotains are abundantly hunted in the Nam Ha NPA which has a minimum altitude of 560 m asl (and rises to nearly 2,100 m asl) and is almost entirely rugged (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003), although these are perhaps more likely to be <em>T. williamsoni</em> than <em>T. kanchil</em>. There is a chevrotain specimen from Thateng on the Bolaven plateau (FMNH 38012) confirmed as <em>T. kanchil</em> (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008), suggesting occurrence at 800–1,200 m asl, although a short-distance trade origin may be possible. A recent finding of the genus being common in one part of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA (Johnson and Johnston 2007) gives no information on altitude of the records, and there are too few relevant specimens to allow a firm prediction as to which species they relate. Good populations certainly occur well above 600 m asl in Thailand: chevrotains are common in the degraded and edge habitats around Khao Yai National Park headquarters at 760–800 m asl (J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008) and a number of specimens from nearby Pakchong suggest that these are likely to be <em>T. kanchil</em>, rather than unsuspected southerly occurrence of <em>T. williamsoni</em>. Also in Thailand, at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary chevrotains were camera-trapped commonly at 700–900 m asl, although the species involved is/are unclear (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001; A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Lesser Chevrotains visit saltlicks regularly (Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Lesser Chevrotain is often stated to be nocturnal, but in fact most activity is diurnal (in the first few and last few hours of daylight), with animals spending most of the night resting (Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2003; Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). It is highly solitary (Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2006). Apparent territorial behaviour has been observed (Davison 1980); home ranges and core areas overlap considerably between males and females but core areas are completely separate between individuals of the same sex (Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2006). Males are highly philopatric but females establish new home ranges when giving birth (Ahmad 1994 in Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005). Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated home-range size for females at 4.3 ha and for males 5.9 ha using the minimum convex polygon method, but the difference between males and females was not significant. The mean daily distance travelled for males was 519 ± 89 m, that for females 574 ± 220 m. The Lesser Chevrotain is partly frugivorous, but also eats substantial quantities of shoots and young leaves, mostly of fast-growing gap species rather than closed forest understory species; the latter tend to be richer in secondary protective compounds (Dang Huy Huynh 1968; Medway 1983; Kuznetzov and Puzachenko 1992; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2003). Among fruits, those of mass 1–5 g and seeds of mass 0.01–0.5 g are particularly taken (Heydon and Bulloh 1997). It seems to be facultively monogamous–polygymous (given the congruence between core areas of individual males and females with a conspecific of the opposite sex; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2006), with post-partum oestrus, females being almost continuously pregnant (Cadigan 1972 in Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005). The gestation period is 140–177 days (Lekagul and McNeely 1977), with 2–3 young per year, the fawns kept hidden (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005).","Hunting and habitat loss occur at high levels almost throughout this species' range. While it is clear that the genus remains widespread and common in its Sundaic range in the face of these threats, few data to support assessment specifically of Lesser Chevrotain’s current status were traced: many key studies there have not identified chevrotains to species. In the non-Sundaic areas, evaluation of resilience is hampered by evident heterogeneity of chevrotain occurrence with a lack of convergence of opinion as to explanations of some.<br/><br/>North of the sympatry with <em>T. napu</em>, <em>T kanchil</em> is heavily hunted and is often considered one of the most preferred wild meats (Srikosmatara <em>et al</em>. 1992, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, it is clear that <em>T. kanchil</em> is adept at surviving in areas (at least in the lowland plains) in the face of very heavy hunting, major habitat degradation and isolation from other forest areas. Exemplifying this, it was one of the few mammals larger than a rat confirmed to persist at Houay Nhang, an isolate of a few km² of highly degraded forest just outside the capital of Vientiane facing, in the early 1990s, exceedingly concentrated hunting with guns and snares (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994). A little to the west it persists in Sangthong district, which was heavily logged just before a 1996 survey and also supported heavy hunting (Duckworth 1996). These two areas are within 10 and 70 km, respectively, of, and ecologically contiguous with, Thangon, from where Osgood (1932) reported specimens of <em>T. kanchil</em> (confirmed by E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008 as this species), and thus the modern records probably do relate to <em>T. kanchil</em>. Hansel (2004) provided a further record from the adjacent low hills. Numbers of chevrotains in Vientiane markets in the early 1990s (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992) were so high that they could not be at the brink of extinction in this degraded and fragmented landscape. Chevrotains are still common in trade in the city, although mostly in transit rather than on open sale in the city’s markets, and their origin is not clear (T. Hansel pers. comm. 2008). The genus was recently camera-trapped quite commonly in a part of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA where ground mammals were much depleted (Johnson and Johnston 2007), perhaps indicating higher resilience than many other mammals, although there is no information to compare with pre-exploitation levels. <br/><br/>While non-Sundaic chevrotains can, therefore, clearly persist under extreme pressures in at least some circumstances, this does not rule out that densities might be quickly reduced through the twin pressures of hunting and habitat degradation. Decreasing population densities between the 1970s and 1990s, in at least parts of southern Viet Nam, were suggested by both spot-lighting surveys and qualitative assessments of footprints. Near Buon Luoi in December 1978, chevrotains were spotlit at about three animals per 5 km of transect route, but by 1993, when forest had undergone heavy degradation and hunting was very heavy, chevrotains were not even found every night with at least 10 km of transect (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) proposed that night-time hunting may explain chevrotain’s near-absence from habitats with open-understory (this feature allowing chevrotains to be readily hunted using spotlights and guns) in the Buon Luoi area, because by contrast in Cat Tien National Park, where the use of firearms has been banned for decades and enforcement is fairly effective, chevrotains are encountered with comparable frequency both in thickets and on exposed forest floor (Borissenko and Ivanova 2003). This sighting rates contrast is consistent with a difference between the headquarters area of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (where chevrotains are readily found by spotlight) and which is relatively well-protected from hunting, and Lao forests (see above) where hunting was effectively unrestrained (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). However, a proposal that, where hunting is unrestrained, as it is in most of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, chevrotains would be common in heavy forest but have been effectively eradicated from such habitat, is flawed for at least Lao PDR, where numbers of forest mammals killed through spotlight hunting are probably insignificant compared with those trapped (including with snares) and perhaps even killed using dogs (J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on numbers of active hunters encountered at nigh versus traps found, in many areas of Lao PDR). Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) based their reasoning on only two sites and it is possible that other factors explain the differences. In sum, the effects of hunting and habitat modification, and the interaction between them, on non-Sundaic chevrotains remain most unclear.<br/><br/>The effects of potential threats operating in the Sundaic range are not understood well, either. Lesser Oriental Chevrotain is now rather rare on Singapore (K. Lim pers. comm. 2008), presumably nowadays constrained by habitat quality rather than by ongoing hunting, although the role of free-ranging dogs, if any, in restraining population numbers is unclear. However, the ‘island within an island’ situation of remaining forest on Singapore and the extreme habitat loss over the last 150 years prevent useful extrapolation of this species' situation there to other Sundaic areas. Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjacs and lowest for chevrotains, as assessed by diameter of the cable (Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003). Chevrotains were more than nine times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003); note that it is not confirmed that this information refers to <em>T. kanchil</em>. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) profiled the effects of hunting in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas, upon chevrotains (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995. They constituted 8–9% of animals killed. No direct or index measure of chevrotain densities was possible at these sites to determine what effects, if any, such heavy hunting was having on chevrotains. Chevrotains are among the most favoured wild meat by inhabitants of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu, Sarawak, after Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> and wild pigs <em>Sus</em> (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Logging can apparently drive substantial reductions in density, at least locally, although other studies have found it allows an increase in numbers (see Habitat and ecology). No information on the use of plantation landscapes has been traced. In the Greater Sundas, lowland forest is being converted at unprecedented high rates. At least in Borneo, where this species is concentrated in areas below 100 m asl, most of its habitat either has been substantially modified during the last two decades or will be in the next two (e.g. Holmes 2000, BirdLife International 2001, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Fuller <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003, Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, inferring proportionately large population losses in Lesser Chevrotain populations is not possible: depending on how serious hunting is and what exactly is being done to the habitat post-logging (forest regeneration, tree plantation or non-woody habitat) in any given area, chevrotain numbers might remain broadly unaffected, decrease or increase in logged-over areas.","The Lesser Oriental Chevrotain populations are not well studied, in part reflecting a general lack of research interest in the genus and in part the difficulties of confirming how much of the information on the genus relates to this species. <em>T. kanchil</em> seems to be relatively common on at least Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985), specifically in the Bintulu Planted Forests Area in Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). In Thailand, even though it is generally more common than Greater, there are no studies and sightings are too few to determine national population status or trends (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008). During the flooding of the Chiew Larn Reservoir (Surat Thani province; 20–130 m asl), 172 Lesser Chevrotains were ‘rescued’ compared with only six Greater Chevrotains (Nakasathien 1989). At Kuiburi National Park (12°N), only <em>T. kanchil</em> has been camera-trapped (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). The genus is commonly camera-trapped on Sumatra (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003), where this species is reportedly still common (G. Semiadi and Boeadi pers. comm. 2006). The genus also remains common in West Malaysia (Laidlaw 2000, Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Azlan 2006) and in far southern Myanmar (Lynam 2003; the identifications to species should be disregarded). At the Danum Valley, Sabah (East Malaysia), densities of <em>T. kanchil</em> were 21–39 animals per km² in primary forest but only 10–15 animals per km² in selectively logged areas (see Habitat and ecology) (Heydon 1994, Heydon and Bulloh 1997, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). This species specifically was also found commonly in several other sites in Sabah (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2007). Population densities for <em>Tragulus</em> spp. (presumably including this species) in Taman Negara, Malaysia, were taken to be 0.37–0.83 per km² (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004).<br/><br/>Non-Sundaic populations are poorly documented. Chevrotains are common in Thailand’s Khao Yai National Park, at least in the degraded and edge habitats around the park headquarters (J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008) and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001; identifications to species should be disregarded). The genus seems to be of localised occurrence in Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Duckworth 1996, 1998; Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003; Johnson and Johnston 2007; see Habitat and Ecology). Chevrotains seem also to be localized in Viet Nam. They are common in Cat Tien National Park, southern Viet Nam (Borissenko and Ivanova 2003, Polet and Ling 2004). Somewhat further north, intensive sign and spotlighting searches at several sites in lowland Dak Lak in 1997 failed to find the genus (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997; an earlier listing in a report for that area should not be taken seriously, see Duckworth and Hedges 1998: 66–68), although these were mostly in rather or entirely deciduous areas and perhaps outside the species' habitats; however, landscape in parts of the areas surveyed is similar to that in eastern Mondulkiri, Cambodia (see below). Further north again, they were common around the Buon Luoi area, although seem to have declined recently (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). As in Lao PDR, there are many other areas within the genus’s range (as defined by Dang Huy Hyunh 1994) from which reasonably intensive mammal surveys have failed to find the species (e.g. Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park [Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999] and the Huong Son District of Ha Tinh Province [Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001]). In Cambodia, chevrotains were recorded commonly by recent surveys in at least one area of Mondulkiri province dominated by semi-evergreen forest (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2008; E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008; J.L. Walston pers. comm. 2008; C. Starr pers. comm. 2008); but in the primarily deciduous lowlands presence appears to be patchy (see Habitat and Ecology), but no good modern composite picture for the country is available (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Dumas (1944) considered that it occurred in most of the forested provinces of Cambodia, wherever its favoured microhabitats were found.",Unknown,"The Lesser Oriental Chevrotain as defined here occurs in Borneo, Sumatra, the Thai–Malay Peninsula, many islands within the Greater Sunda region, and continental Southeast Asia north to at least 18°10′N, as established through Lao PDR specimens from Thangon (Osgood 1932, Chasen 1940, Meijaard 2003, Meijaard and Groves 2004, E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2004). This includes the countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.<br/><br/>Grubb (2005) also included China, but the occurrence there of <em>T. kanchil</em> is not confirmed, reflecting the difficulty of separation from <em>T. williamsoni</em><em style=""font-style: italic;"">. </em>Records from Yunnan Province seem on present evidence likely at least to include <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. williamsoni</em><em> </em>(E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008) but the additional occurrence of <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. kanchil</em><em> </em>cannot be ruled out. Similarly, records in Viet Nam north to <em>ca</em> 22ºN (Dang Huy Hyunh 1994) and in the west part of Lao PDR’s northern highlands (e.g. Johnson <em>et al. </em>2003; 21°N), could refer to <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. kanchil</em> or to <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. williamsoni</em>, or to a mix. It is unclear if there are chevrotains at all in the central and eastern parts of Lao PDR’s northern highlands. The record of chevrotain signs in Evans <em>et al.</em> (2000) for Phou Dendin NPA, far north-eastern Lao PDR and outside the interview derived range as shown in Duckworth <em>et al. </em>(1999: 269), was by a relatively inexperienced observer and upon recent re-examination of his original notes, he has retracted the record, since confusion with muntjac fawn was possible (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). More telling, during interviews by the same observer in the same area in 2004–2005, villagers commonly reported that while they knew what a chevrotain (""kai"", or ""fan kai"") is, most said they are essentially absent from the area (including the southern sector), and always have been. But whether they are truly absent or only rare differed somewhat with informants (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). Likewise, the northern extent of <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. kanchil</em><em> </em>in Thailand remains unclear. No species of chevrotain appears to penetrate Myanmar away from Tennaserim (Tun Yin 1967, Lynam 2003; in the latter, identifications to species should be disregarded). Well outside the confirmed range of the genus, Khan (1985) speculated that Lesser Oriental Chevrotain might occur in Bangladesh: ""over a hundred villagers, whom I have interviewed have said they have either seen, killed or eaten such an animal"". But he could procure no physical evidence for this, and none has been traced subsequently (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>A recent taxonomic revision of chevrotains (Meijaard and Groves 2004), followed here, attaches a slight doubt to assume that any records, other than those validated through examination of specimens, from non-Sundaic Southeast Asia, certainly refer to this species; as well as<em> </em><em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. williamsoni</em> (of at least northern Thailand, but perhaps with a much wider range) there is also <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. versicolor</em><em> </em>of southeast Viet Nam, also perhaps with a much wider range. This Red List account assumes that the chevrotains of the Mekong basin and Thailand south from 18°N to the Thai–Malay peninsula refer to <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. kanchil</em><em>,</em> on the basis of a fair number of specimens from many localities (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008: a listing of the mainland specimens examined for Meijaard and Groves 2004). Further south, <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. kanchil</em> is widely sympatric with <em style=""font-style: italic;"">T. napu</em>, making chevrotains often challenging to identify (particularly for people with limited field experience of the genus) on field views, camera-trap photographs and even in hunting studies (Duckworth 1997, Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). Many observers have therefore pooled their Sundaic chevrotain records as ‘<em>chevrotain spp.</em>’ (e.g. Bennett <em>et al. </em>2000, Laidlaw 2000, Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2003, O'Brien 2003, Kawanishi and  Sunquist 2004, Azlan 2006, Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006, Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2007). Thus, the information base for determining this species' status is much thinner than would be expected from the general perception of the genus as being widespread and common, at least in the Sundaic part of its range.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Hunting and habitat loss occur at high levels almost throughout this species' range but there is no clear evidence that they are depressing populations, except where formerly suitable habitat is converted to non-forest uses. Adequate legal basis exists in most or all range states to control both potential threats (through protected areas and regulations governing wildlife trade and hunting). The chief need is presumably for effective translation of these laws into action. More specific needs cannot be identified in the absence of more detailed information on this species' current status throughout its range, and investigations of the effects upon it of the high levels of hunting and habitat modification.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
70612310,136366,Sapajus cay,Least Concern,,2018,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern as the species is widespread and there are currently no major threats resulting in a significant overall population decline that would warrant listing it in a threatened category or listing it as NT (Near Threatened). Although population declines were observed over a period of 48 years (three generations), the species is more of a habitat generalist than other species with similar life-histories. However, it is declining in some parts of its range.","The genus is not restricted to primary habitats, but well recognized for its behavioral plasticity (Fragaszy <em>et al.</em> 1990, 2004) and the ability to survive in areas altered by man (Wallace 2008). However, Sapajus may still require relatively large areas of forest for their survival, as in the case of a group of tufted capuchin monitored by Spironelo (1988, 1991) in central Amazonia, which occupied a home range of 1,000 ha.<br/><em>Sapajus cay</em> inhabits subtropical, humid, semi-deciduous, gallery forests and forested regions of the Pantanal, ranging into the Yungas, the dry deciduous forests of northern Bolivian Chaco and eastern Paraguay (not recorded in the Paraguayan Chaco, Stallings 1985, 1989, Wallace 2008). It inhabits Cerrado habitat and riparian and gallery forests in the valleys and hills of the Serra de Maracajú and the Serra de Bodoquena in Mato Grosso do Sul (Pinto 2006, Vieira 2006, Cazzadore 2007, Wallace 2008; Fernandes Júnior 2013).<br/>Yellow-bearded capuchins are extractive and manipulative foragers. They are frugivores-insectivores, including a wide variety of fruits, seeds, arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals in their diet (Milano and Moteiro Filho 2009), supplemented by stems and flower buds. Males and females disperse, and both sexes are organized in linear dominance hierarchies, the top ranking male being dominant over the top ranking female. Subordinate males and females are often peripheral (Vieira 2006, Pinto 2006, Cazzadore 2007, Fernandes Jr. 2013).<br/><em>Sapajus cay</em> is an adaptable species that also occurs in degraded habitats, for example, one group survived for many decades in a urban area, in Segredo Stream State Park (189 ha) in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (Pinto 2006, Kazzadore 2007, Rímoli <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/>Movement Patterns: <em>Sapajus cay</em> is a predominantly arboreal, quadrupedal monkey that generally uses home ranges of 150-250 ha and travels &gt;1,000 m per day (Vieira 2006, Fernandes Jr. 2013)&#160;Congregatory: Social groups (Vieira 2006, Pinto 2006, Cazzadore 2007, Rímoli <em>et al.</em> 2009, Fernandes Jr. 2013)","In Paraguay, there are no major threats. It is hunted for subsistence purposes in some parts of its range, but human population density is typically low in these areas. Hunting (by indigenous people) and forest loss are the main threats in eastern Paraguay (Stallings 1985). As in other parts of its range, Sapajus cay is the most commonly kept primate pet in Paraguay.<br/>However, in Brazil, there are severe threats to the survival of the species. The main threats identified for the taxon are: fire, rural settlements, agriculture, livestock keeping, urban sprawl, vulnerability to epidemics, deforestation, increasing road and energy infrastructure, habitat isolation, habitat reduction, pollution, hunting and life capture for pet trade (Rímoli <em>et al.</em> 2015). For example, in Segredo Stream State Park (PEMS) in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, evidence for an inbreeding depression was observed, i.e. polydactyl individuals with six fingers on hands and feet occurred in some small fragments and habitat isolates (Pinto 2006; Cazzadore 2007).","In Brazil, <em>S. cay</em> is distributed in a region that has recently been affected by road and energy infrastructure improvements, urban sprawl, rural settlements, agriculture, livestock farming and deforestation. It is estimated that these threats have caused severe habitat loss and population fragmentation (see Habitat and Ecology for further comments). Based on information obtained from reporting forms on the genus <em>Sapajus</em> in the Amazon, that can be used for habitat areas of more than 1,000 ha (Spironelo 1988, 1991), it is suspected that the population has experienced at least a 30% decrease over the last three generations or 48 years.<br/><br/>The overall extent of occurrence is estimated at 123,615.35 km². However, the remaining total population size is not known and it remains unclear whether the number of mature individuals is greater than 10,000 individuals (Rímoli<em> et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Stallings (1985) recorded a mean group size of seven individuals (N=4 groups) in the Ybicui National Park. However, larger groups averaging 22 (Vieira 2006) or 25 individuals (Fernandes Jr. 2013) were also recorded.<br/>Population density in the Ybicui National Park was estimated as 4 groups/km² or 28 individuals/km² (Stallings 1985). At other sites population densities were estimated as 0.31 individuals/ha in the upper Rio Paraná region, MS (Aguiar<em> et al.</em> 2011), 0.15 individuals/ha in Terenos, MS (Vieira 2006), and 0.19 individuals/ha in Campo Grande, MS (Pinto 2006, Cazzadore 2007).",Decreasing,"In Brazil, <em>Sapajus cay</em> occurs in the state of Mato Grosso, in south (Cabrera 1957; Wallace 2008), east, west and south-west of Mato Grosso do Sul (Pinto 2006; Vieira 2006; Cazzadore 2007; Rímoli <em>et al.</em> 2009; Fernandes Jr. 2013) and in Goiás State (Melo F.R. unpubl. data), where it is resident and native. It can also reach the regions of Cassilândia (MS) and Itajá (GO) (Melo F.R. unpubl. data) and the Comodoro region (MT) which represents the most western part of its distribution (Messias M. pers. comm.). The northern limit of the species’ range is the southern part of the Xingu Indigenous Park (Garapu Desk, Sete de Setembro River and Lake Ipavu) in Mato Grosso (Silva Jr. 2001). The eastern boundary seems to be the Araguaia River, while the southeastern limit is the Paraná River (Silva Jr. 2001) where it occurs on the islands and floodplains of the Paraná River in an Environmental Protection Area (Aguiar <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>This species is not endemic to Brazil, also occurring in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay (Cabrera 1957; Wallace 2008). It occurs throughout Paraguay, to south-east Bolivia, and into northern Argentina, including the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Formosa and Chaco (Mantecon <em>et al.</em> 1984; Brown 1989).<br/><br/>In Paraguay, <em>S. cay</em> occurs to the east of the Paraguay River (Hill 1960; Stallings 1985, 1989). The distribution extends southward to the eastern part of Paraguay (Stallings 1985; Brown and Colillas 1984), reaching into northwestern Argentina. Capuchin monkeys are not found in the Chaco region of the Provinces of Formosa and Chaco in northern Argentina. Thus, the distribution of <em>S. cay</em> forms a horseshoe shape, bordering the xerophytic Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay (Brown and Rumiz 1986). In the west, the limits are defined by the Andes in Argentina and Bolivia, and in the east it is confined to eastern Paraguay, east of the Paraguay River. Probably its southernmost limit in the east is defined by the confluence of the Paraguay and Paraná Rivers (app. 27º15’ S).<br/><br/>More information to determine the exact occurrence of the species in the basins of the Araguaia and Paraná Rivers (Silva Jr. 2001) and the Mato Grosso do Sul State in Pantanal (Tomas <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011) is needed.",,Terrestrial,"This species occurs in the following protected areas:<br/><br/>Argentina<br/>El Rey National Park Province of Salta (44,162 ha) (Brown<em> et al. </em>1986; Brown 1989)<br/>Calilegua National Park, Province of Jujuy (76,000 ha) (Brown<em> et al</em>. 1986; Brown 1989)<br/>Baritú National Park Province of Jujuy (72,000 ha) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1986; Brown 1989)<br/>BoliviaKaa-Iya National Park (R.

The estimated home range size for some studied groups varies from 80-187 ha (Medeiros<em> et al. </em>2011, Valença-Montenegro 2011) and the minimum viable population size is 70 individuals (Valença-Montenegro 2011).<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Adult male: HB 36.8 cm; TL 37.8 cm; weight 3.0 kg (N=1) (Oliveira and Langguth 2006);<br/>Adult male: HB 40.0 cm; TL 41 cm; weight 2.9 kg (N=1) (Pontes<em> et al.</em> 2006);<br/>Adult male: HB 35.8 ± 3,48 cm; TL 47.8 ± 2.16&#160; cm; <br/>Adult male weight: 2.69 ± 0. 71 kg (N=8) (Valença-Montenegro<em> et al.</em> 2009); 2.75 ± 0. 373 kg (N=9) (Valença-Montenegro 2011);<br/><br/>Adult female: HB 35.1 cm; TL 38.4 cm; weight 1.8 kg (N=1) (Oliveira and Langguth 2006);<br/>Adult female: HB 36.1 cm; TL 38.0 cm; weight 2.5 kg (N=1) (Oliveira and Langguth 2006);<br/>Adult female: HB 36.5 ± 3.28 cm; TL 39.39 ± 3.14 cm; <br/>Adult female weight: 2.03 ± 0.21 kg (N=9) (Valença-Montenegro<em> et al.</em> 2009); 2.12 ± 0. 32 kg (N=10) (Valença-Montenegro 2011).","The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation (mainly through coastal development and sugar cane plantation), isolation of subpopulations and hunting (for food and illegal pet trade).","The remaining population size of this species is an estimated 1,000 individuals (Valença-Montenegro 2011), extremely fragmented into 29 subpopulations. Adult-juvenile ratios in <em>Sapajus</em> populations are usually in parity (Freese and Oppenheimer 1981), thus the estimated mature population size is about 500 individuals. The species apparently forms big groups: in Pernambuco, Araújo <em>et al.</em> (2009) observed a group of 35 individuals and Bezerra <em>et al.</em> (2014) a group of 52 animals. In Paraíba, Valença-Montenegro (2011) recorded groups of nine, 30, 60 and 90 individuals, and Bastos <em>et al.</em> (2015) observed a group of 77 individuals. The extent of occurrence of<em> Sapajus flavius</em> (based on Minimum Convex Polygon resulted from individual records) is about 23,000 km². However, the true area of occupancy is not greater than 150 km² (Fialho <em>et al. </em>2014). Population densities range from 11-33 individuals/km²&#160;(Fialho and Gonçalves 2008, Rodrigues<em> et al</em>. 2010, Valença-Montenegro 2011).<br/><br/>It is suspected that a population reduction of 50% or more will happen over the course of 48 years (three generations), including the current (2018-2034) and two subsequent generations (2034-2066). This is based on Global Forest Watch data for regions of northeastern Brazil in which this species occurs. The data suggest that, should forest loss continue at the same rate that has been seen over the last 15 years, between 30-40% of this species’ suitable habitat could be lost by the year 2066. Combined with subsistence hunting and hunting for the pet trade, these threats meet the criteria for Endangered status.",Decreasing,"Blonde Capuchin occurs in the Atlantic Forest of northeast Brazil in the states of Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte (Oliveira and Langguth 2006, Pontes <em>et al</em>. 2006, Fialho <em>et al</em>. 2014). The northern limit of the current distribution is the Mata da Estrela RPPN (Baia Formosa, RN). The southern limit is marked by the Coruripe locality (Coruripe, AL), 35 km from the mouth of the Rio São Francisco. The western limit is marked by the Mata dos Oito Porcos (São Vicente Férrer, PE) (Fialho <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;A subpopulation was found in the Serra do Estreito (Jucurutu locality), a Caatinga forest area (Ferreira<em> et al. </em>2009).

It is listed as Near Threatened due to its ability to adapt to degraded habitats and the rate of population decline is not high to meet the threshold for a threatened category.,"<em>Sapajus libidinosus</em> occurs in a wide range of habitats, such as dry, deciduous forest, mangroves, forest and scrub of the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil, gallery forest and dry forests of the Cerrado (bush savanna) in central Brazil. They are able to exploit a wide range of food resources, including a variety of fruits, seeds, arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals, supplemented by stems, flowers and leaves. This species is capable of using tools whilst foraging (e.g. Fragaszy <em>et al.</em> 2004, Visalberghi <em>et al.</em> 2008), which is an uncommon behaviour among Neotropical primates. It is highly resistant to anthropogenic disturbances and can survive in areas of disturbed habitat. A home range size of 135 ha was observed in Serra da Capivara (Moura 2007).","<em>Sapajus libidinosus</em> lives in the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil. The ongoing habitat loss was estimated at 50% for the Cerrado until 2002 (Machado<em> et al.</em> 2002) and at 50% for the Caatinga until 2009 (IBGE 2012). This species is severely hunted and collected from the wild for the illegal pet trade. The seriousness of the hunting pressure is demonstrated by the high number of individuals seized from illegal trade by the Wild Animal Screening Centers (CETAS-IBAMA, Levacov <em>et al.</em> 2011). Most of these seized individuals cannot return to the wild because of physical and behavioral disorders caused in captivity. Additional threats are hybrids or exotics deliberately released from captivity. Most populations in the Caatinga biome are isolated on hills and mountains, often damaging or feeding on crops of nearby farms, causing conflicts with farmers and often leading to persecution.","Ferreira <em>et al.</em> (2009) observed a group of 53 individuals, but considering the great variation in group size among capuchins, further studies are necessary. In addition, some studies reported population densities as follows: three groups/km² and 6.7 groups/km² in the Parque Estadual Altamiro de Moura Pacheco, Goiânia, GO (Villar<em> et al.</em> 2007), and 7.1 to 11.3 individuals/km² in the Serra da Capivara (Moura 2007).<br/>The population is declining due to ongoing habitat loss. Both Caatinga and Cerrado biomes, the regions in which the species occurs, have almost lost 50% of suitable habitat due to continued deforestation (Machado <em>et al</em>. 2002, IBGE 2012).",Decreasing,"The species occurs in northeastern Brazil, in the eastern part of the state of Maranhão, from the basin of the Mearim and Itapecuru Rivers, through Piaui and Ceará Staes, into Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, and Alagoas States.

It further occurs in parts of western Bahia and northeastern Mato Grosso, being replaced by <em>S. apella</em> to the north in transition to the Amazon rain forest and the dry forests of Mato Grosso (Silva Jr. 2001). Silva Jr. (2001) indicates that the right (east) bank of the Rio Araguaia may be the westernmost limit to its range to the north, with <em>S. apella </em>occurring west of the left bank, and further south, at the headwaters, giving way to <em>S. cay.</em> The southern limit is in the region of the Rio Grande in western Minas Gerais (Triângulo Mineiro) and northwestern São Paulo. <em>Sapajus nigritus</em> occurs to the south of the Rio Grande (Fragaszy <em>et al.</em> 2004; Rylands<em> et al.</em> 2005).",,Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.

Major threat factors are related to loss, fragmentation and disconnection of the habitat, urban expansion, increase in roads and energy matrix, hunting and hybridization. It is suspected that these factors are leading to a population reduction of about 30% within three generations (48 years). For these reasons the taxon was classified as Near Threatened (NT) approaching the A4cde criteria.","<em>Sapajus nigritus </em>inhabits lowland, sub-montane and montane tropical and subtropical forest of the Atlantic coast of Brazil and also in gallery forest. The taxon is tolerant to environmental changes and disturbances, occurring in secondary forests and utilizing pine and eucalyptus plantations and also inhabits fragments close to corn, bananas and cassava fields (Ludwig <em>et al.</em> 2006) and sugar-cane fields (Rímoli 2001, Rímoli<em> et al</em>. 2008).Capuchins are insectivore-frugivores, including a wide range of plant species, a variety of fruits, seeds and arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals in their diet, supplemented by stems, flowers and leaves (Ludwig <em>et al. </em>2005, Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2013).

The number of females exceeds the number of males. Males disperse from their natal groups, but females are usually philopatric; females may also transfer groups especially when groups divide or there is a change of the alpha male (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2013). The top ranking male is dominant to the top-ranking female. However, the ranks of the lower ranking individuals are not always easy to determine (Lynch 2001, Izar 2006).

These vary in severity between regions, and in some areas considerably exceed the threshold for Vulnerable. In the last three generations (taken to be 24–30 years), declines in mainland South-east Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia), Bangladesh, and possibly Borneo and Sumatra have exceeded 50%, probably by a substantial margin. Despite this Sambar remains common in some localized logged, unprotected areas on Borneo, such as the Hose Mountains of Sarawak (where a national park is proposed but not yet enforced), but only where human access is difficult. The overall decline rate in India has been less, given the presence of large populations in a fair number of well-secured protected areas which have probably remained stable, but a decline rate averaging 30% is reasonable in India outside these areas (i.e. in the less effective protected areas and outside the protected areas network), and in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The situation in China is unclear as in some areas, for example Hainan, population recovery may be occurring, whilst major declines in other regions may have taken place prior to the 24–30 year assessment window; the population on Taiwan appears to be relatively stable. Although declines seem to be reversing very locally in a few sites, these numbers are a very small proportion of the whole population. There is no indication that declines will, at the species level, slow until populations are extinguished outside well-secured protected areas, which currently comprise only a small proportion of protected areas holding the species. Current trends of wild meat and antler marketing in South-east Asia and China suggest declines have probably sped up in some areas especially Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Since the 2008 assessment trends in wildlife exploitation and natural habitat conversion in mainland Southeast Asia, have if anything increased, thus although the relative size of the Southeast Asian population subcomponent has probably decreased compared with that in South Asia, the rate of decline has probably increased. The global population trend is still considered to be a decline somewhere between 30 and 50 % over three generations, for the past, present and future.&#160;The fact that Sambar is at least locally common in a number of high profile protected areas, such as Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and Cat Tien National Park, Viet Nam, and is commonly kept captive and proliferates in menageries in the region, was probably a significant factor in the failure to recognize the plight of the species prior to the 2008 reassessment. These same factors no doubt still to some degree cloud the issue.","No large Indian ungulate has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions than has Sambar (Schaller 1967). Within India, Sambar occurs in the thorn and arid forests of Gujarat and Rajasthan, in the moist and dry deciduous forests throughout peninsular India, in the pine and oak forests at the Himalayan foothills, and in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of northeastern India and the Western Ghats (Sankar and Acharya 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Outside India it extends into temperate-latitude and alpine-zone woodlands of Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). This habitat flexibility is permitted by its broad diet: Sambar has been documented to eat 130–180 species of plants in India alone (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh and Sankar 1991, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), with food requirements less specialised than those of other deer (Schaller 1967). Sambar grazes or browses depending upon the forage available at that time (Schaller 1967, Richardson 1972, Martin 1977, Bentley 1978, Dinerstein 1979, Kelton and Skipworth 1987, Ngampongsai 1987, Sankar 1994, Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Across the very wide altitudinal range occupied in Taiwan, the diet varies reflecting major changes in plant communities (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). Sambar was found to live in much higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests of Nagarahole National Park (Karanth and Sunquist 1992) and there are no doubt also patterns of habitat selection across the rest of its range. Although the highest densities of Sambar so far recorded were in the semi-arid forests of Ranthambore (Kumar 2000), across most of its Indian range Sambar seems to thrive best in well-watered, moist deciduous hilly terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The Sambar occurs up to at least 3,825 m on Siouguluan Mountain, the highest peak of the Central Mountains in Taiwan; elsewhere on the island it ranges down to 150 m asl, mostly living at 2,000–3,500 m (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). It occurs up to 3,000 m on Gunung Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Myanmar, recent camera-trap photographs spanned the range of 0–2,150 m asl (Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is largely restricted to hilly terrain in the Terai Arc Landscape (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), although how much this reflects real habitat selection and how much it is an artificial pattern produced by human effects (habitat conversion and hunting) is unclear. More widely in India, there does seem to be a marked preference for undulating terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar usage was greater of the higher than the lower altitude area. However, it makes wide use of plains areas elsewhere, where these have not been destroyed, e.g. the Hukaung Valley in Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008).In Borneo, while Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered Sambar “most common in secondary forests of gently-sloping terrain” they also knew of occurrence in “tall dipterocarp forests on steep terrain and in swamp forests”. In Thung Yai, Thailand, Sambar signs were twice as abundant in lowland forest as in montane forest, although this difference was not statistically significant (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Across seven sites in Thailand, places where sambar was detected had shallower slopes, more open habitat, were closer to streams, closer to roads and villages, and had lower rainfall (Lynam <em>et al. </em>2012).In Southeast Asian regions of dense evergreen closed-canopy forest, Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978, Heydon 1994, Stuebing 1995, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Sabah, Sambar was camera-trapped in both mature and young forest stands (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). All the remaining Lao populations are centred around areas with extensive open, or at least broken, habitat amid forest (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), and the general paucity of records from the interiors of large blocks of closed-canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which generally support the least depleted large mammal populations, probably reflects natural patterns of habitat occupation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Similarly, in extensive tracts of deciduous dipterocarp forest the species occurs primarily around patches of denser habitats, and this seems to be a natural rather than hunting-led pattern (Timmins and Ou 2001). In this sense, in Indochina Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em> is much more tolerant and versatile than is Sambar. In southern and central India where much of the forest is deciduous, Sambar is a true forest ungulate and conspicuously avoids disturbed and open forests, and is highly sensitive to any sort of forest resource extractive activities (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar was primarily in areas of high tree and herb density with low shrub density. O'Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) found no statistically significant difference in Sambar abundance between areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and those deep in the interior of the park. Caution is needed in inferring that there is truly no association of Sumatran Sambar with forest edges (which would be astonishing by comparison with its habitat use elsewhere) because the study does not specify whether this ‘non-significant’ result might simply reflect methodological factors rather than a genuine lack of biological effect (see, e.g., Johnson 1999). Despite the population rises that occur in post-logging forest, there is no evidence that Sambar can survive landscape-level conversion to exotic plantations or other non-forest land-uses, although many live in coconut plantations (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and it is relatively common in immature <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations within the matrix of plantation and natural forest of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;Camera trapping in oil palm plantations adjacent to Danum Valley in Sabah suggest that the species does not utilize plantations (Yue and J. Brodie unpublished data).A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Sambar only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007). In forest protected areas of Thailand such as Khao Yai National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sambar populations are often concentrated around anthropogenic grass and scrub (e.g. sites of former villages) rather than in the forest itself (Trisurat <em>et al</em>. 1996; Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and this also seems to be true on remote parts of the Bolaven Plateau of south Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Annamite mountains of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Sambar seems often to be associated with degraded valley bottom areas, largely the result of long human influence: although the effects of a permanent water source and differences in terrain in determining distribution are difficult to disentangle (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar regularly visits salt licks (e.g. Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007), perhaps especially when growing new antlers. This predictability exposes it to high levels of hunting, where this is not effectively controlled. It seems that within an area, not all sort of licks are visited. At the Seima Biodivesity Conservation Area, Cambodia, Sambar photographs were initially very few at mineral lick camera-traps. But in 2007, cameras placed on trails and at some permanent water sources (especially in semi-evergreen forest) recorded Sambar much more often. Checking tracks at more than 40 licks indicated that some were used by Sambar and Red Muntjac, but not Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> or Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, while the big ones with many cattle and elephant prints had few Sambar prints (E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar was considered to be mostly nocturnal by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004), to show ‘no pattern’ (meaning unclear; perhaps intended to imply no significant variation through the 24-hour cycle, although this is itself a pattern) by O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003), and to be cathemeral by van Schaik and Griffiths (1996). In fact, its activity pattern may vary across sites, but in general it is mostly crepuscular, with significant nocturnal activity as well (Schaller 1967; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is essentially non-social, stable groups being at most family associations (Schaller 1967; Karanth and Sunquist 1992). However, it is often in groups, presumably temporary, of 12–30 in dry deciduous and semi-arid forests of India (e.g. Bandipur, Pench, Melghat and Ranthambore) (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and the same is true around the secondary grasslands within Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). During peak summer, such associations of up to 80–100 near large waterbodies are not uncommon in Pench in central India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A detailed review of information on grouping in Sambar is in Sankar and Acharya (2004). Results from many areas show a strong bias in sex ratio to females, perhaps reflecting selective predation; alternatively, stags may be more vulnerable to stress (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Breeding is rather seasonal in most areas where studied, for example Schaller (1967) reported that in Kanha the rut spreads over a period of at least seven months with a peak in November–December. Stags during the rut sometimes can cover large distances, up to 10–20 km in one night. Further information for India is reviewed in Sankar and Acharya (2004). The bucks of Formosan Sambar have a seasonal antler cycle, and the mating season is from June to January with a peak in September–October. Males wallow and mark with scent glands in this season. Fawns are born (usually singly) from March to August, with a peak in May and June (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Predation appears to be the major cause of Sambar mortality. In Bandipur, Sambar is one of the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (31%), Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> (8%) and Dhole <em>C. alpinus</em> (13%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur Sambar remains were found in about 22.3% of Tiger faeces, 6.1% of Leopard faeces and 7.3% of Dhole faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, proportion of Sambar in Tiger’s diet was about 25–29%, derived from faeces and kill data respectively (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Sambar together with Gaur contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). Sambar occurred in 50% of Tiger scats in Pench-Maharashtra (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Sambar together with Gaur are selectively predated by Tiger.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region and in much of the rest of Sambar’s range. Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow <em>Capricornis crispus</em> and Reeves’s Muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).<br/><br/>There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats <em>Panthera</em>) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs <em>Munitacus</em> spp.<br/><br/>Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (<span lang=""EN-US"">A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002,&#160;J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km<sup>2</sup> per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing,&#160;as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press).&#160;Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.<br/><br/>On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and muntjacs <em>Muntiacus</em>) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001).&#160;Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).<br/><br/><p> </p>  <p>In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of <em>Acacia mangium</em> although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments.&#160;The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p>Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). &#160;If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound.</p><p><br/></p> Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brodie <em>et al. </em>in press b, c). Degradation <em>per se</em> is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2014; Lynam<em> et al.</em> 2012, Brodie<em> et al.</em> in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species. &#160;In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.<br/> <br/> Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa <em>Rusa timorensis</em> has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital <em>Axis axis</em> (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.</span>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Almost everywhere outside Taiwan and <span lang=""EN-GB"">well-managed protected areas<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">in India, the Sambar is in rapid decline, which has lead to very low numbers and many local-level extinctions over a wide area. The occasional healthy populations reflecting special circumstances. Few surveys specifically target Sambar, but a reasonable picture of its current status is emerging through surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris </em>and through general wildlife surveys. Tiger-oriented camera-trapping predictably yields photographs of Sambar when it is present, and most Tiger surveys afford priority to elucidating Sambar status as a key prey, and therefore population determinant, of Tiger. Understanding Sambar status through surveys of Tigers or, sometimes, of Leopard <em>P. pardus </em>(e.g. Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2007) needs care, because such surveys have generally selected the best remaining areas for very large mammals within the country or region in question, so as to maximize chances of picking up Tigers. They therefore cannot be seen as indicative of Sambar status in the wider landscape. Most importantly, in the several cases (identified below) where such surveys have found few Sambar, these indicate cause for alarm, because there is little reason to believe that there ought to be larger populations in many other areas in the country or region in question, even though large parts of it may remain unsurveyed. Occasional herds can survive in unexpected places through atypical site-specific circumstances in some countries (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Populations outside the native range are not treated here, as they are irrelevant to assigning the Red List Category and Criteria.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Sri Lanka, numbers have probably declined substantially through poaching which increased during the civil war. Poaching occurred widely across the country, including within protected areas, particularly where there are concentrations of resettled refugees (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/> <br/> In India, although the Sambar occurs widely and in many habitat types, and large populations occur in well-secured protected areas, nowhere is it now regionally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004); although see below. It has been recorded in 208 protected areas (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India, cited in Sankar and Acharya 2004); its distribution outside protected areas is now generally highly scattered. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Sambar status is best in the three southern Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">.

The situation outside&#160;protected areas&#160;in the three southern states is however often very different and “mostly in the red”, but there are a few exceptions, like the Valparai Plateau in Tamil Nadu where Sambar is very common, and can be found on private lands (Sridhar <em>et al. </em>2008, N.

Similar surveys at Kaziranga found too few Sambar to estimate populations there (Karanth and Nichols 2000), this presumably representing habitat characters rather than defective protection, given the buoyant populations of other deer at that site (Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and forest-resource extraction (Jathanna <em>et al. </em>2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data as of 2008).<span lang=""EN-GB""> Local population trends in well protected reserves appear to be stable and even increasing in areas recently freed from anthropogenic pressures (D.

But in poorly protected reserved forests subject to hunting and heavy cattle grazing, Sambar density seems to be extremely low; certainly too low to permit actual estimation of density (D.

This remains healthy and there are also good populations in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Across the country Sambar has declined so rapidly and so widely that it is now very rare outside protected areas, mostly recorded as isolated reports from forests adjoining these protected areas, and from south-east Nepal. Sambar has been victim of poachers, probably because of its large size (thus, more meat per animal and, for males, a more impressive trophy), perhaps compounded by nocturnal and relatively docile nature; recent declines are of the magnitude to meet IUCN criteria for Vulnerable on a national assessment (all information: Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). It is unclear whether the demand for antler in velvet in eastern Asia is stimulating poaching in Nepal.<br/> <br/> No information concerning current status was traced from Bhutan but (simply on an area basis) numbers are unlikely to be large enough to influence the overall global population trend.<br/> <br/> In Bangladesh, the Sambar was common in the north-east, south-east and hill-tract forests in the 1960s (Khan 1985) but now is restricted to the forest fragments of the southeast, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar occurrence in protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and eco parks) is now doubtful and all recent records and reports have come from outside protected areas from areas that were largely inaccessible to the majority of people prior to 1997 due to insurgency (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar was detected by camera-trapping at 22 of 38 surveyed grid cells (each &gt;50% forest cover&#160; and 10,000 ha) in the CHT during 2010-2011, but it was assumed that outside the survey area, Sambar was either absent or occurred in very low numbers (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Within the best two grid cells (rated in terms of forest cover, inaccessibility and presence of Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>) detection rate of Sambar was 2.07 independent photos/100 camera trap nights. Following the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladesh Government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (the political organization of CHT indigenous people) both the rate of habitat loss and hunting pressure have been accelerating in the period after 1997 (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). There is no sign of significant change in either factor in near future and if current habitat loss and hunting rates continue indefinitely extirpation of sambar is likely within the next 30 years (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""> In China there were major declines in Sambar over much of the twentieth century, and populations probably decreased by more than 50% in the 30 years from 1978 to 2008; records from Guangxi suggest that, there at least, the 1970s–1980s was the era of fastest decline (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008; B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). In some provinces populations seem now to have stabilized, and in some areas, particularly in Hainan (where several apparently stabilised populations are present, but all are small, reflecting habitat patch size: the largest may be of only a few hundred animals) and north Guangdong province (perhaps also the east of that province, where there is a nature reserve specifically for the species), populations may even have been increasing once again in the last few years. This is not so for Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Further north, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei, a multi-method Tiger survey in 2001 found that Sambar is very rare overall and scattered in present-day distribution (Tilson <em>et al.</em> 2004). For elsewhere in China, Smith and Xie Yan (2008) mapped wide presence in Sichuan, plus isolated populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, and Fujian. The original sources are not clear, and R. Harris (pers. comm.) doubts that Sambar has lived anywhere in Qinghai in recent times. <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, numbers and geographic distribution reduced rapidly through hunting before 1987, then expanded somewhat since the mid 1990s reflecting reductions in hunting. The average population density in the Yu-Li Wildlife Refuge was 10.6 animals per km² in 2005. In some areas at high altitude, densities exceed 40 animals per km², and the animals have a large impact on the coniferous saplings in this area. But at low to mid altitude, hunting pressure remains high enough to restrain their distribution and density. Based on the known geographical distribution, there are five populations: A-Yu Mountain, Nanhu, Shei-Pa, Jade Mountains–Central Mountains, and Tawu. The A-Yu population was re-introduced (about 70 animals) by local deer farmers in 1988–1991, when the velvet price was very low through the impact of deer TB in 1985. This population has not expanded reflecting continuous poaching; it may be genetically polluted. The other four populations are all natural, assumed to be isolated by cross-island roads, and may have very low gene flows with each other. Sambar is largely restricted to protected areas, only occurring outside them in a few nearby areas. The population sizes and distributions in these areas are smaller than in the protected areas. The poaching pressure is an important limitation to Sambar in these unprotected areas (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Myanmar, Sambar was detected at 12 of 15 camera-trapped Tiger sites during 1999–2002, indicating that it was still widespread (Lynam 2003). Sambar meat and antlers were commonly found in local markets in the Hukaung Valley in 2002 (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014) indicating heavy hunting pressure, possibly partially explaining extremely low densities of tigers in the area at that time (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; The Myanmar Forest Department and Wildlife Conservation Society have since jointly (as of May 2008) camera-trapped 21 survey areas (including the earlier 15) and found Sambar in 13 (S. Htun pers. comm. 2008). This lower ratio of proven presence indicates how the areas selected for Tiger survey were above average for prey and may indicate increasing local-level extinctions. For example, in a multi-method study of one area not expected to hold Tiger, hunted animals showed that Sambar still occurred in Naungmung and Machanbaw (south of Hkakaborazi National Park, Kachin state), but it was so scarce that it was not detected by substantial amounts of either camera trapping or sign surveys (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005). Even within these best areas, large declines are suspected and overall national population losses of about 50% over the last 25–30 years and in the following such period are likely (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006; Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Thailand, several protected areas maintain big Sambar populations; these are mostly large with very few or no people living within them. Over much of the country Sambar is extinct or very nearly so, including in many protected areas, particularly in the north where most parks are small and heavily poached (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is rare in most areas of Thung Yai Naresuan, where commercial hunting has targeted large ungulates (Steinmetz <em>et al. </em>2008). Sambar was recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations during a Leopard survey in Kaeng Krachan National Park, and clearly remains widespread there. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert et al. 2007). Sambar is also locally abundant in Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam et al. 2006), and the remote core zone of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). In Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary current Sambar density is about 2–3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and it seems to be increasing (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Lao PDR, Sambar was described as very common throughout the wooded parts by Delacour (1940). Some decades later, the species was reported during 86% of 1988–1993 village interviews (n = 328) and was then still widespread throughout, except in the most heavily settled areas (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999: Annex 5). However, sightings on surveys during 1992–1998 were very rare, and while calls heard by night and signs indicate a wide distribution, numbers are heavily depressed (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001). Only in Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA did Sambar seem at least locally abundant (Davidson 1998), and reasonable populations were confirmed still to persist in 2003–2004 (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004); an exceptional area in an Indochinese context, that still supported significant Tiger numbers in 2008 (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010). The Nakai Plateau and the mountainous interior of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and a few other, localized, areas of Lao PDR, including the Dong Kalo tract of Xe Pian NPA, the Nam Hiang area of the Bolaven Plateau, and parts of Nam Kading NPA also seemed to support relatively high densities during the mid 1990s. The few sites resurveyed during 2004–2007 have in general shown major declines (e.g. Timmins and Robichaud 2005). There was not a single camera-trap photograph during fairly intensive camera-trapping in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2007, although the species has subsequently been found to persist in a few parts of the protected area (Johnson and Johnston 2007; W.G. Robichaud and Nam Theun Watershed Management Protection Authority pers. comm. 2008) and it is not clear whether quirks of camera-trap placement (e.g., hypothetically, a focus on slopes rather than valley bottoms) may have been a major contributor to the lack of photographs. The Nakai Plateau still supports noteworthy numbers in a Lao context, but even here there were signs of decline (Dersu 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014) and no Sambar were camera-trapped in Xe Sap NPA during relatively extensive camera-trapping (~40 sites, ~5,000 trap-nights) in 2012 and 2013 (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). Surprisingly, given the proximity to China and Viet Nam, a good population was found to persist in Phou Dendin NPA in the far north-east of Lao PDR in 2004–2005 (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). In sites surveyed since 2008 evidence for persistence has been found in most large forest blocks (e.g. &gt;50,000 ha), although nowhere common, but generally not in small and isolated fragments, while in many areas of the country evidence suggests increasing levels of hunting especially commercial scale snaring (SUFORD 2010, Duckworth in press, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2014, 2009, in press b, Woxvold 2009, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Viet Nam, in most of the northern highlands, in particular, and all other areas of Viet Nam to an increasing extent, Sambar is very rare or has been hunted out from many areas of otherwise suitable habitat (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999; Grieser Johns 2000; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014; B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping studies in Pu Mat National Park, Thua Thien Hue province and Quang Nam province between 1998 and 2007 recorded only a handful of records and local communities in all these areas report a major decline in numbers (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Greater than 19,000 camera-trap nights from &gt;100 locations in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves detected the species from only one location (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). With so many higher-profile species long listed as threatened on the Red List, many of them with restricted ranges, the status of Sambar in Viet Nam has largely been ignored, and the paucity of evidence during many surveys has rarely been highlighted in reviews. As with many large mammals, populations were thought to be best in southern parts of the country, but even here hunting pressure is high in most remaining forest areas, and Sambar is thought to be scarce to extirpated in most remaining forest areas (a high proportion of which is within protected areas) (Timmins in press a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). It was not considered at all common in surveys of several areas of prime habitat in Dak Lak Province in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997). In a three week survey of forest in western Dak Nong Province only a single Sambar was detected on the basis of signs, this despite the area being contiguous with Seima PF in Cambodia (Timmins in press a). It remains locally common in Cat Tien National Park (Polet and Ling 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), but this is very much the exception to the species status in almost all protected areas in Viet Nam (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, Sambar “appears to be at least relatively common in some areas, though entirely absent from others, a feature which appears to have a strong correlation to local hunting pressure. At the current rate of persecution, this species is likely to decline sharply over the next few years (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the 2008 assessment Sambar was considered “still widespread, although heavily targeted by hunters and most populations are now very depressed (Timmins and Men 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, Timmins 2006)”. However substantial declines have certainly occurred since that time (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), as a result of increasing hunting pressure, especially in the east because of Vietnamese driven trade (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Timmins in press a), but elsewhere because of increasing ease of access to forest areas as a result of infrastructure development, settlement of frontier forest areas and agriculture and forestry concession developments (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). <span lang=""EN-GB"">In Seima PF, Phnom Prich WS, and Mondulkiri PF Sambar densities are considered too low to allow density and population estimation, although behaviour is also thought to contribute to the low detection rate on line transects there (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The population is almost certainly smaller even than that of wild oxen, and probably numbers in the low hundreds of animals (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). Sambar densities are low throughout the Eastern Plains (e.g. Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011; Timmins and Ou Ratanak 2001), almost certainly a result of targeted hunting in combination with the ecological association of Sambar with ‘edge’-type habitats and riparian corridors. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the eastern plains of Cambodia, where populations of many other ungulates were and still are magnitudes more numerous than in other areas of Indochina, Sambar numbers are clearly low, almost certainly as a result of targeted hunting: numbers in some areas seem depressed even well below those of wild cattle (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014;&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Gray <em>et al. </em>2013, 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins and Ou 2001). Protection activities in a few localised areas appeared initially to have stabilized declines up to c. 2008, but this was an exception to a general scenario of rapid decline, and now it appears that even in these reasonably well managed areas with significant resources input into protection and law enforcement activities that hunting pressure is rising in intensity, presumably largely because of the increasing lucrative nature of the trade in wildlife, rather than a decrease in protection efforts, augmented somewhat by the greater connectivity and better infrastructure connecting wildlife sources to markets (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, J. Khamler pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). These declines are evidently faster and more recent than in either Lao PDR or Viet Nam, reflecting the rapid pace of change of economic and logistical factors in Cambodia since the mid 1990s. Since the species' assessment in 2008 this rate of decline has almost certainly increased, perhaps even by an order of magnitude (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The primary reason for this increase has been the rapid economic growth that Cambodia has seen in the intervening period, particularly the rapid development of agro-industry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). This by itself would not necessarily lead to major declines in Sambar, but the infrastructural development associated with agricultural concessions has created easy access to huge areas of formerly relatively remote forest areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Even protected areas are not secure, with legal concessions granted within the former boundaries of even those with strong international support (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2014). At the same time illegal exploitation of the rich natural resources of Cambodia has increased, as commodity values have increased, as access to these resources has increased and as regional cross-border natural resource trade networks have become stronger (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Recent studies have confirmed what was earlier suspected that Sambar populations even in some of the areas of best wildlife status are highly depressed, but more worryingly however there are no signs of a significant recovery in such areas and hunting pressure may in fact be increasing despite concerted resource investment in protected area management, particularly law enforcement strategies, from international NGOs (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2011; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; S. Brook pers. comm. 2014; J. Kamler pers. comm. 2014). Although the rates of decline have been increasing in Cambodia, concurrently as the numbers of animals remaining have decreased, the influence of the Cambodian population status on the global population trend has probably changed little (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> For a review of the species status in Peninsula Malaysia Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2014) considered that the rate of decline was sufficient to warrant an Endangered listing, i.e. a 50% or greater decline. This conclusion was based on several lines of evidence, most notably the results of camera-trapping surveys showing absence and or low densities in a majority of remaining forest areas, and rates of forest loss. Camera-trapping studies between 1998 and 2008 over more than 20,000 trap days, detected Sambar (68 photographs) in only 3 of 18 Permanent Reserved Forests, but detected the species in all five protected areas surveyed (346 photographs in c. 19,900 trap-days) (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">), however the species was only commonly detected (e.g. capture rate &gt;1/25 trap nights) in two PAs Taman Negara K Koh and Endau Rompin and one PRF Temenggor. Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) like the majority of the studies that formed part of the synthesis of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>(2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">) was specifically aimed at Tigers and their prey, and hence camera-traps were set specifically with Sambar detection in mind, the results are thus particularly informative of Sambar status; during the study Sambar was photographed at only one of the nine areas surveyed during 1997–1999, Temenggor, where it was the most commonly photographed mammal (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In more recent studies from 2009 to 2013 totalling more than 40,000 trap days focused on three national priority tiger conservation landscapes Sambar was detected by camera-trapping in only four of ten forest units surveyed, with presence confirmed in another through observational surveys of signs, but was only commonly detected in one, Royal Belum State Park (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">). The high incidence of muntjac and pig pictures in both earlier and later periods of survey clearly indicate that the results are indicative of Sambar status rather than an issue with camera-trapping methodology. &#160;In the 1990s, Sambar was found in only one of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas) in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves, making it the most localized mammal species visually detected on forest transects (Laidlaw 2000, K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 2014). The occupied site was a logged area (Laidlaw 2000). None was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006; one of the 23 studies assessed by <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Camera-trapping and sign-based survey studies in Taman Negara NP have independently corroborated declines in Sambar numbers between c. 2000 and 2010 (<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Crude density estimates based of photographic capture-recapture analysis of individually recognizable stags (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) declined from 0.20 to 0.01 animals per km<sup>2</sup> while the occupancy estimate declined from 0.54 to 0.19 in Taman Negara. It is possible that the Sambar density was always low in the primary rainforest but the species is now extirpated in a forest reserve and disturbed unprotected forest adjacent to the Taman Negara sampling area (K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-US"">. <br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">An analysis of potential Sambar range in West Malaysia calculated a c. &gt;25% loss of potentially suitable forest between 1980 and c. 2010 (<span lang=""EN-GB"">DWNP 2010<span lang=""EN-US"">). Serious recent declines are also corroborated by an interview survey of hunters in which over 80% of 61 interviewees from throughout Peninsula Malaysia considered declines had occurred (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Goldthorpe and Neo 2011<span lang=""EN-US"">), and a decline in the number of hunting licences issued for Sambar (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi 2008,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

Sambar appears to remain fairly common in three of the eight sites, the Maliau Basin and Danum Valley in Sabah, where protection from hunting is reasonably good and the Hose Mountains of Sarawak which are relatively inaccessible (Brodie et al. in press a, b, <span lang=""EN-US"">J. Brodie in litt. 2014). Sambar was found to be present but uncommon in the remaining areas of Mulu National Park (Sarawak), Pulong Tau National Park (Sarawak), the Ulu Padas region (Sabah), the Ulu Trusan region (Sarawak), and the Ulu Baram (Sarawak) (Brodie <em>et al.</em> in press, <span lang=""EN-US"">J.

Other populations previously reported to be in reasonable condition include those in <span lang=""EN-US"">Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005), and Deramakot Forest Reserve (Matsubayashi <em>et al.</em> 2007) both in Sabah. Sambar has been extirpated or persists only at extremely low densities in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia (Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006). An intensive survey of Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, found Sambar only once; this was stated to be a genuine reflection of actual rarity, and to result from intensive hunting at salt-licks (Meredith 1995). Across Sarawak and to a lesser extent Sabah it is seriously reduced by hunting (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2000, see Threats; A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008), although persistence is probably still widespread (J. Brodie in litt. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""il""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In the Indonesian part of Borneo populations seem to be less depleted, particularly in East Kalimantan, which is believed to hold the largest Sambar populations among all Kalimantan provinces; in the Penajam Paser Utara district of East Kalimantan, approximately 60 hunted animals are sold monthly in several traditional markets (Semiadi <em>et al.</em> 2004, G.

Hedges pers. comm. 2008), but in these areas it was recorded rather rarely by comparison with other ungulates. Sambar was nearly six times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting, and reduced populations overall (O'Brien&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003). In Way Kambas National Park the population is reportedly stable (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Overall in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Sambar is not under major threat except where forest is being converted (i.e. most of the lowlands). Reflecting this, E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) considered the status of Sambar, in suitable habitat, to be much more healthy there than in Cambodia and Viet Nam, although there is a significant market for Sambar antlers in Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"The Sambar extends from India and Sri Lanka east along the southern Himalayas (including Nepal and Bhutan) through much of south China (including Hainan Island) to Taiwan (where it occurs in the central and eastern parts; Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comms. 2008). Further south it occurs in Bangladesh, throughout mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, West Malaysia) and many of the main islands of the Greater Sundas (excepting Java): Sumatra, Siberut, Sipora, Pagi and Nias islands (all Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) (Grubb 2005). The current distribution is now highly fragmented in much of this range (see Population). Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) also listed the Philippines, but the Sambar does not occur there. A record from Ujung Kulon, Java, in van Schaik and Griffiths (1996: 107) is presumably an error for Javan Deer <em>R. timorensis</em>. The Sambar has been introduced widely outside its native range, e.g.: San Luis Obispo Country, California; the Gulf Prairies and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Ables and Ramsey 1974); the St. Vincent Islands, Franklin Country, Florida (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1990); Australia (Slee 1984, Freeland 1990); New Zealand (Kelton and Skipworth 1987); and Western Cape Province, South Africa (Lever 1985). These introduced populations are not included on the distribution map.","The Sambar is hunted for sport, food, medicinal products and other purposes. It is uncertain how many captive animals are kept within the native range, potentially larger herds occur in countries where introduced, and the comparative contributions of wild and captive sourced products to markets is unknown - the markets may be somewhat separate.",Terrestrial,"The Sambar is found in many protected areas throughout its range, although in most of these areas this legal status has not stemmed declines and local extinctions from hunting. Similarly, although it is protected from hunting by legislation, even outside protected areas, in most or all range states, these laws are challenging to enforce, given the trade demand for meat and antlers (GMA Indonesia Workshop).&#160;In Sarawak, Borneo, unfortunately,&#160;Sambar&#160;is not on the protected list of Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1998 (a,b) (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Currently the law has a strong protective effect in Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008) and in various protected areas of India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, Sambar declines have lagged behind those of other sympatric deer (excepting muntjacs). There is no doubt that within a decade or two Sambar will be, like Hog Deer and Eld’s Deer are already, almost absent from South-east Asia unless effective protection from trade-driven hunting is instituted. In India the species’s status is less grim, and this is dependent upon continuation of the current protected areas system, and the expansion of effective threat reduction into a greater proportion of protected areas: in many Indian protected areas, poaching is rampant and in such vulnerable areas Sambar numbers are still declining. Given the major challenges combating hunting of such a desired animal, long-term survival is most realistic in large protected areas (exceeding 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> where possible), lacking people living within them, with an adequate number of motivated and capable staff (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008, A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). The precise ways for protected areas to function effectively in the conservation of large mammals depend upon their own specific circumstances, but field presence of staff, dispersed across the area, is likely to be important in almost every area. For example, Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2006) found in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, that encounter rates of tracks and signs of Sambar (and other large mammals) decreased with distance from ranger substations. Deep inside the forest to the south and east, far away from ranger substations, Sambar was locally extinct. Similar patterns are shown by current Sambar distributions in other Thai protected areas such as Khao Sok, Phu Khieo and Kaeng Krachan (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Sambar (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Sambar populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that outmigration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai. Most of the remaining forest within its Chinese range are already established as nature reserves (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Sambar population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Sambar presence through its historical range, to preserve Sambar genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/><p>The most important conservation measure for Sambar in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, and in Thailand it is to to expand government-funded park protection and ranger training programmes outside of the few parks which are currently well supported in the Western Forest Complex. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Sambar conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Nam Et–Phou Louey, and Nakai–Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species, but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Sambar conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Sambar as the focus for efforts.<br/> <br/> Captive breeding is being developed in East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). A captive herd of 223 heads in 10 ha enclosure was established in 1998 in Penajam District, as a pilot project. Several private herds exist in the province, such as at Bearau and at Nunukan, both with more than 20 heads (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Captive Sambar herds are also widespread in mainland Asia.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The species is inferred to have experienced a population size decline of at least 80% over the last 24 years (three generations; Nadler&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007) due to severe and persistent and ongoing persecution for the pet trade (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010), in combination with habitat loss.","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species is nocturnal and arboreal, and is found in secondary disturbed forest, in plantations and to some extent in primary forests.

Although often seen alone, social pairs and trios can occur, as can adult infant/juvenile pairs. Occurs from sea level to 2,300 m, although it is less common at higher elevations. This species has been observed to go into torpor at higher elevations (Nekaris, 2014).

Together with other loris species,&#160;<em>N. javanicus</em>&#160;is one of&#160;the most common protected primates found in animal markets in Java (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Thorn&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). Due to their non-leaping locomotion, their choice of sleeping sites in trees and bamboo that can be cut through and accessed, and nocturnal habits, the animals are easily caught by humans (Nekaris and Starr 2015). The majority of the trade is to satisfy a large domestic demand, with a smaller proportion being smuggled abroad to destinations like the Middle East and Japan (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2015). From there the species may appear on online videos which perpetuate the pet trade (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). The trade chain poses a perilous threat for many reasons. Conditions during transport (stuffed in boxes or sacks) and inappropriate husbandry techniques (poor diet and social housing, forced diurnal activity, excessive handling) afterwards result in large mortality rate. Slow Lorises are the only venomous primates; to avoid their bites middle men or traders cut or remove teeth, a process that almost invariably leads to the animal’s death (Nekaris and Starr 2015). If confiscated, reintroduction to the wild has proven difficult. Animals with no teeth are not viable candidates, and in a two-year study of 11 healthy radio-collared animals released, only two are known to have survived (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">  </span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hybridization poses a real threat both on Java and elsewhere.

Javan slow lorises have been observed on animal markets outside Java (e.g., Medan, Bandar Lampung on Sumatra) and other Indonesian slow loris species (<em>N. coucang</em>,&#160;<em>N. menagensis</em>) have been observed to Javan markets. Due to the morphological similarity of&#160;<em>Nycticebus</em>&#160;spp. misidentification is rife. Furthermore, there is a general feeling that ‘if it is a slow loris, release it.’ Not only does this pose welfare risks to the individual, but also translocated individuals may harbour infections and parasites, and could potentially hybridize (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Schulze and Groves 2004).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species has been recorded at very low densities (0.02-0.20/km) (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008).

Some small isolated populations persist in gardens and agricultural lands where they are at high risk from hunting and easily poached for the pet trade; severe population declines in these habitats have been documented&#160;(Wirdateti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, 2011; Voskamp <em>et al</em>., 2013). A specific survey in Gunung Gede Pangrango reported a density of 15.6 individuals/km², with a calculation that some 70 slow lorises occupy the study area (Nekaris <em>et al</em>., 2014). Based on the results of the survey, a very slow walking speed was deemed important in being able to detect slow lorises. More recently Nekaris and colleagues (unpublished) surveyed East Java, increasing the geographic range of <em>N. javanicus, </em>finding it at sites including Tumpang Pitu Forest, Meru Betiri National Park and Salakan Forest.<br/><br/>The population is inferred to have declined by over 80% over the last three generations (24 years) due to exploitation and declining availability of suitable habitat; less than 20% of suitable habitat suitable for <em>Nycticebus javanicus</em> remains.

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

97212355,11509,Leopardus pardalis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Ocelot has a wide distribution, from northern Argentina to the southwestern United States, being the most common felid species in most of the tropical and subtropical habitats of the Neotropics; it is listed as Least Concern. Densities seem to increase with rainfall and decrease with latitude, with the highest densities in tropical areas (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2008). Even though there are indications of specific population declines, these do not seem to affect the species to the point of categorizing it under any threat category rangewide. Its extensive occurrence in Brazil, added to the remaining area of present distribution allows an effective population of &gt;40,000 mature individuals (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). At least in some areas of the Amazon basin, populations are apparently healthy and stable. The species is, nevertheless, impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, intense logging activities, vehicle collisions and poaching (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2008, Payan <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia, Ocelots manage to survive in oil palm landscapes and extensive cattle ranches in the llanos and Inter-Andean valleys (Boron and Payan 2013, Diaz-Pulido and Payan 2011). In Argentina, the species still is found in all the subtropical area and although it is affected by poaching and logging (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, 2008, 2010), a total of 1,500 to 8,000 individuals is estimated for this country at the southern range of the species (Aprile <em>et al.</em> 2012). Populations of northeastern Mexico and Texas have experienced dramatic declines and the genetic impacts of isolation are apparent, particularly in Texas (Janecka <em>et al.</em> 2011 and Janecka <em>et al.</em> 2014). The number of Ocelots in Texas is believed to be between 50 – 80 individuals. These areas will certainly need attention or Ocelots are likely to be extirpated there.","The species occupies a wide spectrum of habitats types, ranging from scrublands to tropical rain forests. What all these habitats have in common is a well-structured vegetation cover (Emmons 1988, Emmons <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Ocelots were recorded in mangrove forests, coastal marshes, savanna grasslands, thorn scrubs, and tropical and subtropical forest (primary, secondary, evergreen, seasonal and montane). The species typically occurs at elevations below 3,000 m but there are occasional reports of the species up to 3,000 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>The Ocelot is a medium sized felid (11 kg), with a litter size of 1.4 kittens (1–4), and typically nocturno-crepuscular activity, but that could also be active during daytime (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Di Bitetti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Throughout much of its range tends to be the most abundant cat species. The Ocelot also reaches higher density estimates than its sympatric smaller species and was suggested that also negatively impact its small guild members (Di Bitetti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). The species use similar habitat and show similar abundance patterns than Jaguars and Pumas and appear not to be affected by these species (Di Bitetti et al 2010, Davis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011)&#160; Its diet includes small mammals, birds and reptiles, but include also larger sized prey (&gt;800 g), such as agoutis, armadillos, pacas, monkeys, etc. that in some areas can constitute the most important items (Crawshaw 1995, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Moreno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Bianchi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010)<br/><br/>The home ranges of males are larger than the ranges of the sympatric females, but high variation exist on the size between regions (Dillon and Kelly 2008).&#160; The largest home ranges (43 km² for males and 16 km² for females) were observed in Subtropical forest of Brazil and Argentina (Crawshaw 1995) and the smallest (2 to 6 km² for males and 1 to 3 km² for females) were observed in Texas (US), Brazilian Pantanal, Peruvian Amazonia and Bolivian Chaco (Navarro 1985, Emmons 1988, Crawshaw and Quigley 1989, Laack 1991, Maffei and Noss 2008).","At present the major threats for the species are habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry and illegal trade of pets and pelts (Sunquist and Sunquiest 2002).The Ocelot has been described as being tolerant in some degree to habitat disturbs and persists in wooded patches near human settlements. However, Ocelot abundance is negatively affected by anthropogenic effects like poaching and logging (Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Although widespread commercial harvests for the fur trade ceased decades ago, some illegal trade still persists.","Ocelot population densities throughout its entire range varies widely from 2.5 to 160/100 km². At a continental scale, Ocelot densities decrease with latitude and increase with rainfall (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Primary productivity seems to determine the abundance of this wild cat across their range, but at a local scale their abundance may be affected by logging and poaching or by competition with other species (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). The lowest densities are found at the Pine Forest of Belize (Dillon and Kelly 2007), dry areas of Mexico (Gonzalez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003) and the Caatinga in northeastern Brazil (Oliveira 2012). The maximum estimated density was found at the Barro Colorado Island in Panamá (Rodgers <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).

97216466,18868,Puma concolor,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern because it is one of the most widely-distributed mammals in the Western Hemisphere. Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey <em>et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014). In Brazil it is considered Near Threatened but subspecies outside the Amazon basic are considered Vulnerable (Machado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).

107263066,41586,Lycalopex fulvipes,Endangered,C1,2016,2016-03-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Darwin’s Fox is endemic to Chile. The species occurs on a large extent of Chiloé Island and in Nahuelbuta National Park (Jiménez and MacMahon 2004). Surveys have revealed that the species is also present on private properties with well-preserved native forests outside of Nahuelbuta National Park. Until recently these were the only known populations for the species, with the exception of a skin found in Punta Chanchán, midway between Nahuelbuta and Chiloé (Vila&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). However, the recent finding of a Darwin’s Fox killed by a dog near Gorbea (D’Elia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013) and several records in three protected areas in the Valdivian Coastal Range (Farías&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) have confirmed a larger extent of occurrence than previously reported (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of individuals has also been confirmed north of Llanquihue Lake, on the foothills of the Andes and approximately 60 km east to the coastal mountain range (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The Darwin’s Fox was previously classified in 2004 and 2008 as Critically Endangered based on an estimated population size of “less than 250 mature individuals with at least 90% of the population occurring in one subpopulation” (Chiloé&#160;Island) (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). New distribution information (Vila <em>et al</em>. 2004, D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs., A. Farías pers. obs.) indicates that the extent of occurrence of the species is much larger than originally thought and clearly exceeds the threshold for listing it as threatened under criterion B. No reliable population data are available, although foxes seem to be more abundant and to occur at higher densities in Chiloé than on the mainland (J. Jiménez and A. Farías pers. obs.). A very conservative minimum estimate suggests at least 412 and 227 mature individuals occur on Chiloé and on the mainland, respectively. Based on this estimate, the species does not meet the thresholds for listing it as Critically Endangered under criterion C or for listing as Critically Endangered or Endangered under criterion D. Despite the conservative minimum estimate, it is nonetheless likely that total population size does not exceed 2,500 mature individuals and hence the species would meet the threshold for listing as Endangered under criterion C. Since the subpopulation on&#160;Chiloé&#160;very likely exceeds 250 mature individuals, it cannot meet subcriteria C2a(i) or C2a(ii).&#160;However, the combined impacts of forest loss and the risk posed by domestic dogs (especially of contracting Canine Distemper Virus, a risk supported by high seroprevalence in dog populations in areas inhabited by Darwin’s Fox [Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015b]), and the evidence for the impacts of these threats on populations, suggest a high likelihood that the population could undergo a decline exceeding 20% in the coming 6-8 years (two generations). Hence the species would meet the subcriteria for listing as EN under C1. It is acknowledged that this assessment might be slightly precautionary if the likelihood or rate of decline is overstated. In that case, the species would at least be listed as Vulnerable as it meets the threshold for listing as Vulnerable under criterion C, and based on the minimum estimate of subpopulation size for Chiloé would also meet subcriterion C2a(i). In summary, the species is considered to qualify for listing as Endangered under criterion C1.","<p>Early research in Nahuelbuta suggested Darwin's Foxes were associated with dense forest (Jaksic <em>et al</em>. 1990, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1991). More recent radio-telemetry data indicate that animals are found more often in dense <em>Araucaria</em>-<em>Nothofagus</em> forest, open <em>Nothofagus</em> forest and occasionally in open pastures (McMahon <em>et al</em>. 1999). Preliminary data on camera trapping 20 km north-west of Nahuelbuta National Park indicate a similar pattern of occupancy of habitat types (J. Jiménez pers. obs.). More recently, Darwin’s Foxes in Nahuelbuta have been found to be positively associated with native forest availability, and negatively associated with roads (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a). Positive response of foxes to fine grain habitat structure suggests commercial plantations may also provide complementary habitat and food resources for this diet-generalist species in Nahuelbuta (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015b). They have been recorded to ~1,400 m elevation in Nahuelbuta (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>In the coastal range of Los Ríos Region, Darwin’s Foxes have been primarily recorded in old-growth and secondary evergreen forests, though they were also detected in unmanaged <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. plantations (Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014). Foxes are apparently more frequent in the southern area of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, an area that was less impacted by forest substitution and that have lower human (and dog) densities than the northern area (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Finally, records near the Llanquihue Lake were in a highly fragmented forest with intensive dairy farms having large pastures with linear strips of degraded Valdivian forest along streams (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>In Chiloé, foxes use a variety of habitats. A study conducted in Chiloé, found that foxes used second-growth forests and scrublands according to availability, old-growth forest less than expected according to availability and that the use of dunes varied between individuals (Jiménez 2007). The consumption of crustaceans and direct observation provides evidence that sandy beaches are also used by this species (Elgueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jiménez 2007). In the north-east of the island, where the forest is fragmented, Darwin’s Fox occur in the larger forest fragments (Farías and Jaksic 2011). Home ranges vary between 103 and 488 ha (Jiménez 2007).</p>","<p>Domestic dogs and associated diseases are likely the main threats for Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez&#160;and McMahon 2004). Dogs are a common problem in Chilean protected areas, including each of those where the Darwin’s Fox is present. Domestic dogs would represent a risk for foxes through intra-guild killing, as well as through disease transmission (Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Cabello <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b). The death of Darwin’s Foxes due to dog attacks has been reported both on the mainland (D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013) and in Chiloé (Espinosa 2011, J. Jiménez pers. obs.). Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015a) found a negative correlation between the areas used by dogs and foxes in Nahuelbuta. Accordingly, in Chiloé Island, Darwin’s Foxes are rare or absent from old-growth forests frequently visited by dogs, while they are frequently recorded at camera traps in scrublands when dogs are absent (A. Farías pers. obs.), suggesting spatial displacement.&#160;It is important to note that the dog problem that affects Darwin’s Foxes, is caused in most, if not all, cases by poorly managed free-ranging dogs and not feral dogs (D. Moreira pers. obs., E.A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The risk of disease spillover from dogs (mainly Canine Distemper Virus, CDV) is considered a major threat for Darwin’s Fox populations (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Exposure of dogs to CDV has been shown in the proximity of Nahuelbuta National Park (Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015b) and Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Furthermore, exposure to CDV has been reported for invasive American minks (<em>Neovison vison</em>) in areas were the Darwin’s Fox is present (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014), as well as for Chilla (<em>Lycalopex griseus</em>) and Culpeo (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>) in other regions (Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Additionally, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported the death of three radio-collared foxes in Chiloé in sympatry with free-ranging dogs, suggesting that mortality could have been caused by CDV, although conclusive evidence was not available. CDV epizootics in canids have been reported worldwide (e.g., Goller <em>et al</em>. 2010, Di Sabatino <em>et al</em>. 2014), and CDV was implicated in a major decline in the population of the Island Fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) in Santa Catalina Island (Timm <em>et al</em>. 2009). In South America, Megid <em>et al</em>. (2009, 2010) reported CDV-related mortalities in wild canids in Brazil, and in Chile, Moreira and Stutzin (2005) reported the death of 27 Chilla and Culpeo foxes due to CDV in Coquimbo Region. The lack of conclusive evidence of declines due to CDV in the Darwin’s Fox may be well explained by lack of information, rather than by the absence of outbreaks.<br/><br/>Darwin’s Foxes can also be subject to human-caused mortality. According to J. Jiménez (pers. obs.) and Espinosa (2011), local people in Chiloé reported killing foxes because they attack domestic animals and to obtain their fur. Foxes rescued from traps as well as captured and translocated after predation on poultry have also been reported in Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.). Stowhas (2012) also indicated that local people reported killing foxes (undetermined species) in an area that included the surroundings of Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park, and Valdivian Coastal Reserve, as a response to predation on poultry. In Nahuelbuta range, foxes (without distinguishing to the level of species) are often considered as problem animals (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, Darwin’s Fox is not commonly persecuted or killed by local people (but see McMahon <em>et al</em>. 1999) and its conservation would show a high social support (D. Moreira pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Forest loss is an important threat. The highest rates of forest loss occur in the coastal range of the Araucanía Region, where Nahuelbuta is located. There, the annual loss rate observed for the 1999-2008 period reached 4.8%, the second highest reported for Chilean temperate forest (Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the Valdivian Coastal Range, the net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (and the gross loss reached 30%), but the loss rate was higher for the 1985-1999 period than for the 1999-2011 period (Zamorano-Elgueta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In northern Chiloé and Maullín, the annual rates of forest loss was close to 1% (1985-2007), although in the case of Chiloé this rate rose to 1.4% for the 1999-2007 period (Echeverría <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both in the Araucanía and Valdivian cases, cleared native forest was frequently converted to forestry plantations (Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although Darwin’s Fox has been recorded in plantations (Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), evidence from the population in Nahuelbuta shows that foxes select for native forest (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a). However, if managed through an increase of native understory cover, commercial plantations may provide complementary habitats and food resources for this species (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015b). Human-induced fires are an always-latent threat, especially for the Nahuelbuta range (D. Moreira pers. obs.). On the other hand, deforestation may favour other (larger sized) fox species (i.e. <em>Lycalopex</em>&#160;<em>griseus </em>and <em>L. culpaeus</em>), better adapted to open areas (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2010), which can displace Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1991). The indirect effects of changes in land cover through alteration of interaction webs are still insufficiently known.<br/><br/>Indirect threats that need to be considered include the construction of bridges, highways and roads. Of major concern is the projected construction of the bridge connecting Chiloé to the mainland. This bridge, if barriers are not implemented, may facilitate the invasion of the island by other species such as congeneric foxes and Pumas (<em>Puma concolor</em>), with unknown, but potentially serious consequences for these populations. Road construction and improvement is an additional concern, given that they facilitate dog (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a, Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2015) and human movement, and can lead to land cover change (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2005). Existing roads, as well as the construction of new roads and/or the improvement of existing public roads, is a concern for Nahuelbuta (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015) and for Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Other threats that need to be taken into account include the translocation of rescued and problem animals (J. Cabello pers. obs.) and illegal tenure of foxes as pets (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).</p>","<p>In Ahuenco, Chiloé, Jiménez (2007) estimated a density of 0.92 foxes/km²&#160;in an area that seems to be prime for the species. In Nahuelbuta, D. Moreira <em>et al</em>. (pers. obs.) have recently found that foxes are patchily distributed across the landscape reaching densities of <em>c.</em> 0.75 foxes/km²&#160;in areas with less disturbed native forest. Foxes are described as common in Chiloé, except for the northern and eastern areas of the island (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of foxes seems to be largely explained by native forest (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Farías and Jaksic (2011) report for north-eastern Chiloé (likely among the less suitable area for foxes in the island, Jiménez and McMahon 2004) that occupancy was associated with fragment size, with larger fragments mostly occupied. Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015a) report occupancy of 32% for Nahuelbuta (around 10% of cameras with detections). Preliminary data from the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and Alerce Costero National Park (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs., A. Farías and Svensson pers. obs.) suggests similar detection rates than for Nahuelbuta. Genetic variability is extremely low for both populations, and despite its presumed larger population size, is lower in Chiloé than in mainland (J. Cabello <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Polymorphism in animals from Chiloé is lower than in other species (Cabello and Dávila 2014).<br/><br/>Jiménez and McMahon (2004) estimated that the extant Darwin’s Fox population was 78 individuals for Nahuelbuta National Park (and less than 100 for the Nahuelbuta range) and around 500 in Chiloé.&#160;For the purpose of this account a conservative approach was used to obtain an educated guess of the minimum population size of the Darwin’s Fox. Foxes were assumed to occupy 32% of the areas defined in the geographic range (see above). This number derives from the study in Nahuelbuta mentioned above (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2015a), and is considered conservative especially when applied to Chiloé for three reasons. First, occupancy was not modelled at the home-range scale, but rather based on camera trap points; it is expected that increasing grain to the home range scale will also increase occupancy estimates. Second, Nahuelbuta is the northern limit of the distribution and the condition of the habitat is less favourable than in other areas such as Chiloé (J. Jiménez and D. Moreira pers.&#160;obs.), thus lower densities are expected in&#160;Nahuelbuta. Third, Nahuelbuta is located in an area that has been severely affected by land conversion (see Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015), likely representing the most disturbed area within the current distribution of this fox. We then assumed that in occupied areas the density of mature foxes was 0.2 foxes/km². This number was calculated (1/488) from the largest home range (488 ha) reported in Jiménez (2007) and assumes that mature foxes do not have overlapping home ranges, an assumption that is extremely conservative as Jiménez (2007) showed high home range overlap (and a density of 0.92 foxes/km²). This procedure was equivalent to applying a density of 6.6 foxes/100 km². We did not attempt to estimate an upper limit of the population size. As a result we estimated a minimum of 412 mature individuals for Chiloé and 227 mature individuals for the areas in mainland where the fox is known to be present. If considering the areas where the fox is potentially extant, the minimum population size in mainland would approach 489 individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"Darwin’s Fox is endemic to Chile occurring in at least two distinct populations (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). One is found in the forests of Chiloé Island, while the second population is on the coastal range in mainland Chile. The mainland population is apparently discontinuous. Until recently, the fox was known to occur only in the Nahuelbuta range (e.g., Medel<em> et al.</em> 1990, Jiménez and McMahon 2004). However, recent records confirm the presence of the species in the Valdivian coastal range (Vila <em>et al</em>. 2004, D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014), including at least three protected areas: Alerce Costero National Park, the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (both ca. 40°05'S, 73°30'W), and the Oncol Park (39°42'S, 73°18'W). Nahuelbuta and the Valdivian Coastal Range are separated by heavily disturbed landscapes. A recent record near Maullín (41°27'S, 73°48'W) (A. Farías, pers. obs.) suggests that the species is potentially extant between Bueno River and Maullín. Finally, a few individuals detected in 2014 north of Llanquihue Lake&#160;(40°53'S, 72°50'W, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), on the foothills of the Andes, would suggest that the range of this species is larger than thought, although it cannot be ruled out that such individuals belong to the same subpopulation as those in the coastal range.&#160;In summary, the fox is considered to be extant in the following areas (see map): Nahuelbuta-Caramávida, Lastarria, Oncol-Chanchán, Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park and surrounding forest, Maullín and Puerto Octay. Darwin’s Fox is potentially extant in the forested areas between the Bueno River and Maullín and the forested areas north to Mehuín (between Gorbea and Chanchán records).","There is no commercial use of this species. However, some animals have been illegally kept in captivity as pets (Jiménez and McMahon 2004), and there is some limited off-take for fur (Espinosa 2011).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Legislation<br/></strong>Included on CITES - Appendix II. Protected by Chilean law since 1929 (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986). Darwin’s Fox is listed as endangered in Chile (DS 151/2007 MINSEGPRES). Since 2012, the Ministry of the Environment is working in the elaboration of the Recovery, Conservation and Management plan for the species (RECOGE for its Spanish acronym), but this plan is not in effect yet.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in protected areas<br/></strong>The Darwin’s Fox occurs in the following public protected areas: Nahuelbuta National Park (Araucanía Administrative Region), Alerce Costero National Park (Los Ríos Administrative Region), and Chiloé National Park (Los Lagos Administrative Region). In addition, the species is found in the following private protected areas: Caramávida Reserve (Biobío Administrative Region), Oncol Park and Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Los Ríos Administrative Region), and Tantauco, Ahuenco and Tepuhueico Parks (Los Lagos Administrative Region). Some of these protected areas are targeting the species through monitoring, supporting research or attempting to address the dog problem (e.g., Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Darwin’s Fox is one of the conservation targets (Darwin’s Fox, guigna and pudu) of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Following the criteria by Simonetti and Mella (1997), and the densities reported by Jiménez (2007), it is possible to assume that good quality areas of around 550 km²<sup>&#160;</sup>in size could sustain ~500 individuals (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2015). Tantauco Park in Chiloé, and the area protected by the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and Alerce Costero National Park as a whole, are the only protected areas that meet this criterion, although this does not guarantee the existence of such a number of foxes, as they appear to be scarcer in the Valdivian population (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez and A. Farías, pers. obs.), and the density of foxes in Ahuenco could be much higher than in other areas (Jiménez 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Species-based measures<br/></strong>Vaccination of dogs against CDV has been conducted around some of the above-mentioned protected areas with the aim of preventing disease outbreaks that could affect Darwin’s Foxes (e.g., Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.).

Key topics under study include genetics (J. Cabello pers. obs.), disease (E. Hidalgo pers. comm.), occupancy and habitat use (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). The later topic still deserves clarification regarding (1) the presence of the species between the Bueno and Maullín rivers (i.e. coastal mountain range of Osorno Province), (2) its potential presence in the Andes and lowlands between the Andes and the Coastal Range, and (3) under-explored areas in continental Chiloé. Furthermore, accurate information is needed regarding the abundance of the species in each of these populations.<br/><br/>Key issues that need to be addressed include the management of domestic dogs. Irresponsible ownership is the rule rather than the exception in Chile. Despite long legislative discussion, no serious solution is in place for this problem. Effective enforcement of responsible ownership is absolutely necessary to address this problem. Recently CONAF passed some rules that limit the entrance of dogs to protected areas (CONAF 2015), but these measures need to be supported by a coherent legislation.<br/><br/>The adequate management of exotic plantations is an important priority. Recent studies suggest that several forest species can use forest plantations if they have dense native understory (Simonetti <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thus, leaving understory in exotic tree plantations may be key to maintain connectivity in Darwin’s Fox populations, especially in Nahuelbuta (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2016). The challenge is to implement these recommendations.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
110023718,714,Ailurus fulgens,Endangered,A2cde+3cde+4cde,2015,2015-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Red Panda is listed as Endangered because its population has plausibly&#160;declined by 50% over the last three generations (estimated at 18 years) and this decline is projected to continue, and probably intensify, in the next three generations. There is no credible quantification of decline rate from anywhere in the species' range. The overall forest loss rate at appropriate altitudes&#160;in the species' range is suspected to be sufficient for Near Threatened status (about 25% in the last three generations), but Red Panda populations are suspected to be declining much faster, reflecting a battery of direct threats, this species' fragmented present range, and poor survival in fragmented areas. (1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

112910221,4037,Catopuma badia,Endangered,C1,2016,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Borneo Bay Cat, a Bornean endemic, remains one of the least known and infrequently recorded of the world’s wild cats, hindering efforts to assess its conservation needs and status. Historical records, incidental observations, and more recently, camera trap photographic captures and a niche modelling exercise (Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> submitted) indicate that this elusive felid appears restricted to natural and semi-natural forest cover but, within such habitat, exhibits some degree of habitat plasticity. Importantly, however, the extensive areas of swamp forest and oil palm plantations on Borneo do not appear to be used by this felid. A Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based habitat suitability analysis, using presence-only data coupled with expert opinion, estimated that the Bay Cat’s current area of occupancy (AOO) extends to approximately 221,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Borneo Carnivore Symposium 2011, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> submitted). Due to a lack of sufficient data, this analysis was unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range. Hunting could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO. A GIS exercise as part of the current assessment used the habitat suitability assessment alongside landcover data for Borneo for the years 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) and showed that the estimated AOO decreased by 29.8% during this time period, primarily as a result of forest loss and conversion to oil palm. More recent satellite imagery shows that forest loss has continued to reduce the AOO in size (Gaveau <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), and it is likely that forest loss continues to this day, albeit at a reduced rate. In addition, some protected areas in Borneo are small, fragmented and isolated making them vulnerable to climate change and ineffective in conserving low-density species such as the bay cat (Scriven <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Because the species spends time on the ground, Bay Cats are prone to untargeted snaring and there is increasing evidence for the capture and export of Bay Cats for the illegal pet market. We estimate that the cumulative reduction in the population size as a consequence of degradation, poaching amounts and forest conversion, to between 20-30% in the past 12 years (two Bay Cat generations, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>No population density estimates exist for this felid. Nevertheless, the paucity of Bay Cat specimens collected during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries caused earlier authors to conclude that the species is naturally rare, a stance further bolstered by recent camera survey efforts. Indeed, photographic capture rates of the Bay Cat are substantially lower than that of the sympatric Sunda Clouded Leopard (<em>Neofelis diardi</em>), which is estimated to exist at low densities (1-4 individuals 100 km<sup>2</sup>: Brodie and Giordano 2012a, Wilting <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Loken <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpublished data) leading some authors to hypothesize that the Bay Cat is found at even lower densities (Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, but see Wearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure and a patchy distribution, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Bay Cat across the AOO may be as low as one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals could plausibly be fewer than 2,500 individuals indicating, in combination with the estimated past decline rate (&gt;30% in the past 12 years), a categorization of Endangered under EN C1.","The Borneo Bay Cat appears to be forest dependent, with records from hill and lowland forest as well as swamp forest (Meijaard 1997, Azlan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Hearn 2003, Bricknell 2003, Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Yasuda <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> submitted). It has been recorded from selectively logged forest of various levels of disturbance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Kitchener <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Meijaard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Hon 2011, Wearn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Mathai <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), but was estimated to occur at lower local abundance in logged forests than in unlogged forest (Brodie <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). It was not recorded during an intensive, felid-focused camera trap survey of oil palm plantations in Sabah (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Yue <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press). It has never been the focus of any ecological study and there is no information about its diet (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It occurs in both a reddish and grey colour phase. The bay cat appears to be primarily diurnal in nature, although not strictly so (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Nothing is known regarding the spatial ecology of this felid.","Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations pose the greatest threat to the Bay Cat. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020 (Rautner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Poaching, particularly the use of snares, poses a significant threat. Wildlife traders are aware of the species' rarity, and Bay Cats have been captured illegally from the wild for the skin and pet markets (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Azlan and Sanderson 2007).","There are no population density estimates for the Borneo Bay Cat in any part of its range, yet this elusive felid has long been considered uncommon. Noting the paucity of specimens collected during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, earlier authors concluded that the species was naturally rare. Even now, the Bay Cat is known from only 12 specimens (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 2004), and incidental observations remain few and far between (Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Meijaard <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). Since the advent of intensive camera trap surveys, however, many of them targeted at felids, there has been a slow but steady rise in the number of photographic captures of this felid (Azlan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Yasuda 2007, Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Wearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Gardner <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data). Nevertheless, even intensive felid focused camera trap surveys yield very few photographs, and photographic capture rates of the bay cat are substantially lower than that of the sympatric Sunda Clouded Leopard (<em>Neofelis diardi</em>), which is estimated to exist at low densities (1-4 individuals 100 km<sup>2</sup>: Brodie and Giordano 2012a, Wilting <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Sollmann <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Loken <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data). Such observations have led some authors to hypothesise that the Bay Cat is found at even lower densities (Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). It is unclear, however, whether this apparent lower detection rate is a reflection of true rarity or due to underlying factors that result in its elusiveness. Wearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>, (2013) compared photo-capture rates of Bay Cats from a number of studies in Borneo and showed that random placement of cameras can result in higher rates than that derived from targeted placement (trails, ridgelines, and logging roads), as is typical of camera trap surveys. Wearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013) suggested that the relative abundance of the bay cat may have hitherto been underestimated due to an underlying bias as a result of the use of non-random survey locations coupled with this felid’s particular use of space. A comparison of photo-capture rates between a randomised and a targeted survey of the Tawau Hills National Park in Sabah, however, found no evidence of elevated capture rates of this felid as a result of randomised camera deployment, and instead showed that a randomised survey approach reduced detection probability of all Bornean felids (Hearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>unpublished data).<br/><br/>It is important to highlight that while the increasing use of camera traps across the island of Borneo is slowly yielding more detections of this elusive cat, several intensive, felid-focused camera trap surveys have failed to detect this species (e.g., Tangkulap Forest Reserve, Segaliud Lokan Forest Reserve: Wilting <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data, Sepilok Forest Reserve: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data, numerous surveys in Kalimantan: Cheyne and Macdonald, unpublished data), despite a habitat suitability analysis (Bornean Carnivore Symposium, Hearn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> submitted) predicting the cat to be present. Our estimate of the Bay Cat’s current area of occupancy (AOO) must consequently be viewed with caution.<br/><br/>Although further research is needed to draw more firm conclusions regarding the abundance and distribution of the Borno Bay Cat, the assessors have chosen to follow a precautionary approach, and estimate that the mean density of the Bay Cat throughout its area of occupancy (AOO) is around one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Extrapolation of this density to the estimated AOO suggests the population is plausibly around 2,200 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The Borneo Bay Cat is endemic to the island of Borneo, and until recently, its distribution was poorly understood. Although somewhat hindered by the low number of Bay Cat records, Meijaard (1997) collated historical records and contemporary observations of the Bay Cat and speculated that this felid was, and possibly still is, widely distributed on Borneo, a proposition later supported by Azlan and Sanderson (2007). Bolstered by the increasing number of Bay Cat records obtained from chance sightings (Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Meijaard <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005) and the increasing, but still relatively few camera trap records (Azlan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Yasuda 2007, Mohamed <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Wearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press, Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data), a MaxEnt habitat suitability modelling approach was developed during the Borneo Carnivore symposium in 2011 from presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and landuse covariates to make predictions regarding the current distribution of Bay Cats (Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> submitted). In support of Meijaard (1997), Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em>’s (submitted) model predicted that an extensive, contiguous, forested area of interior Borneo, in addition to a number of more isolated forested fragments, amounting to approximately 221,000 km<sup>2</sup>, may be currently occupied by the Bay Cat. Due to a lack of data, the habitat suitability exercise was unable to account for the potential impact of differential hunting pressure throughout this range, which potentially could be having a considerable impact, and our estimate may therefore represent an overly optimistic estimation of the current area of occupancy (AOO). Recent records of the Bay Cat stem from the Malaysian states of Sabah (Kitchener <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Mohamed <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Wearn <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hearn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data) and Sarawak (Dinets 2003, Azlan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Hon 2011, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Mathai <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the Indonesian provinces of East (Yasuda <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Sastramidjaja <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), West (Hearn 2003, Meijaard <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005), and Central (Bricknell 2003) Kalimantan, and Brunei (J. Sanderson pers. comm.). No records of the Bay Cat have been made in South Kalimantan, yet it is unknown whether this represents a genuine absence or a lack of sufficient sampling effort.<br/><br/>The map presented as part of this assessment is largely based on this habitat suitability exercise, but small patches which were identified as non-habitat in the model output have been included here as habitat. In addition, the Tabin Wildlife Reserve, not included in the original model output, has been included here, based on recorded presence (Ross <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Gardner <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Most Bay Cat records are from below 800 m but Brodie and Giordano (2012b) describe two records from above 1,400 m in the Kelabit Highlands and Payne <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (1985) mention an unconfirmed record from 1,800 m on Mt.

It is fully protected by national legislation across most of its range. Hunting and trade are prohibited in Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

The Bay Cat remains to be one of the least studied of the world’s wild cats (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Brodie 2009), hampering the development of conservation actions. It is therefore essential to gain an understanding of this species’ distribution, abundance, and response to anthropogenic modification of its habitat in order to better understand it’s conservation status.

Country bear experts on the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group (representing all range countries except the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) estimated rates of population change for the past 30 years (three bear generations), and projected rates of change for the next 30 years (see Figure 2 in the attached Supplementary Material). These assessments were based on perceived levels of exploitation, loss and degradation of habitat, and changes in area of occupancy within their respective countries; no range countries have estimates of abundance or indices of abundance that are sufficient to document population trend. One country (Pakistan) obtained empirical estimates of a decline in occupancy of 33% in 30-40 years (Abbas <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Weighting each country’s estimate of population change by the country’s areal proportion of the geographic range yielded an overall estimated decline of 31% for the past 30 years.&#160; All countries that reported population declines also reported that these declines have not ceased. Thus, this species meets the criteria for Vulnerable. Projected decline was less (20-30%) for a 30-year window over-lapping the present, and for 30 years into the future.<br/> <br/> Estimates of population change for China have a very large influence on range-wide estimates because China comprises more than half the total range area. Forest area for China is increasing, but much of this reforestation is poor habitat for Asiatic Black Bears. Moreover, poaching levels are still reported to be high. Past trends in China were gleaned mainly from an extensive sign survey of occupied area combined with reports by local people in Sichuan Province, which is believed to harbour the largest numbers of Asiatic Black Bears. Projections into the future, though, are highly speculative, especially given uncertainty about future poaching pressure in China, which is largely motivated by bear bile, and may change with marketing of synthetically produced bile. Excluding China, the range-wide estimated rate of decline for the 30-year window including the present averages ~30%, and the projected rate for the next 30 years was 40%, indicating that the outlook for this species is getting worse in most of these other range countries.</p>","<p>Asiatic Black Bears occupy a variety of forested habitats, both broad-leaved and coniferous, from near sea level to an elevation of 4,300 m (in northeastern India and Sikkim; Sathyakumar and Choudhury 2007, Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2011). They also infrequently use open alpine meadows. A photo-capture was made in the alpine region of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Uttarakhand, India at 4,500 m (&gt;1,000 m above the mean tree line; S. Sathyakumar, Wildlife Institute of India, pers. comm., 2014). In some areas of Nepal, local people have reported Asiatic Black Bears at higher than normal elevations, possibly a result of climate change (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Individual bears move to different habitats and elevations seasonally (Izumiyama and Shiraishi 2004, Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2010), tracking changes in food abundance. In seasonal climates, foods include succulent vegetation (shoots, forbs and leaves) in spring, turning to insects and a variety of tree and shrub-borne fruits in summer, and hard mast (nuts) in autumn (Bromlei 1965, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1991, Hashimoto 2002, Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2002, Huygens <em>et al.</em> 2003, Koike 2010). In the tropics and subtropics, fruits are the mainstay year-round (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The diet may vary year to year with differences in food availability (Koike 2010), and this opportunistic species appears to be able to adapt its diet to gradually changing habitat conditions (Koike <em>et al.</em> 2013). In some places the diet includes a sizeable portion of meat from wild mammalian ungulates (which they either kill or scavenge, including tiger kills; Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2002, Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Narita <em>et al.</em> 2006), livestock (Abbas <em>et al</em>. 2015), ants (which they may forage upon for 7-8 hours per day; Yamazaki <em>et al</em>. 2012), or bees (Hashimoto 2002).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears also use regenerating forests, which may have a high production of berries or young bamboo shoots (Takahata <em>et al.</em> 2014). They also feed in plantations, where they may damage trees by stripping the bark and eating cambium (Yamazaki 2003, Yamada and Fujioka 2010), and in cultivated areas, especially corn and oat fields and fruit orchards (Carr <em>et al.</em> 2002, Mizukami <em>et al.</em> 2005, Gong and Harris 2006, Abbas <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> In southeastern Iran and Pakistan, this species occupies a very dry, sparsely-forested landscape (often called steppe forest or steppe woodland). This is the driest landscape inhabited by this species. Bears here use riparian areas, abandoned groves of date palm, and wild olive and pistachio forests (Ahmadzadeh <em>et al.</em> 2008, Ghadirian <em>et al.</em> 2012a). In some parts of this region, access to anthropogenic foods, particularly orchards (e.g., date palm, apricots, figs, walnuts), enable them to persist in a habitat with scarce natural food (Ghadirian 2012b). They use rock caves as shelters during daytime, and feed at night, possibly to avoid the sun or encounters with people in this very exposed habitat (Fahimi <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; By contrast, in more forested parts of the species’ range, they tend to be diurnally active (Hwang and Garshelis 2007) or crepuscular (Sharma <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears feed on a wide array of fleshy fruits and nuts. They were observed to feed on fruits from over 30 species of woody plants within a small, mountainous study site in Japan (Koike 2009). An equal dietary diversity was observed in a mountainous site in northern India (Sharma <em>et al. </em>2014). In tropical Thailand, dietary diversity was even greater: they were found to feed on fruits from least 30 families of trees (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/> <br/> Fruiting tree density is a good predictor of the occurrence and relative density of Asiatic Black Bears (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011, Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Thailand, these bears were noted to seek out rare fruits in the forest, possibly to diversify their diet (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Asiatic Black Bears are likely an important disperser of the seeds of some fleshy fruits (Sathyakumar and Viswanath 2003; Koike <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2010). They climb trees to eat fruits, and also eat fruits that drop to the ground. Sympatric Sun Bears also eat these same fruits. In Thailand, both species commonly feed on fruits in the cinnamon (Lauraceae) and pea (Fabaceae or Leguminosae) families.&#160; Both species live together in lowland habitats (&lt;1,200 m), but Asiatic black bears predominate at higher elevations (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> In temperate forests, Asiatic Black Bears rely heavily on hard mast in autumn, in part to attain sufficient fat reserves for winter denning (hibernation).&#160; Therefore, these bears tend to focus their activities in habitats with high abundance of oak acorns, beechnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, or stone pine seeds (Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1989, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2002, Hashimoto <em>et al</em>. 2003, Huygens <em>et al</em>. 2003). When Asiatic Black Bears feed in hard mast trees they often break branches and pile them up in the canopy, forming what appears to be a platform or “nest”. Males may socially exclude females, juvenile bears, and Sun Bars from rich stands of hard mast (Huygens and Hayashi 2001, Hwang <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2010, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011, Koike <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2012). When hard mast is poor, these bears expand their home ranges to find alternate fall foods (Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kozakai <em>et al</em>. 2011, Koike <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Japan, hard mast failures have led to massive intrusions of bears into residential areas, where they seek anthropogenic foods as a substitute (Oka <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oi and Furusawa 2008).<br/> <br/> In northern latitudes, where food becomes unavailable in winter, or in high altitudes covered by snow, both sexes hibernate. Therefore, Asiatic Black Bears hibernate throughout their range in Russia, Korea, Japan and northeastern China, and in high elevation areas of more southerly range states. Bears enter dens as early as October and as late as late-December; when hard mast is poor, den entry is earlier (Kozakai <em>et al</em>. 2013). They exit dens as early as mid-March to as late as the end of May (Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2003, Koike and Hazumi 2008). They den in rock crevices, hollow trees or stumps, under upturned trees, in dug-out earthen dens, natural cavities under roots, or in ground nests. In a mature natural forest in Japan, they were reported denning inside hollow trees, with entrances above ground level (Hazumi <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Russia, Asiatic Black Bears selected flat river bottoms for denning (Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2003), whereas in central China they moved to high elevation rocky outcrops on steep slopes (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1991).&#160; Likewise in Japan, dens tended to be in remote, difficult to access mountainous areas (Huygens <em>et al.</em> 2001, Koike and Hazumi 2008). Hunters often have knowledge of the sorts of places and types of dens that the bears tend to use, and have been reported finding and killing bears in dens. Denning and active Asiatic Black Bears are also subject to predation by other Asiatic Black Bears, Brown Bears, and Tigers (Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears do not hibernate from the Himalayan foothills southward where food is available all year and not covered by snow. However, pregnant females den throughout the range (even where food is available and other bears remain active) because they give birth to altricial cubs during the winter (Hwang and Garshelis 2007).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears generally breed during June-July and give birth during November-March; however, timing of reproduction is not known for all portions of the range. Age of first reproduction is typically 4-5 years old, and they normally produce litters of 1 or 2 cubs every other year (at most) (Yamanaka <em>et al</em>. 2011). Maximum lifespan is over 30 years, but average lifespan is less in the wild. No data are available on survival rates or causes of mortality.</p><p>                     </p><p>&#160;</p>","<p>Habitat loss due to logging, expansion of agriculture and plantations, roadway networks and dams, combined with hunting for skins, paws and especially gall bladders are the main threats to this species.<br/> <br/> Habitat loss due to logging and conversion to agriculture is a major threat to bears in 9 of 18 range countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Russia. Of these countries, Myanmar stands out as it encompasses a relatively large portion (about 12%) of the global range, so habitat loss here will have a large impact on the global status of the species.<br/> <br/> Habitat loss and degradation is most severe in the southern portion of the range. In India, &lt;10% of the species’ range is within protected areas (PAs), and areas outside PAs are subject to development projects and extraction of wood for fuel and livestock fodder (Sathyakumar 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012). In Bangladesh, where forest cover is now &lt;7% of the land area, Asiatic Black Bears survive only in small remnant patches in the east, generally near the Myanmar and Indian borders. Cambodia and Myanmar, although still well forested (57% and 48%, respectively), are third and fourth in the world in the annual rate of loss of forested area (among countries occupied by black bears; North Korea and Pakistan have higher rates: FAO 2010). Thailand has lower forest cover (&lt;30%), but most of its remaining forests are within PAs, and three-fourths of these are occupied by black bears (Kanchanasakha <em>et al</em>. 2010). Forest area has recently been increasing in Viet Nam, but much of the present remaining natural forest is highly degraded from both legal and illegal lumbering (Nguyen Xuan Dang 2006, FAO 2010).<br/> <br/> Forest area is increasing rapidly in China, which is now first in the world in terms of area gained per year. This increasing forest area stems from mandated government programs aimed mainly toward reducing flooding and erosion; the replanted trees may or may not be particularly suitable for bears. However, good forest habitat does persist in northeastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Russia, and Japan. In Japan, Asiatic Black Bear range has expanded with increasing forest area and diminishing rural human populations (Oi and Yamazaki 2006, Takahata <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> Direct killing represents another potential threat. Local people in Nepal, for example, use meat, organs, and bile for food, for healing, to alleviate pain, or even to deter ghosts (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2012). The sustainability of this practice has never been measured.<br/> <br/> Commercial poaching is believed to be a major threat to bears in at least half the range countries, including China, Taiwan, Russia, India, and the five range countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam). Commercial poaching is likely to have especially severe synergistic effects where it coincides with logging and habitat encroachment (Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao, Russia), which increase access for poachers and concentrate bears in ever smaller and fragmented pockets.<br/> <br/> Poachers primarily seek gall bladders and paws. The market for bear paws appears to be increasing commensurate with an increasing number of wealthy people who find it within their means to indulge in this very expensive delicacy (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). In 2013, two seizures in two months recovered parts of 81 individual Asiatic Black Bears being smuggled (from Russia) into or within China (Servheen 2013). Such seizures probably represent a small portion of the actual trade in bear paws.<br/> <br/> The demand for these bear products has fuelled a growing network of international trade throughout Southeast Asia, fed through poaching of wild bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011). Though difficult to quantify because of its covert nature, bear poaching for the wildlife trade is clearly widespread. Hunting of bears for the wildlife trade was reported in over 70% (10 of 14) of the villages interviewed in a northeastern Lao National Protected Area, facilitated by wildlife dealers from Viet Nam who comb rural areas to place orders, supply weapons and ammunition, and transport the off-take (Scotson 2010). In parts of Nepal and Myanmar near the Chinese border, Asiatic Black Bears are among the top preferred species that are hunted commercially for sale of their body parts to China (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yadav 2012).<br/> <br/> It is difficult to evaluate the actual impacts of this trade on wild populations because reliable population estimates and assessments of trends of wild bear populations are unavailable (Garshelis 2002, 2006). Nevertheless, there is evidence that this commercially-driven trade in bear parts is unsustainable and therefore causing populations to decline. In Sichuan Province, which likely has the highest numbers of Asiatic Black Bears in China, bear abundance and distribution have been in steady decline according to opinions of local people, driven predominantly by illegal poaching for bear parts (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2011). Demand for wild bears drives poaching throughout Southeast Asia. Local inhabitants of a large Thai reserve perceived a 50% decline in Asiatic Black Bear abundance over the previous 20 years, due almost solely to commercial poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2006). Across four countries in Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR), relative abundance of Asiatic Black Bears determined from camera trapping was half that of Sun Bears (with which they are widely sympatric) on average, indicating much lower densities (Steinmetz 2011). Notably, areas with the most depleted black bear populations are also closer to the Chinese border (Steinmetz 2011). The Asiatic Black Bear is the most highly valued species for consumers of bear parts, and seizures of bear parts in Southeast Asia are almost exclusively from Asiatic Black Bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008).<br/> <br/> Use of cable snares to capture wildlife is widespread in Southeast Asia, and is particularly intensive in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Taiwan. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, 1,000s to 10,000s of snares have been removed from single protected areas within a few months (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013; B. Robichaud, pers. comm). Intensive snaring poses a serious threat to bears because they are often caught inadvertently even if snares are targeted at other species. For example, 8 of 15 bears observed by researchers in Taiwan had missing toes or paws from snares set for wild pigs and other wildlife (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2010). The recent discovery in Lao PDR of commercially-motivated snare lines designed specifically for bears (Scotson and Hunt 2012) points to increasing pressure on wild populations driven by international demand from the trade in bear parts.<br/> <br/> The capture of live bears presents yet another threat to this species. In several Southeast Asian countries Asiatic Black Bears are routinely confiscated from people attempting to raise them as pets, possibly originating from the poaching of their mother for the gall bladder and paws. In Pakistan, several thousand bears were taken from the wild for exhibitions (referred to as bear baiting) in which individual bears (with canines and claws removed) fight with dogs. This practice was made illegal in 2001, but continues to some extent surreptitiously. More commonly now, bears are used for “dancing”.<br/> <br/> Conflict between humans and black bears is a widespread problem that occurs across the range of the species: Iran (Ghadirian <em>et al.</em> 2012), Pakistan (Dar <em>et al.</em> 2009, Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012), India (Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Choudhury 2013), Nepal (Stubblefield and Shrestha 2007), Bhutan (Sangay and Vernes 2008; Sonam Wangchuk, Wildlife Conservation Division, Bhutan, pers. comm., 2014), Lao PDR (Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014), Thailand (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011), China (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011), and Japan (Kishimoto 2009). Human-bear conflicts have negative effects on both people and bears―they include losses to livestock, crops, and apiaries; human injuries and deaths; and killing of bears in defence or retribution. Crop raiding is often extensive especially where farm fields and orchards are close to forest, as in India, Bhutan, and Lao PDR, and large numbers of farmers have reported crop damage from black bears (Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rinzin <em>et al.</em> 2009, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Killing of Asiatic Black Bears in crop fields may be motivated more by the value of their parts than the protection of the crops (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2012, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> Human injuries and deaths sometimes occur at tragically high rates, especially in densely settled areas with abundant bears: in Sikkim state, India, at least 25 people were killed or injured by black bears during 2008-2013 (Choudhury 2013). In Honshu, Japan, about 80 people are injured annually, including a few deaths (Japan Bear Network 2011). Such conflicts commonly give rise to negative attitudes towards black bears (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2006, Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sakurai and Jacobson 2011). Human-bear conflict can be a source of significant bear mortality when local people or government authorities kill bears to reduce damage; in an extreme case, over 4,000 bears were killed as pests in Japan in 2006 (Kishimoto 2009), representing a significant portion of the country’s population of black bears.<br/> <br/> Protected areas are often too small to contain resident black bears. Black bears have large home ranges (&gt;100 km² in some areas; Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chongsomchai 2013), and their wide-ranging movements may bring them near or beyond the borders of protected areas, where they are more vulnerable to poaching and more likely to come into conflict with farmers (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2010, Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011, Choudhury 2013). The availability of natural foods also has a strong effect on whether bears roam outside protected areas. Periods of mast failure or low fruit availability can induce bears to seek human foods outside the forest (Kishimoto 2009, Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011). Black bear raiding of corn fields adjacent to a park in Thailand coincided with annual periods of low fruit availability, and resulted in some being killed by farmers (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>The only rigorous population estimates for this species have been produced in Thailand, based on mark–recapture with camera traps, using distinctive chest patterns (Ngoprasert <em>et al </em>2010; Higashide <em>et al. </em>2012, 2013) to identify individual bears.&#160;This work yielded density estimates in three study sites in Khao Yai National Park, ranging from 8-29 bears per 100 km² (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2013).&#160;Bear sign density was found to be correlated with estimates of bear density, so sign surveys conducted across the country may, in the future, yield a reasonably reliable country-wide population index and trend information.<br/> <br/> In the Lower Dachigam area of Dachigam National Park and surrounding agricultural landscapes in Kashmir, India, genetic analysis of hair samples revealed the presence of 109 unique individuals in an area of 650 km², or17 bears per 100 km² (Mukesh <em>et al. </em>2015). Notably, this is a particularly food-rich area.<br/> <br/> Others have used a variety of ad hoc procedures to generate rough country-wide estimates. Largest populations occur in China (government estimate: ~28,000; Gong and Harris 2006), Japan (government estimate: 12,000-19,000, with much wider confidence intervals; Ministry of the Environment 2011), India (5,000-7,000; Sathyakumar and Choudhury 2007), and Russia (5,000-7,000; Aramilev 2006). Although these country-wide estimates are large, small, isolated populations also exist. For example, Japan has one large metapopulation as well as a few, disjunct small populations (Horino and Miura 2000, Yamamoto <em>et al.</em> 2012). Northern Pakistan may contain as many as nine separate populations (Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). Thailand has a number of small populations inside protected areas, separated by expanses of agriculture (Kanchanasakha <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/> <br/> Countries with the smallest total numbers of Asiatic Black Bears are Iran (~100-200) and South Korea. Iran’s population has a relatively wide but disconnected distribution and occurs at very low density, due to the scarcity of suitable habitat.&#160;This population’s low genetic diversity and distinct genetic clade indicate that it has been small and disjunct for a long time (Yusefi 2013). South Korea’s population was nearly extirpated, but saved by a reintroduction program in Jirisan National Park, started in 2004 (Jeong <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;All of the reintroduced animals were radio-collared, so their fate is known.&#160; It is believed that there were about 40 bears in the Republic of Korea population in 2015.<br/> <br/> Population trend has been deduced from sign, interviews, changes in habitat, and evidence of poaching.&#160;Republic of Korea and Japan report stable to increasing populations, Bhutan and Thailand report stable populations, and India reports stable to declining populations. All other countries report probable declining numbers (no report from Democratic People's Republic of Korea).&#160;The most severe declines, estimated at &gt;60% in the past 30 years, were reported in Viet Nam and Bangladesh. However, Asiatic Black Bears have fared better than Bangladesh’s other native bear species, which have been extirpated (Sloth Bears) or nearly extirpated (Sun Bears) due to severe habitat deterioration (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Likewise, Sun Bears have disappeared from the only portion of their range in China (Yunnan province), whereas Asiatic Black Bears still remain there (Wen and Wang 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Fossil remains of the Asiatic Black Bear have been found in various sites in Europe, as far north as the Ural Mountains and Germany and west to France, dating from the early Pliocene to late Pleistocene (Erdbrink 1953, Kosintsev 2007, Baryshnikov and Zakharov 2013, Fourvel <em>et al</em>. 2014); however, in historic times the species has been limited to Asia. The western range limit is in southeastern Iran, inhabited by the so-called Baluchistan bear (<em>U. t.</em> <em>gedrosianus</em>) (Ahmadzadeh <em>et al. </em>2008, Ghadirian <em>et al. </em>2012). This small population is likely connected to the Baluchistan bear population in southern Pakistan. Disjunct populations of Asiatic Black Bears also occur in the more mountainous regions of northern Pakistan (Khan <em>et al. </em>2012) and Afghanistan (Ostrowski <em>et al. </em>2009). Eastward they continue within a narrow band along the foothills and south side of the Himalayas (up to treeline) across India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and then more widely distributed at lower elevations (generally &gt;70 m but occasionally to 20 m) in the hill states of northeastern India (Sathyakumar and Choudhury&#160;2007). They occur across mainland Southeast Asia, stretching south in Myanmar and Thailand to ~200 km north of the Malaysian border (Kanchanasakha <em>et al.</em> 2010); there are no records of Asiatic Black Bears ever existing in Malaysia. Over half the total range area of this species exists in China, especially in the south-central and southwestern parts of the country.&#160;This distribution includes portions of Tibet, from which the specific name, <em>thibetanus</em>, is derived. Smaller, remnant populations occur in eastern China. Another population cluster exists in northeastern China, the southern Russian Far East, and North Korea. A small isolated population exists in southern South Korea. They also live on the southern islands of Japan (Honshu and Shikoku) and on Taiwan and Hainan.&#160;Although they have been extirpated from large portions of their range, they remain in all 18 historic range countries.<br/> <br/> The distribution of the Asiatic Black Bear roughly coincides with forest distribution in southern and eastern Asia (FAO 2010), except that in central and southern India this species is replaced by the Sloth Bear (<em>Melursus ursinus</em>), in Malaysia it is replaced by the Sun Bear and north and west of the Russian Far East it is replaced by the Brown Bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>). However, the Asiatic Black Bear overlaps the ranges of each of these species, especially the Sun Bear in a large portion of Southeast Asia and small portions of northeast India. It also greatly overlaps the range of Giant Pandas (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) in south-central China. In Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, the Asiatic Black Bear range overlaps the Brown Bear (at elevations &gt;3,000 m) in the Himalayas (but curiously, does not appear to overlap Brown Bears in Nepal (A. Aryal, Massey University, New Zealand, pers. comm, 2016; Bista and Aryal 2013). It also overlaps Brown Bears in south-central and northeastern China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East. In India, Asiatic Black Bear range overlaps the Sloth Bear at low elevations (&lt;1,000 m) in some protected areas including Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Parks, Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012). However, there is no evidence of overlap with Sloth Bears in neighbouring Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al. </em>1999). In North Karbi Anglong wildlife sanctuary in Assam, northeast India, Asiatic Black Bear range overlaps both Sloth Bears and Sun Bears—one of the few places in the world where all three of these species coexist, although all are reported to be rare (Choudhury 2011, Choudhury and Chand 2012).</p>","<p>Bear bile has been an important component of traditional medicine in Eastern Asia for millennia. The first written account of such use was recorded in the first pharmacopeia of China in 659 A.D. (Feng <em>et al. </em>2009). Bear bile is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for reducing fever and inflammation, detoxifying the liver, arresting convulsions, improving eyesight, and dissolving gall stones.<br/> <br/> The medicinally active ingredient of bear bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In controlled, clinical trials, this compound (and its associated conjugates) has been shown to have many of the medicinal properties claimed in TCM. In western societies it has been approved as a drug to treat certain liver diseases. More recently it has been shown to prevent retinal degeneration (Boatright <em>et al</em>. 2006), protect against Type I diabetes (Engin <em>et al. 2013</em>), and to have therapeutic effects for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease (Vang <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> Despite the availability of synthesized UDCA, and the widespread use of this product in China, Japan, and South Korea, as well as a large number of herbal alternatives to bear bile in the Chinese pharmacopeia, many TCM practitioners (in Asia and elsewhere) prefer using bear bile because it is thought to be more effective and more natural than synthetic products. Some have claimed that other compounds in bear bile aid in the medicinal functions of UDCA, although no clinical trials have compared the efficacy of bear bile versus synthesized UDCA. Evidence suggests that UDCA in bear bile, which is a potent inhibitor of cell death (apoptosis), may serve to protect bears during hibernation (Solá <em>et al. </em>2006). Asiatic Black Bears produce high levels of UDCA. Historically, the Asiatic Black Bear has been sought after for its bile more than any other bear species. It is sold in various forms including whole gallbladders, raw bile, pills, powders, flakes, and ointments (Foley <em>et</em> <em>al. </em>2011).<br/> <br/> Increased demand, stemming from burgeoning human populations, coupled with more effective hunting of wild bears and increased ability to sell and transport products has led to the over-exploitation of many Asiatic Black Bear populations, especially in China and Southeast Asia. This trade was further fuelled by an increasing use of bear paws in a high-priced soup (having nothing to do with TCM; Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> In the late 1970s, a technique was developed to extract bile from captive bears without killing them. This practice, called bear bile farming (or bear farming), started in Korea, then spread to China in 1984, and later to Vietnam, and most recently to Lao PDR and Myanmar. In Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, bear bile farming is technically illegal. In China, farmed bile is legally sold for use in TCM; it has been argued that this helps to satisfy public demand for bile while reducing the illegal hunting and sale of gall bladders of wild bears.<br/> <br/> Bear farming, though, has raised a number of concerns, both about animal welfare and conservation. In Viet Nam, many small-scale bile farms were stocked by thousands of cubs removed from the wild. The condition in which these bears were kept precluded successful breeding and cub rearing. Moreover, although this practice has been illegal since 1992, with regulations strengthened in 2002, the number of wild-caught farmed bears in Viet Nam continually increased, peaking at over 4,000, but declined by over 70% since the mid-2000s with stricter governmental efforts. In part as a result of the decline in farms in Viet Nam, farming operations sprang up in Lao PDR in 2000, and have been increasing rapidly (~120 bears by 2012; Livingstone and Shepherd 2016). Notably, prices of wild bear bile in Lao increased 180x from pre-farming years (1990s) to 2012, suggesting that the availability of farmed bile was actually enticing more users into the market, some of whom were willing to pay considerably more for the wild product (Livingstone and Shepherd 2016). As there is no evidence of breeding of farmed bears anywhere in Southeast Asia, the farms have a negative impact on wild populations both by taking cubs from the wild and by promoting more demand for products of wild bears.<br/> <br/> In China, it appears that many bear farms now have active breeding programs. It is unknown what degree of restocking occurs with cubs from the wild, but cases are still reported of people being apprehended with over 20 bear cubs apparently destined for a Chinese bear farm. The biggest unknown issue in China is whether the legal supply of bile has indeed reduced the demand for (illegal) wild bile, and hence reduced poaching of bears, or, as in Lao PDR, has stimulated more demand. <br/> <br/> For farming to reduce pressure on wild populations consumers must regard wild and farmed products as similar in quality or value—they must be substitutable (Phelps <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the case of bear bile, interview surveys in both China and Viet Nam show that many consumers regard wild bile as superior to farmed bile, are willing to pay higher prices for it, and are disinclined to use substitutes (Drury <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dutton <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, the widespread availability of farmed bile may draw more people into the market via more prescriptions by TCM doctors and more promotions by the farming industry; some of these new users may be prompted to use wild bile for some illnesses, considering it to be more potent and pure. Farmed bile has also been promoted (via advertising) for non-medicinal uses, such as general well-being (administered in lotions, shampoos, cosmetics, tonics, etc.) or hangovers, although such uses are technically illegal. Because farmed bile is cheap, some people also use it recreationally (Vu 2010).<br/> <br/> Currently there are 67 registered bear farms in China, with an undisclosed number of bears (recently estimated at &gt;17,000). With China’s consent, the World Conservation Congress in 2012 approved an IUCN Recommendation (<a href=""https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/resrecfiles/WCC_2012_REC_139_EN.pdf"">WCC-2012-Rec-139-EN</a><a> Bear farming in Asia, with particular reference to the conservation of wild populations</a>) that (1) halts any increase in the number of farms and bears on farms, and (2) calls for a scientifically independent and peer-reviewed “situation analysis” to assess whether bear farming has a positive or negative effect (or no effect) on wild bear populations (Garshelis and Scotson 2012). Meanwhile, the recommendation adopted by the IUCN calls for the other four bear farming countries to phase out bear farming.<br/> <br/> All international trade in bile from Asiatic Black Bears, including farmed bile, is illegal under CITES. Despite this, a wide and complex network of international bear bile trading exists, which includes China, Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and all of the Asiatic black bear range countries in Southeast Asia (Foley <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Protection of forested habitats would be an important conservation measure for this species. China, Thailand, and Viet Nam have imposed various sorts of logging bans, but with varying effects (Durst <em>et al.</em> 2001). In some cases this has resulted in trees being obtained (often illegally) from neighbouring countries, or in creating plantations which do not provide food resources for bears. However, in 2010 Russia banned the felling of Korean Pine, a key bear food source (I. Seryodkin, Russian Academy of Sciences, pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In most countries, closer government collaboration with local people and communities would help conserve natural forests. Community-managed forests have become increasingly important tools for conservation of large mammals in Asia: they can provide breeding habitat, create corridors that link isolated state managed protected areas, facilitate dispersal, and increase habitat that supports an overall larger number of animals. Community-managed forests in Nepal, for example, have created habitat that now holds breeding populations of one-horned rhinos and tigers (Gurung <em>et al</em>. 2008). These community-managed forests may provide similarly valuable habitat for bears, although this remains unexplored. The value of community-managed forests for bears should be investigated further, and expansion of community forest networks promoted where appropriate. The use of existing community-managed forests by bears should also be monitored, such as through sign surveys or camera trapping.<br/> <br/> The most beneficial conservation measure for Asiatic Black Bears would be to substantially lessen the demand for bear products, and thus reduce hunting and trade. Large scale, multifaceted, long-term campaigns are urgently required to change social norms regarding consumption of bear parts. Such campaigns are especially important in the main consumer nations of China and Viet Nam, and have indeed been initiated in both those countries by NGOs. As a result, public awareness of bear conservation issues has expanded greatly in the past 10 years in China and Vietnam and attitudes and behaviour are starting to change. In 2014 business leaders in China pledged to cease the practice of corporate gifting of wildlife products and committed to setting new trends for others to follow (TRAFFIC 2014).&#160; As of 2011 over 100,000 Vietnamese citizens had pledged to not consume bear bile, and a number of bear farms had closed due mainly to intensified social pressure (ENV 2012).<br/> <br/> The governments of Republic of Korea and Viet Nam are attempting to phase out bear bile farming. Conversely, bear bile farming is on the rise in Lao PDR and Myanmar, stocked by cubs from the wild. Authorities must recognize that these farms have become established due to loopholes in the laws and misreporting of the activities (Livingstone and Shepherd 2016). Meanwhile, China contends that farming must continue or poaching would increase; whereas no solid data are available to evaluate that view, it remains clear that poaching is still the primary threat, and that this will lessen only if the public demand for bile is reduced. Promotion of synthesized UDCA (or a product that includes UDCA as well as other bile compounds) is likely to be the best course for long-term reduction in demand for bear bile.<br/> <br/> The Asiatic Black Bear is protected under both international and national laws, but often these laws are not enforced. The Asiatic Black Bear has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1979. In most range countries Asiatic Black Bears are listed as a protected species. For example, they are protected under Class 2 of China's Wildlife Protection Law (a limited number of permits are issued to kill nuisance animals), and under Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act. In South Korea they are designated as a national monument (No. 329) within the Cultural Properties Protection Law and also as an Endangered Wild Animal. In Japan, this species is listed under the Law for Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which for trade requires certification of legal take; however, gall bladders and paws are exempted.&#160; Throughout Southeast Asia this species is totally protected in every range country, with the exception of Myanmar, where it is classified as “normally protected”, meaning that it may be killed with a special license, although such licenses are rarely issued (Saw Htun, Wildlife Conservation Society, Myanmar, pers. comm., 2014). The Baluchistan subspecies was listed as Critically Endangered in the 1996 IUCN Red List, and is nationally listed as critically endangered in Pakistan and Iran.<br/> <br/> Despite these measures of protection, unabated poaching puts this species at risk across most of its range. Much greater efforts are needed to reduce poaching and snaring pressure, especially where populations are small or fragmented. This can be partly accomplished through anti-poaching patrols, which are typically conducted by trained reserve staff but may also include village volunteers. Such patrols are important for finding and physically removing snares, particularly in Lao PDR and Viet Nam where snaring pressure is intense (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013). Another indispensable function of patrols is to assess and monitor hunting pressure, in order to gauge the effectiveness of conservation interventions. However, the ability of patrols to actually deter poaching and snaring from happening in the first place, while widely assumed, is little supported by empirical data (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2014). Patrolling is particularly difficult in the remote, mountainous environments that serve as key, remnant habitats for this species. Additional approaches are required.<br/> <br/> Poaching could also be reduced by building conservation and co-management partnerships with local communities around parks and reserves, and by supporting community-based conservation in the absence of designated protected areas. Such approaches seek to build trust, raise awareness, provide motivation, support local resource management institutions, use local (as well as outside) knowledge, offer opportunities for action, boost confidence to act, and generate social pressure against poaching—behavioural change is promoted when these conditions converge. Such approaches have been demonstrated to reduce overall poaching pressure (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2014) and increase tolerance for crop-raiding bears (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012), improving the status of local bear populations (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012; Steinmetz, unpublished data). Much more effort should be devoted to enhancing the involvement of local communities as conservation partners in protected areas where bears occur.<br/> <br/> Sport hunting of Asiatic Black Bears is legal only in Japan and Russia. Russia reports a legal harvest of 75-100 bears/year and an estimated illegal take of about 500 bears/year. Sport harvests of black bears in Japan average about 500/year and have been slowly declining since the late 1980s due to diminishing interest in hunting (Oi and Yamazaki 2006). However, a higher number (generally 1,000-2,000) of nuisance black bears are killed annually (using mainly traps) in towns or agricultural areas of Japan.<br/> <br/>The Republic of &#160;Korea has been partially successful in restoring their wild bear population through restocking, initially with captive-born bears, and later with orphaned wild bears from Russia (which are genetically similar to native Korean bears; Kim <em>et al.</em> 2011). These bears are now reproducing. Some Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia and Thailand are also considering reintroducing bears from captivity, in part to augment wild populations, and in part to relieve pressures on captive facilities which cannot sustain the steady influx of confiscated animals.<br/> <br/> Throughout much of the southern portion of the range of this species, efforts to reduce habitat degradation outside PAs and to increase the number and/or area of PAs would be highly beneficial. An increasing number of PAs are being established in China, Russia, India, and a few other countries within the range of Asiatic black bears (Chape <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sathyakumar <em>et al</em>. 2012), mainly to protect other species, but serving as well to increase protection for black bears. Additionally, the recently amended (2003) Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act provides options for new categories of PAs that could be established to form travel corridors between existing PAs.<br/> <br/> More attention is needed on the issue of human-bear conflicts. A few recent studies have examined mitigation methods to reduce conflicts (Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014) and to create risk models to predict where conflicts are most likely to occur (Honda <em>et al.</em> 2009, Takahata <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, solutions to this issue remain largely elusive, because conflicts are in part due to varying food conditions in the wild, and in part to nearby availability of human food sources. Participation of local people in designing solutions and monitoring outcomes will be critical to success. Projects will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human–bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology in an area, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance of some level of crop-raiding and livestock loss are likely to be key to success (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), which is incomplete and now quite outdated, two range countries, Taiwan and India, have developed National Conservation Action Plans for bears (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2012, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). These are the first such conservation action plans for bears in Asia (although other countries have developed less extensive plans that aid conservation, as for example to deal with human-bear conflicts). Both of these country action plans were developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders. The Taiwanese plan concerns only Asiatic Black Bears, since this is the only bear species in the country (and also an endemic subspecies, <em>U. t. formosanus</em>). The Indian plan covers all four species present in that country: Asiatic Black Bears, Sloth Bears, Brown Bears, and Sun Bears. Both plans emphasize the same key themes: reduction in illegal hunting, mitigation of human–bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education.&#160; Both plans stress actions aimed against illegal hunting, including intelligence gathering, incentivized enforcement, community awareness, restriction of guns, and creation of a database to monitor trade. However, the root of the hunting issue is different in the two countries: in India hunters are motivated to sell bear parts, some of which are traded internationally, whereas in Taiwan bears are taken mainly opportunistically or as by-catch from illegal snaring for ungulates, and the parts (including meat) are used or sold locally (Hwang 2003). Other priority actions in the action plans include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries (India), creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Now that the grey squirrel has become established on the continent, it can be expected that it may ultimately spread throughout much of the red squirrel's range. Grey squirrels not only out-compete the smaller red squirrels, but also carry parapox virus, which is highly pathogenic to red squirrels. Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected, and recent (2006) UK studies have shown that 61% of apparently healthy grey squirrels have been exposed to the virus and may be carriers (C. McInnes <em>in litt.</em> 2006). When the virus is present, the grey squirrel can replace the red squirrel 20 times faster than normal replacement rate (Rushton <em>et al.</em> 2006).

No decline in population size has been detected, and there are no known widespread major threats.

It occurs from the coast up in to mountains up to the tree line. It climbs trees, but lives in simple shallow burrows underground. Summer nests are in stumps, fallen trees, sometimes in low hollows. Usually the burrows consist of two big chambers, nest and larder, and small chambers used as a lavatory. These burrows can become up to 9 m in length, and each chipmunk 'owns' one burrow. Complex voice communication is characteristic to the species. It hibernates in winter. Short and long distance migrations have been registered during years with a poor harvest of Siberian pine nuts. It feeds on various seeds, mainly on Siberian pine, but their diet also includes seeds of other coniferous and deciduous trees and herbs. In spring and summer it consumes herb shoots; and sometimes can eat insects and molluscs. From August onward it stores up food for winter, storage mass usually 3-4 kg. It reproduces after leaving hibernation, in April-May. It is diurnal with most activity being in the morning. In Mongolia they do not hibernate during bad weather but do go into torpor, awakening occasionally to feed from their cache. They rarely become pests and if they do they are easy to control.","There are no major threats to this species throughout its range.

This activity is now believed to have ceased and at present the dominant threat to this species is human-caused and natural wildfires in some parts of its range. In Japan, there is suspected hybridization of native <em>T. s. lineatus</em> with feral continental individuals on Hokkaido, especially in urban areas, e.g. Sapporo (Abe, <em>et al.</em>, 2005); this is exacerbated by the importation of squirrels from Korea and the mainland for pet shops.","This species is relatively abundant across its range.

However, these plantations can support multiple individuals if there is adjacent endemic forest as well (Randimbiharinirina <em>et al. </em>2017). The southern spiny desert appears to be the only habitat in which the species does not occur. Its presence in many areas appears to be determined largely by its primary food resource, the seeds of ramy (<em>Canarium </em>spp.) although there are also other dietary staples (Randimbiharinirina <em>et al.</em> 2017). During the day, <em>D. madagascariensis</em> sleeps in nests, tree forks or vine tangles.

Recent evidence suggests that Aye-ayes are not strictly solitary, but also forage in tandem and may exhibit differing relationships between animals of the same sex (Sterling and Richard 1995). Aye-ayes appear to have no restricted mating season (i.e. non-seasonal). A single offspring is born which is nurtured for 18 – 24 months before it is weaned. Females begin breeding at three or four years, and indications are that females give birth every two to three years (Petter and Peyrieras 1970, E. E. Louis, Jr. <em>pers. comm.</em>).</p>","Habitat destruction is the primary threat for aye-aye throughout their range, with trees such as <em>Intsia bijuga</em> and <em>Canarium madagascariensis</em> – dietary staples for the species – being cut preferentially for the construction of boats, houses, and coffins (Iwano and Iwakawa 1988). As this species subsist primarily as signal individuals with enormous home territories, loss of habitat is primary threat.

Whether the species formerly existed on the island of Nosy Mangabe remains uncertain, but subsequent expeditions have confirmed its continued survival there since its mid-1960s after the introduction of nine individuals. This species occurs from sea-level to high mountain elevations. It has been estimated that there will be a 43% reduction in the species' range from 2000 to 2080 due to climate change (Brown and Yoder 2015). This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

Yet despite occurring in a great many protected areas, their presence is often based only on signs and infrequent sightings, so there is little understanding of population size and dynamics until recently (review included citations). However, there is an urgent need for a systematic census of this important flagship species throughout its range, with the ultimate objective of developing a conservation action plan for the species. As of 2019, there were approximately 50 aye-ayes in various zoological collections worldwide (ZIMS 2019). There is a captive breeding programme involving various institutions, and an EEP and a SSP. This species has not successfully bred in second generation in captivity. Furthermore, due to their secretive lifestyle in the forest canopy without being directly observed, any ability to recognize crisis situation involving this species will most likely only noted after they have been extirpated from a location.

It is reported to inhabit all levels of the forest, but is most likely to be found in lianas, thick cover and on terminal branches. It also readily descends to the ground to travel, or to eat fallen fruit or lick earth (Petter <em>e</em><em>t al.</em> 1977). It can even be seen delicately moving through some of the knife-edged karst <em>tsingys</em> that occur within its range, especially in the Ankarana region. The diet consists mainly of fruits (Reuter 2015), supplemented with young leaves, flowers, and pollen; insects and soil are also eaten on occasion. The animals tend to rely heavily on 10–20% of the nearly 100 plant species it exploits, and feeds more on flowers during the dry season than at other times of the year. This species is known to raid farms and plantations. Females have a 34 day reproductive cycle, with the vulva being closed when not in oestrus. In Ankarana<strong> </strong>and Montagne d' Ambre, mating occurs in late May and early June, and births take place from mid-September through October. The gestation period is 125 days (Kappeler 1987). One or two young are born, each weighing approximately 60 grams. Weaning occurs at 6–7 months. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at about 20 months. Home range size is approximately 10–15 ha (Freed 1996). Group size does not appear to differ significantly between habitat types (Gudiel <em>et al.</em> 2017), the average group being five or six and the maximum size about 15 individuals. Large multi-male / multi-female groups often split into foraging subgroups of 2–4 individuals, with solitary individuals sometimes observed.

Habitat loss across the range is due to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, mining for sapphires and gold, and illegal logging. The species is hunted for subsistence consumption and occasionally for the informal bushmeat trade. Hunting for subsistence consumption has been reported in the Antsiranana region (Gilles and Reuter 2014) and from around and within the Ankarana National Park (Reuter 2015, Reuter <em>et al.</em> 2017). Hunting for the bushmeat trade has been reported over several years in Sambava (Conservation International 2010, B. Semel <em>pers. comm.</em> 2018).

Flower parts (likely nectar) are an especially important food item late in the dry season. The very dense hybrid population at Andringitra rely heavily on strangler figs during this period, so the substantially lower densities may be related to low availability of suitable fallback foods. This species has high fission-fusion dynamics and frequently use forest edges, which may enhance its ecological flexibility.&#160; Relatively fast life histories may also contribute to its resilience or resistance to environmental changes, such as in the aftermath of cyclones – however, this flexibility may be compromised by increased fragmentation and climate change (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2011).    </p></span>","<p>                <em>Eulemur cinereiceps</em> has among the most restricted distribution of its genus, with recent analyses of&#160;satellite imagery estimating that total habitat remaining within its range is little more than 700 km<sup>2</sup>. In 1997 a powerful cyclone reduced the coastal population by about 50% (Ratsimbazafy <em>et al. </em>2002). Coastal populations have simultaneously suffered a significant genetic bottleneck (Brenneman <em>et al.</em> 2012). Effective population size (i.e., the number of breeding individuals) falls well below total population estimates. Selective logging, hunting and the continued conversion of rain forest habitat to agricultural land are the greatest threats to the survival of the species. It is trapped easily by hunters during the fruiting season of the strawberry guava (<em>Psidium cattlianum</em>) in Manombo (J. Ratsimbazafy <em>pers. comm.</em>).

The hybrid zone at Andringitra maintains very high densities (58/km<sup>2</sup>; Irwin <em>et al</em>. 2005); however, estimated rates of cross-population migration are low and the hybrid zone appears to be stable, suggesting a relatively low risk of hybridization ‘swamping out’ populations of <em>E. cinereiceps </em>in the interior forests (Delmore <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wyner <em>et al. </em>2002). Cyclone Gretelle apparently reduced coastal populations in 1997 (Ratsimbazafy <em>et al. </em>2002), but densities did not differ from pre-cyclone levels by 2007 (Johnson <em>et al. </em>2011). Total populations for coastal fragments at Agnalazaha (Mahabo) and Manombo were previously estimated at 134 and 605 individuals, respectively (Brenneman <em>et al. </em>2012). Recent reports indicate further declines in these due to hunting (including with firearms) and ongoing habitat degradation and loss (R. Andriamisedra, M. Donohue, <em>pers. obs</em>.). Nearby Ankarabolava-Agnakatrika Forest is also subject to sustained degradation and hunting; however, densities at this small forest are very high and increasing (from 133 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in 2013 to 169 in 2019; C. Birkinshaw, unpub. data). The largest remaining coastal habitat, Manombo Special Reserve and adjacent classified forest, has been reduced at an annual rate of 2.9%, with only 4,480 ha remaining (Donohue <em>et al.</em> 2019). Number of breeding individuals estimated from population genetics is lower for all populations: 13 for Agnalazaha and 30 each for Manombo and the interior, continuous forest of Vevembe (Brenneman <em>et al. </em>2012). Individuals<em>&#160;</em>at coastal forests also demonstrate a higher probability of having undergone a significant population bottleneck within the last 20-500 years (Brenneman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>                This species occurs only in southeastern Madagascar in a thin strip of tropical moist lowland forest (sea level to 900 m) that runs from the Andringitra Massif south to the Mananara River.

Recent analyses of Landsat imagery estimate that total habitat remaining within this species’ range is less than 700 km<sup>2</sup> (Irwin <em>et al. </em>2005). South-east of the Andringitra Massif, there is an up to 70-km wide hybrid zone between <em>E. rufifrons </em>and <em>E. cinereiceps</em>, centred<em> </em>at the headwaters of the Manampatrana (Delmore <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>It has been estimated that there will be a 99% reduction in the species' range from 2000 to 2080 due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015).</p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

The principal threats to its survival are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and logging, and hunting with snares, shotguns, and slingshots. Apparently, it is easily baited and trapped during the fruiting season of the strawberry guava (<em>Psidium cattlianum</em>). On the coast, the species numbers only in the hundreds. The only protected areas in which it occurs are the Manombo Special Reserve and the nearby Agnalazaha Forest, which is now being managed by the Missouri Botanical Garden, as well as the interior corridor COFAV new protected area. Human pressures remain high in protected areas (e.g. 75% of vegetation plots at Manombo include signs of human disturbance; M. Donohue, unpublished data) and <em>E. cinereiceps'&#160;</em>food sources are commonly used for food and construction in local communities (R. Andriamisedra, <em>pers. obs.</em>). Initial searches of other remaining forests in the Farafangana region do not appear to harbour this species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Unfortunately, Manombo and Agnalazaha represent less than 5% of the total remaining habitat within this species' range (Irwin <em>et al. </em>2005). It also occurs in continuous corridor forests west of Vondrozo, which are now part of COFAV (Johnson and Overdorff 1999). This will be critical for the long-term survival of the Grey-headed Lemur, as the vast majority of populations are found within this corridor and few are presently protected. Enhanced protection of the classified forest adjacent to Manombo Special Reserve is a high conservation priority (in progress with the national NGO GERP), as is preservation of the existing, very interesting hybrid zone at Andringitra National Park and surrounding areas. As of 2009, there were approximately a dozen individuals reported in four zoological collections (ISIS 2009), but only one of these (Linton Zoo, UK) is keeping a breeding group (C.

Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include observed, inferred and predicted continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat from slash-and-burn agriculture, illegal logging, mining, the cutting of bamboo, and climate change, and decline in the number of mature individuals through unsustainable levels of hunting. Based on these premises, the species is listed as Critically Endangered. It should be noted that there has been a recent recovery of the number of known individuals in the wild over the past ten years, within a small number of isolated subpopulations that have been the focus of intensive community-based conservation efforts, and the situation is currently therefore not quite as critical as it was a decade ago. Unfortunately the situation facing the species outside of these few recovering subpopulations is suspected to be extremely critical, with many subpopulations likely to have gone extinct in the recent past or to be pushed to extinction in the near future; and even within the recovering subpopulations factors such as climate change, limited genetic diversity and increasing anthropogenic threats are likely to impact the viability of these subpopulations into the future.</p><p></p>","<p>This species is associated with habitats containing large-culmmed bamboo (King <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017), particularly <em>Cathariostachys madagascariensis</em> in mid to high altitude rainforest sites (Tan 1999, 2000; Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2008; Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011; Randrianarimanana <em>et al.</em> 2012; Olson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and <em>Valiha diffusa</em> and <em>Bambusa vulgaris</em> in lowland secondary habitats (Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, Bonaventure <em>et al. </em>2012, Lantovololona <em>et al. </em>2012, Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2012, King <em>et al.</em> 2013a). In Ranomafana National Park, the bamboo <em>Cathariostachys madagascariensis </em>can account for as much as 95% of the diet, with shoots, young and mature leaves, and pith being consumed (Tan 1999, 2000, Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017), a diet containing very high levels of cyanide (Ballhorn <em>et al.</em> 2016). The patchiness of this bamboo species may be one factor limiting the current distribution and population continuity of <em>Prolemur simus</em>, as this key food species is not found in all forest microhabitats, and may be limited to forest near large rivers. The availability of drinking water could also be a limiting factor, as during dry months in Ranomafana National Park, <em>P. simus </em>was the only lemur species seen regularly coming to streams to drink water (Wright <em>et al. </em>2008). The current distribution of the species coincides with regions with the shortest dry seasons, suggesting that prolonged dry seasons may have caused the historical reduction in the species range (Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Observations of wild populations and animals in captivity suggest that this species is cathemeral, active both during the day and at night throughout the year. They live in polygamous groups that can occupy home ranges of 40-60 ha or more &#160;(Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2010, and references therein). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Unusually for lemurs, males are dominant in <em>P. simus</em> groups (Roullet 2012). Males are slightly heavier than females (mean adult weights 2.75 and 2.61 kg respectively at Kianjavato; Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Terrestriality in <em>P. simus</em> is seasonal, being more frequent in the austral summer than the austral winter, peaking in January in Kianjavato (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in February at Ambalafary (Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2018) and in Ranomafana National Park (Tan 2000 cited by Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2018).

Adult female annual mortality at Kianjavato over a four-year period ranged from 0% to 22% (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), with a mean of 7.75%. <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Reproductive females generally give birth annually to a single infant (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), with twins only rarely reported (Randriahaingo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Minimum fecundity rates for reproductive females at Kianjavato over a three year period ranged from 91.7% to 100%, mean 94.0%, although still-born or infant deaths soon after birth may have been overlooked (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Two females of known age had their first infants in their third year at Kianjavato, and males exhibited dispersal behaviour in their third and fourth years (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). In captivity the youngest female to give birth was just under two years old (1 year 11 months 7 days; Roullet 2012), and the youngest male at conception was 2.7 years old (2 years 8 months 6 days; Roullet 2012). Gestation length at Kianjavato was observed to be 149 days for one female, and 148 to 150 days for another female (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Timing of births is highly seasonal. At Kianjavato, 88% of births were estimated to occur during an eight-week period in September and October, including 47% within a two-week period from mid- to late-September. The average birthdate of infants to multiparous females was the 28 September at Kianjavato, 99 days after the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere of 21 June (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), significantly earlier than the 138 days after the winter solstice reported from the higher-elevation site of Ranomafana National Park (Tan 2000 cited by Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015; most births in October and November). Most successful copulations at Kianjavato were calculated to occur in late April and early May (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), and at Ranomafana in May and June (Mutschler and Tan 2003). Interbirth intervals of wild <em>P. simus</em> at Kianjavato were found to be one year (12.1 months following a surviving infant and 11.5 months if the infant died, although the difference was not statistically significant; Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). The age of weaning during the same study was roughly estimated at 7 months after birth (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), and in captivity at 8.5-10 months (Roullet 2012). Infant mortality in wild <em>P. simus</em> at Kianjavato over a three-year period ranged from 40.0% to 54.5% per year, with a mean of 46.7% (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015).

In particular, this species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p><em>Prolemur simus</em> was one of the most abundant lemurs in sub-fossil times with a large geographic range and a highest historical population estimated at about one million individuals between approximately 60,000 and 90,000 years ago (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018). This was followed by two major population declines, the first due to climatic change, the second probably due to anthropogenic factors (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018). By 2007 the known number of <em>P. simus</em> in the wild was less than 100, spread across 11 localities (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008) within what could be described as five distinct and isolated subpopulations (Torotorofotsy, Ranomafana National Park, Kianjavato, Andringitra National Park, and Karianga-Ivato). Targeted surveys organized from 2008 to 2010 as the first phase of The Aspinall Foundation’s “Saving <em>Prolemur simus</em>” project in collaboration with various partners including Association Mitsinjo, GERP and Conservation International, led to an extension to the known range of the species and the discovery of over twenty previously unknown localities (Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011) in seven subpopulations (Zahamena National Park, western Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor, Andriantantely, Vohiposa, Mahalina, Nosivolo-Marolambo, Midongy-Vondrozo). Around the same time an additional subpopulation was discovered to the east of Ranomafana National Park. However, despite the discovery of these previously unknown subpopulations, numbers of individuals were very low at each site, and in early 2010 the total known number of <em>P. simus</em> in the wild was estimated at between 230 and 320, and in 2011 at about 420. By 2015 the known number of <em>P. simus</em> in the wild had risen to just over 1,000 individuals (Helpsimus 2015), with one subpopulation numbering over 250 individuals (Andriantantely with 281 reported <em>P. simus</em>), another with over 200 individuals (Vohitrarivo-Tsaratanana with 229), three with 100-150 individuals (CAZ west-Torotorofotsy, Vohiposa and Kianjavato), and five others with reported numbers of less than 100. A few additional sites were reported to have possible subpopulations based on indirect evidence. The two largest subpopulations have continued to increase and by 2018 were reported to comprise between 400 and 500 individuals each, and approaching 250 mature individuals in each. </p><p>                      </p><p>Between 2010 and 2018 mean population growth of <em>P. simus</em> groups within the Andriantantely subpopulation benefiting from the initiation of community-based protection was 22% per year (H.N.T.

This growth rate appears to be slowing from initially higher rates of 26% to 29% during the first few years, probably due to the protected groups approaching the carrying capacity of the available habitat. Similarly at Kianjavato, following several years of conservation activities (and therefore probably of population growth), growth rates over a 3-year period varied from -1% to 17% at a mean of 7.3% (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>                  </p><p>                    </p><p>Subfossil remains confirm that <em>Prolemur simus </em>once had a widespread distribution in Madagascar that covered the northern, north-western, central and eastern portions of the country, including Ampasambazimba in the Itasy Basin (west of Antananarivo), the Grotte d'Andrafiabe on the Ankarana Massif, and the Grottes d'Anjohibe near Mahajanga and Tsingy de Bemaraha (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018). By the late 1800s the species' range was restricted to the eastern rainforests, with collecting records from ca. 1870 to 1913 recording it from the Bay of Antongil in the north-east to Nandihizana in the south-east (Godfrey and Vuillaume-Randriamanantena 1986, Schwarz 1931). In the mid-1900s some authors believed that the species may have become extinct (Napier and Napier 1967), until it was rediscovered in the south-east in the 1960s and 70s (Meier and Rumpler 1987, Petter <em>et al.</em> 1977). Until recently these south-eastern populations were thought to be the last remaining of the species (Mutschler and Tan 2003). Recent range extensions based on confirmed sightings illustrate that the present-day range is not as diminished as previously thought (Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2008, King and Chamberlan 2010, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, King <em>et al.</em> 2013a), and indirect evidence suggests the species may still be widely distributed through much of eastern Madagascar (Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2010, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013, 2017, King <em>et al. </em>2013a). The latitudinal range of sites with confirmed sightings as of May 2018 is 18°06’S (near Didy in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor; The Aspinall Foundation, unpubl. data) to 22°26’S (near Karianga, north of Vondrozo; Johnson and Wyner 2000, Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008).

Collaborative community-based surveys undertaken in 2009 and 2010 by The Aspinall Foundation, Association Mitsinjo, GERP Conservation International and others led to the discovery of several previously unknown populations and significant extensions to the known range of the species (King and Chamberlan 2010, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013). Building on the ongoing <em>P. simus</em> conservation work initiated in and around Torotorofotsy by Association Mitsinjo (Dolch <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, 2015), community-based conservation activities were immediately initiated at many of the newly discovered sites by The Aspinall Foundation with various partners, especially in the northern (Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor, Andriantantely and surrounding areas; Ravaloharimanitra and King 2012; Chamberlan <em>et al.</em> 2013; King <em>et al.</em> 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2013a, 2013b, 2015) and central (Nosivolo; Andrianandrasana <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rakotonirina and Chamberlan 2014) parts of the known range. Further south, similar site-based <em>P. simus</em> conservation projects were also being developed, including at Kianjavato by the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo (Manjaribe <em>et al.</em> 2013; Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), at Vohitrarivo-Tsaratanana by Helpsimus and partners (Rakotoarinivo <em>et al.</em> 2017a, 2017b), and at Ivato-Mahasoa by MICET/ICTE (P. Wright, <em>pers. comm.</em>), in addition to the long-term research and conservation activities in the Ranomafana National Park (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008, Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017). The combined efforts of these projects led to the recovery of the known population of <em>P. simus</em> from about 100 to over 1,000 individuals in just under a decade. Whilst this is a remarkable collaborative conservation achievement, based primarily on community-based conservation, the situation of the species remains very fragile and dependent on the continued commitment of this small number of organisations to its survival; indeed over half the known population is protected by community-based projects facilitated by just one organisation (The Aspinall Foundation), roughly a third by one other (Helpsimus), and the rest by a small number of organisations including MBP/Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo, Association Mitsinjo, Conservation International, MICET/ICTE and Madagascar National Parks. Apart from the known groups protected and monitored by these projects, populations or groups elsewhere are likely to be continuing to decline due to habitat loss (Morelli <em>et al.</em> 2019) and hunting, and even where they are protected the effects of climate change are predicted to have negative implications for the suitability of the habitats they currently occur in (Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>  <p><em>Prolemur simus</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Papyrus and reeds seems to be the staple food source. <em>Hapalemur alaotrensis </em>is a cathemeral species, although nocturnal activity levels are reduced. They live in family groups of up to a dozen members and defend territories ranging in size from less than one hectare to eight hectares. Young are born from September through February and twins are common (Mittermeier et al. 2008, and references therein).","Conversion of marsh habitat to rice fields has been the most severe threat to the survival of this species, although the remaining marsh habitats are difficult to convert due to regular flooding. However, a major drainage project would pose a major threat if this were realized in the region. Burning of the remaining marshlands takes place to catch fish and to graze cattle. The resulting increase in aquatic plants is choking fishing areas and driving further burning and may also limit marsh regeneration after flooding. <br/><br/>Hunting for food and capture for pets (Reuter and Schaefer 2017) also have reduced its numbers through the years. Local people employ a variety of hunting and trapping methods. Direct pursuit by dogs is the most common, but they may also be captured by using a harpoon, a snare, a stick to knock them out or into the water, or by burning their reed bed habitat, causing them to flee into the hands of waiting hunters. More than 1,000 lemurs have been hunted annually in some years (Mutschler <em>et al.</em> 2001).","Populations are inferred to have undergone a population decline of ≥80% over a period of 27 years (three generations), due primarily to continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, in addition to exploitation through unsustainable hunting pressure.<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;These causes have not ceased, and will to a large extent not be easily reversible.<br/><em><br/></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>Hapalemur alaotrensis </em>is a small folivorous primate that lives in family groups of 2 to 9 individuals occupying territories of 1 to 2ha.

This time period includes some time in both the past and the future. Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, severe forest fragmentation, and exploitation through unsustainable levels of hunting and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade.&#160;Based on these premises, the species is listed as Endangered, though it will likely be considered Critically Endangered in the near future.</p><p></p>","<p>The Ring-tailed Lemur’s marked ecological flexibility allows this species to colonize a diverse range of habitats in southern, south-west, and south-central Madagascar including gallery, littoral, and dry deciduous forests, spiny bush, brush and scrub, high-altitude ericoid bush and rocky outcrop vegetation (Sauther <em>et al.</em> 1999, Goodman<em> et al. </em>2006, Gould 2006, Cameron and Gould 2013, Gould and Gabriel 2014, LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2014, LaFleur and Sauther 2015). Indeed, at the upper portion of its elevation range on Andringitra, the species occurs in a zone above the forest line and in a vast expanse of vertical rock, with up to 400-m tall talwegs, surrounded by ericoid savanna. It encounters the most extreme climatic conditions on the island from the hottest and driest (Tsimanampesotse) to the coldest (Andringitra Massif). It has a varied diet, and does not seem to be constrained by available water sources (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2006), although when available does drink water daily (LaFleur, <em>per obs.</em>). Ring-tailed Lemurs are cathemeral and can be active at any time of the day or night, although they seem to avoid night time activity when overnight temperatures are low (Donati <em>et al.</em> 2013, LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2014). This is the best-studied of Madagascar's lemurs; its biology and ecology have been summarized most recently by Jolly <em>et al.</em> (2006), Gould (2006), Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (2008), Gould <em>et al.</em> (2011), Gould and Gabriel (2014), and Fardi <em>et al.</em> (2018). </p>","<p>Habitat loss, hunting, and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade are the greatest causes of concern. The Ring-tailed Lemur has a strong preference for gallery forests for <em>Euphorbia</em> bush, and rocky outcrop rupicolous forest, but these habitats are already restricted in southern and south-central Madagascar and continue to diminish due to annual burning practices that help create new pasture for livestock. Subsequent over-grazing and harvesting of <em>Euphorbia</em> for livestock, and the felling of trees for charcoal production further impact wild populations. This species is also hunted for food in certain areas and frequently wild-captured and kept as a pet.<br/><br/>Furthermore, due to more frequent droughts in the southern regions compared with past decades, this species is increasingly threatened. Hannah&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008) predicted that a mean temperature increase of 2.6°C will occur in southern Madagascar in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and that arid regions in southern Madagascar will become further desiccated, which will have important and largely negative biological consequences for flora and fauna inhabiting this geographic area. Cyclones, severe storms and flooding also affect this species (see LaFleur and Gould 2009). Moreover, range shift predictions based climatic models for Madagascar suggest that ring-tailed lemurs will experience a net loss of 63% of available habitat simply due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015). </p>","<p>The population of this species is suspected to be undergoing decline, with individuals are now largely restricted to completely isolated or relatively isolated fragments throughout their geographic range, and overall population densities have been noted as low (Sussman <em>et al</em>. 2003, Gould and Sauther 2016). There is a suspected population reduction of ≥50% in this species over a three-generation period (36 years, estimating the generation length to be 12 years). This time period includes some time in both the past and the future. Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include a continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, severe forest fragmentation, and exploitation through unsustainable levels of hunting and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade.</p><p>There are only eight remaining known populations that have more than 100 individual Ring-tailed Lemurs (LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2018). These are: 1) Amoron’i Onilahy Protected Area, 2) Andringitra National Park, 3) Anja Community Reserve, 4) Berenty Private Reserve (and surrounding forest fragments), 5) Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (Parcels one and two), 6) Isalo National Park, 7) the “Lost Forest” (Ihorombe Region of the Ihosy District), and 8) Tsimanampesotse National Park. Some of these populations are well-protected and unlikely to be extirpated (e.g. Berenty Private Reserve, Anja Community Reserve), or are relatively safe from localized extinction because of the difficult nature of the landscape (i.e. Andringitra National Park). However, other locations are subject to pressure from hunting (i.e. Amoron’I Onilahy), and live-capture for the within country pet trade (i.e. Tsimanampesotse). Fire also presents a risk to Ring-tailed Lemurs (e.g. Isalo, Tsaranoro Valley, and Lost Forest), as does the loss of genetic diversity resulting from population isolation. This species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p><br/>The following lists population counts and/or densities at sites where ring-tailed lemur populations have recently been counted. These sites represent only a fraction of the geographic range, yet give a ‘snapshot’ of the status of some of Ring-tailed Lemur populations in 2018 and illustrate that the overall population of this lemur is low, and that most populations occur in small fragmented forests (see Gould and Sauther 2016, LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Berenty Reserve, the population density is 2.5 individuals/ha in the gallery forest, 5.0 individuals/ha at the tourist front, and 1.3 individuals/ha in the scrub and spiny forest (Jolly <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2006, Koyama <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pride 2005, Gould <em>et al.</em> 2011).

In 2006, 225 individuals were counted in a 980 ha area (Sauther and Cuozzo 2008).<br/><br/>On the western edge of Andringitra National Park, WWF guides estimated in 2009 that ~100 lemurs may range in a large area of the park, and 12 were counted at the summit of the Diavolana circuit.<br/><br/>A 2013 census at the 34 ha Anja Community Reserve revealed a total of 210 animals and a population density of 6.2 individuals/ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In Tsaranoro forest, the population density in 2013 was 1.47 individuals/ha, with a total of 78 animals in 53 ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In Andranobe community reserve, population density in 2013 was 1.7 individuals/ha. with a total of 30 individuals in 17.4 ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In the 20.3 ha Samisorany community reserve, 21 animals were noted in 2013 with a density of 1.03/ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>The <em>Lemur catta</em> population at the 7.7 ha Sakaviro community reserve, was 30 individuals in 2013 (density= 1.03/ha) (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>Five additional populations of <em>L. catta </em>were counted in small forest fragments in the south-central region (250 sq km area), with populations ranging from 6-28 animals, and densities of 0.28 to 5.3/ha. Two of these fragments were seriously compromised by tree cutting and firewood extraction, and the <em>L. catta</em> populations within were considered at serious risk of extirpation (Gould and Sauther 2016).<br/><br/>In the Ambatotsirongorongo fragment, the population density is 1.5 individuals/ha. In 2010, approximately 50 individuals in a 30 ha area were counted (Razafindramanana 2011).<br/><br/>In the Petriky fragment, the population density is 0.004 individuals/ha.

The north-western boundary may be Toliara, although this is currently unknown. Populations north of Toliara and west of Isalo may have been locally extirpated, or have at least become extraordinarily rare due to intensive and prolonged bushmeat hunting (see Goodman <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Moniac and Heitmann 2007, Siers 2007, Gardner and Davies 2014). The south-eastern limit ends at the divide between the western and eastern watersheds, which is aligned with the division between western dry and eastern humid vegetation types. All records from the Andohahela National Park are from the extreme western portion, at the ecotone between dry and humid forests. Intensive hunting has taken place here and threatens any remaining individuals or populations of ring-tailed lemurs. The currently known north-eastern limit is Sakaviro Community Reserve, 9 km north-west of the town of Ambalavao. A population also occurs at altitudes up to 2,600 m in the mountains of Andringitra on the south-eastern plateau (Goodman and Langrand 1996, Yoder <em>et al</em>. 1999). A newly discovered population inhabits the humid rainforest, or “Lost Forest”, of the Ihosy District (Ihorombe Region, Wright and Buono, pers comm).

Based on these premises, <em>M. murinus </em>is listed as Least Concern. Further information on hybridization, population status, habitat loss, and threats may warrant listing this species in a more threatened category in the future.</p>","<em>Microcebus murinus</em> inhabits lowland tropical dry forest, sub-arid thorn scrub, gallery forest, spiny forest and secondary forest formations. They are also present in plantations and degraded habitats (Ganzhorn and Schmid 1998). Studies at Ampijoroa also indicate that individuals may take shelter in three to nine different tree holes within their range and remain in a given shelter for several days in succession. Females tend to share nests with several conspecifics, while males tend to sleep alone (Radespiel <em>et al.</em> 1998). The sexes also differ in home ranges, as male home ranges tend to be larger, especially during the mating season (Buesching <em>et al</em>. 1998, Radespiel 2000, Eberle and Kappeler 2002).&#160;After a gestation of approximately 60 days, typically two young are born.","In the west of the range, habitat is being lost due to yearly burning for slash-and-burn and cattle grazing. Although <em>Microcebus murinus</em> is reported to inhabit secondary forests  and degraded habitats, there is some evidence that decreased habitat  quality may have adverse effects on population dynamics. According to  Ganzhorn and Schmid (1998), fewer large tree holes in secondary forests  result in fewer opportunities to save energy through periods of torpor,  and may increase levels of stress and mortality. Live capture to supply the local pet trade is also a threat to this species, especially in the southern and northern parts of its range. Mining also poses a threat to this species.

The diet is seasonally variable but consists mainly of young and mature leaves, fruits and seeds, supplemented with bark, dead wood, and termite soil (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein), and invertebrates (R.J. Lewis, unpublished data). <em>Propithecus verreauxi</em> tends to live in small to medium, single and multi-male, groups that range from 2-14 (average five to six individuals), with home ranges varying from 4-20 ha depending on habitat. Breeding is seasonal, with mating taking place in January through to early March. Infants are almost completely independent at six months (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein). The age of first reproduction is typically 5 or 6 years but can occur as early as 3 years. A single offspring is born in June to September after a gestation of 162–170 days (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein).&#160;</p>","<p>Despite its wide distribution, the two principal habitats upon which this species depends for survival (spiny forest and riparian or gallery forest), are under continual threat because of logging, slash-and-burn agriculture (habitat loss has increased dramatically since 2009 where the loss at Menabe-Antimena was estimated at only 4.1%; however, as of 2017, the loss had increased to 29.7% due to immigration and agricultural shifts to corn followed by peanuts) and charcoal and fuelwood production. The habitat in southern Madagascar has been altered with the introduction of&#160;<em>Opuntia</em>&#160;prickly pear cactus in the 1700s .Fires due to deliberate burning to create savanna for feeding cattle, as well as accidental burning due to the dry nature of the forest are also a major cause of habitat loss in some areas especially the long-term drought in southwestern and western Madagascar. The boat-making industry in the southern Menabe region is a source of substantial selective logging of food and sleep site resources. Although hunting is both illegal as well as <em>fady</em> (taboo) to several of the tribes living within its range (e.g., Antandroy, Mahafaly); it is nevertheless hunted for food by other tribes (e.g., Sakalava) and by immigrants to the region. In the Isalo region, this lemur is known as “<em>sifaka-bilany</em>” (“sifaka of the cooking pot”), but it is unclear whether this is because of its popularity as a food item or because of the sooty black appearance of individuals from this part of the species’ range. Populations are also genetically impoverished in terms of heterozygosity in some areas (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein).</p>","<p>Overall population numbers are in decline due to habitat destruction.

In general, densities are lower in areas of degraded habitat which includes protected and nonprotected areas, but even very small forest patches can support sizeable numbers of this species. Reported estimates include 41 individuals/km² in Kirindy Mitea National Park, 150–200/km² at Berenty, and 400–500/km² at Antserananomby.</p><p>Furthermore, although this range including the EOO would be normally considered quite large, the spiny forest habitat in south-western Madagascar has become severely fragmented, decreasing in area by 28% from 1950 to 2000 and undergoing the highest annual rate of deforestation (1.2%) during the 1990’s than any other forest type or region in Madagascar (Harper <em>et al.</em> 2007). This trend has persisted between 2000 to present, continuing the decline in area, extent and quality of habitat. Moreover, the primary threat to <em>Propithecus verreauxi </em>and other regionally endemic biodiversity in the Menabe-Antimena and other regions in western Madagascar is habitat loss to agricultural shift to corn and then peanuts before the land is abandoned. Between 2000 and 2009, deforestation was around 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) per year; by 2014, it was 4,000 hectares per year. By 2017, it is estimated that 29.7 percent was lost. Because 2017 and 2018 were catastrophic with a record number of fires, it is now predicted that the loss could be as high as 44.9 percent in 2020 and 83.1 percent by 2025 (Filou 2019).&#160;</p><p>Furthermore, the habitat in southern Madagascar has been altered with the introduction of <em>Opuntia</em> prickly pear cactus in the 1700s. With its current use as a cheap, quick growing, and readily available option as a living fence, the spiny forest is cleared for cassava and corn which the productivity of the land is short term. Large international mining concessions in southern Madagascar and the subsequent immigration from other ethnic groups into the region have also driven the deterioration of the regional cultural taboos or <em>fady </em>which further threatens this species’ long term survivability.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Verreaux’s Sifaka is distributed in southern, south-western and western Madagascar. The Tsiribihina River is considered the northern limit of the range in the west. The south-eastern extent is formed by the western slope of the Anosy mountain range which has its boundary formed by the Andohahela National Park and World Heritage Site transitional forest parcel of Tsimelahy and the spiny forest parcels of Ihazofotsy and Mangatsiaka. There is also a private reserve, Nahampoana, east of the Andohahela National Park parcels and just north of) Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) which has a small population of Verreaux’s Sifaka; however, this population was probably introduced there as it is not a part of its historical range.

In summary, the regional distribution of the Verreaux’s sifaka extends from the Tsiribihina River south through Menabe-Antimena Protected Area, across the Morondava River to Kirindy Mitea National Park between the Kambatomena and Mangoky Rivers, extending southward from the region north of the Onilahy River which includes the Makay Mountain Protected Area and the Zombitse-Vohibasia and Isalo National Parks, then courses through the Beza-Mahafaly Protected area, Tsimanampetsotse National Park, Mahafaly Plateau Protected area and eastward to Mandrare Valley Protected area, Berenty Reserve and Andohahela National Park.

It is suspected that, in the past, the population declined by 80% (over a three generation period of 30 years) due to habitat loss and degradation and human population growth. An estimated 200,000 individuals were thought to remain as of Mittermeier&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010; however, severe fragmentation and loss of habitat in the protected areas of Ankarafantsika National Park, Anjiamangirana and Bora represents a significant shift over the past thirty years.

The species visits many food patches and its diet is composed of young leaves, mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits and a great quantity of flowers (Honess <em>et al</em>. 2012). The diet is seasonal, with young leaves and flowers dominating the diet in the wet season in Antrema, and mature leaves and any available young leaves providing the staple food source in the dry season (Pichon <em>et al.</em> 2010). Fruit accounts for 6-9% of the diet, the higher figure being recorded in the dry season (Pichon <em>et al.</em> 2010). Fruit consumption increases for up to 28% of the diet during the rainy season (Rakotondrabe <em>et al.</em> 2017).

Many forest fragments have been completely lost in recent memory, and even in some remaining small fragments <em>P. coronatus</em> has been driven to local extinction (Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014).

Field surveys organized to resolve this confusion were undertaken in 2010 and 2011 in order to better inform conservation decision-making for the species (The Aspinall Foundation 2009, King <em>et al. </em>2012), and showed that the distribution of <em>P. coronatus</em> was limited to forest patches in the area between the Mahavavy and Betsiboka Rivers in the north of its range, and between the Manambola, Tsibirhina (east of 45°E), Mania and Sakay Rivers in the extreme south of its range (Razafindramanana and Rasamimanana 2010, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014, King <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is only one reported record east of the Ikopa River (of an extirpated population in the Ambohitantely Special Reserve), but this is considered to have arisen from an error in translation (S. Goodman in Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014), so the species distribution in the central part of the range should be considered to be between the Mahavavy and Ikopa Rivers rather than between the Mahavavy and Betsiboka Rivers as further north (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Melanistic sifaka occur in some populations of typically-coloured <em>P. coronatus</em> in the extreme south of the species range (Paulian 1953, cited by Petter and Peyrieras 1972, Razafindramanana and Rasamimanana 2010, King <em>et al.</em> 2014), possibly resulting from historic gene-flow with <em>P. deckenii</em> for <em>P. coronatus</em> populations located between the Manombolo and Tsibirhina Rivers, or with <em>P. verreauxi</em> for the most southerly known population located between the Mahajilo and Mania Rivers (King <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014). <em>P. coronatus</em> populations have been reported to occur from sea-level to almost 1,100m elevation (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Forest cover within the geographic range of <em>P. coronatus</em> is very fragmented, and is estimated at between 1,600 and 2,850 km² (King <em>et al.</em> 2014; based on a refined interpretation of the forest cover estimates provided by Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;&#160;&#160; </p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

Previous reports of its occurrence in two special reserves (Ambohijanahary and Kasijy) are considered erroneous (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014, King <em>et al.</em> 2014). The new protected area (NAP) of Antrema manages and protects the coastal forests neighboring Katsepy, since 2000 (Ancient RFUM), where <em>Propithecus coronatus</em> benefits from a strong traditional protection (<em>Fady</em>). Approximately two-thirds of the species range within protected areas occurs in the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetland Complex (Andriamasimanana and Cameron 2014), a new protected area promoted by Asity Madagascar. </p>  <p>There is a European captive breeding programme, with very few founders, but apparently showing some success (C.

Roullet <em>pers. comm.</em> 2019). &#160;Increased captive management of this species in Madagascar is recommended (C. Schwitzer <em>pers. comm.</em>); a properly established sifaka population would also be valuable for other future sifaka in captivity for <em>ex situ </em>conservation.<br/> <br/> South of these three new protected areas, several of the formerly unprotected forest fragments supporting the species identified recently by Razafindramanana and Rasamimanana (2010), King <em>et al.</em> (2012, 2014) and Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) are now the focus of community-based conservation projects run by The Aspinall Foundation (Anaboazo-Mangidirano, Kamotro-Liolava and Komadio-Ikay) or by Sifaka Conservation (Mahajeby, Ankirihitra-Mariarano, Dabolava and Mangabe-Mandrava forests). Several of these forests are now under the process of New Protected Area creation. The Sifaka Conservation project aims to establish a metapopulation management strategy to the conservation of the small and fragmented crowned sifaka populations and their habitats in Madagascar (Razafindramanana and Roullet 2011).&#160; The European captive population is included in this programme to ensure its long-term viability as a reserve population for possible future reintroduction (Roullet 2014), but also as a model for the wild populations. This is a multidisciplinary strategy that involves many partners including members of EAZA and the EEP (MEF/GERP/TAF 2011).&#160; </p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

There have been various confusing descriptions of the precise geographic range of <em>P. deckenii</em> in the past, which have been recently summarized by Thalmann <em>et al.</em> (2002), Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) and King <em>et al.</em> (2014).

Previous occasional reports of <em>P. deckenii</em> individuals just outside this range (i.e. east of the Mahavavy River or south of the Manambolo River) amongst otherwise <em>P. coronatus</em> populations (Tattersall 1982, 1988, Thalmann and Rakotoarison 1994) can probably be explained by rare and localized events of <em>P. deckenii</em> individuals crossing rivers or other biogeographical barriers by natural or human-induced methods such as releases or escapes of pet sifaka captured elsewhere (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014), and certainly do not represent the existence of established <em>P. deckenii</em> populations outside the range described above. </p>  <p>Melanistic forms of <em>P. deckenii</em> occur in several populations close to the Mahavavy River (see map in King <em>et al.</em> 2014). These forms vary from light forms with pale heads and only limited patches of dark colouration, through intermediate forms with darker heads and pelage coloration similar to that of typical <em>P. coronatus</em> to very dark forms which are very dark brown on large areas of the head, back, arms and legs, and which are unlike any typical sifaka species (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Towards the source of the Mahavavy River, in the south-east of the <em>P. deckenii</em> range, 20% of individuals of the <em>P. deckenii</em> populations surveyed in and around the Ambohijanahary Special Reserve by Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) exhibited varying degrees of intermediate to dark melanism, and Petter and Peyrieras (1972) reported 17% were melanistic in the same general area.&#160; In the north-east of the species range, Curtis <em>et al.</em> (1998) reported that 25% of individuals of the <em>P. deckenii</em> population at the single site of Analabe within what is now the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetland Complex (MKWC) were melanistic, and similarly Thalmann <em>et al.</em> (2002) reported melanistic individuals made up 25% of the sifaka population at the nearby Anktotrakotraka site. Other surveyed forest fragments within the MKWC consist only of typical white individuals (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 1998, Thalmann <em>et al.</em> 2002). Melanistic individuals have also been reported from Kasijy Special Reserve; located approximately half-way between Ambohijanahary and MKWC, but appear to be few in number (Randrianarisoa <em>et al.</em> 2001). Melanistic infants have so far only been observed with melanistic adults, whilst typical white infants have been observed with both typical and melanistic adults (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given that all localities where <em>P. deckenii</em> populations exhibit melanistic tendencies are close to the eastern limit of the species range, and therefore close to the range of <em>P. coronatus</em>, it is plausible that the underlying cause of the melanism is occasional gene flow with <em>P. coronatus</em>, however other hypotheses have been suggested and further work is clearly required (King <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014; Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;</p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

In the rainy season (November-April) ripe fruit and/or seeds can contribute more than 80% of the diet; in the lean season (May-October) this drops to about 20% and the majority of the diet is composed of leaves and/or flowers (Irwin 2008b; Irwin <em>et al.,</em> 2015; Kerker Oliver 2017; Powzyk 1997).

A single young is born between May and July, after a gestation of 179 days.&#160;Individuals may live up to 25 years in the wild. This species is diurnal and arboreal. In one study, these animals spent 54.5% of their time resting, 32.3% feeding, 5.7% moving, and 5.0% in social behaviour. This species has only twice been studied for a significant period of time (by Powzyk at Mantadia and Irwin at Tsinjoarivo). It lives in female-dominated, multi-male/multi -female groups of 2 to 8 individuals, consisting of 1–3 adult females and 1 or 2 adult males, and multiple females may breed within the same group. Home ranges of 20–80 ha are defended by means of scent-marking, although there is little home range overlap and little aggression over boundaries. Compared to the sympatric, similar -sized <em>Indri indri</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, <em>P. diadema </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">spends more time actively patrolling and defending its territories. The mean daily path length of 987– 1629 m for <em>P. diadema </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">can be compared to 774 m for <em>I. indri </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">(Powzyk 1997). As one of the largest lemurs, it is likely that their only natural predator is the fosa (<em>Cryptoprocta ferox</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">), though it is possible that some large raptors may pose a risk, especially for younger animals. Predation by fosa may be an important threat to this species, especially in fragmented or degraded areas where other prey species may be reduced (Irwin<em> et al. </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">2009). Males emigrate at roughly age five, often to a neighbouring group while females may either emigrate or remain in their natal group; most animals breed after five years of age but occasionally females that stay in their natal group have given birth at 4 years old (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> 2010 and references therein; Irwin unpublished data).</span></span></span></span></p><p></p>","<p>                  </p><p>Continued destruction of rainforest habitat in eastern Madagascar due to slash-and-burn agricultural practices and timber extraction is the principal threat to this sifaka’s survival.

Reports of hunting have increased dramatically since the last assessment, particularly in regions surrounding Andasibe and the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena, as well as northern parts of the species range. Furthermore, illegal rum production, necessitating the planting of sugar cane fields and destructive utilization of sifaka food trees, is a threat to populations in Tsinjoarivo (Irwin and Ravelomanantsoa 2004). The species is occasionally kept as a pet within Madagascar (Reuter and Schaefer 2017).

This decline is due to a combination of factors: a continuation of accelerated annual rates of forest loss throughout the species’ range, studies that demonstrate the unsuitability of remaining forest habitat for this species, and an ongoing, unregulated pet trade of significant proportion.","This species occurs in humid forest in the south to dry deciduous forest in the north; recorded from primary and secondary forests. Known at altitudes up to 400 m, but could occur in higher elevations (to 1,500 m) in the upper valley of the Río Sinu (Defler 2004).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus</em> and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) does not provide for gouging, and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8. <em>Saguinus oedipus</em> lives in groups of 2-9. Neyman (1977, 1979) observed groups of 3-13, Savage <em>et al. </em>(1996a,b) observed reproductively active groups that ranged in size from 3-6 and Gonzalez (2014) observed groups 1- 9. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. <br/><br/>Size:<br/>Tamarins are monomorphic (exhibiting only minor differences in body and canine size). <br/>Adults H&amp;B: 20.8-25.9 cmTotal length: 33.0-41.0 cm (Hershkovitz 1977)Weight: 416.5 g (n = 10) (Savage 1990).","The principal threats to the survival of <em>Saguinus oedipus </em>are an ongoing and apparently accelerating loss of suitable habitat and continuing live capture for the pet trade. According to the most recent data provided by Global Forest Watch, the annual loss of forest cover in all five Colombian departments in which this species is found (Antioquia, Atlantico, Bolivar, Cordoba and Sucre) has increased dramatically over the last three years, doubling and even tripling the rate for the previous three years. Should future generations of cotton-top tamarins suffer from continued loss of suitable habitat at the current rate (not accounting for any additional increase, which is certainly possible), projected gross forest cover loss throughout the species range could be as high as 30%&#160; in the next 18 years (three generations).&#160; However, ground-truth studies in protected and unprotected forests (classified as having the same density of forest cover) indicate the absence of large trees essential for sustaining cotton-top tamarins in the latter, estimates of gross forest cover loss will significantly underestimate the amount of suitable habitat available to this species (A. Savage, unpublished data).&#160; In addition, population losses due to live capture for the pet trade are difficult to quantify, yet the threat remains significant based on continued and documented confiscations by conservation organizations (R.

Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs maintain large home ranges (e.g. 87.8 – 90.5 ha; Baden 2011) consisting of low-to-mid elevation primary forest with tall trees with broad crowns. They are almost exclusively frugivorous; as they are very selective feeders, they are especially susceptible to disturbance (e.g. see White <em>et al. </em>1995, Ratsimbazafy 2002, Seaman <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Vatovavy and Sangasanga, <em>Varecia</em> favour areas far from the forest edge, and areas with a large basal area of known food species. However, preferences did not result in total avoidance areas within fragments; they were ubiquitous across limited forests available (Note: this landscape is at lower elevation than RNP (100-600 m above sea level). See Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2008 and references therein.</a></p>  <p>Group size and structure appear to vary considerably between study sites (e.g. pairs: White 1989; cohesive MM-MF: Balko 1998; fission-fusion: Morland 1991, Vasey 2003, Baden 2011, Baden <em>et al.</em> 2016), as do patterns of reproductive timing. The species is said to exhibit ‘boom-bust’ reproductive strategies [e.g., one reproductive event documented in 6 years of observation (Baden 2011, Baden <em>et al. </em>2013); ‘reproductive collapse’ observed in congener <em>V. rubra</em> (Vasey and Borgerson 2009); long IBI during this same time in Kianjavato (Holmes, unpublished data)], possibly mitigated by climatic variation/resource availability/abundance]. In breeding years, females usually give birth to two to three young (mean, 2.7 infants/litter; Baden <em>et al. </em>2013), which are left in a nest when young and afterwards carried in the mother’s mouth (Baden 2011, Baden <em>et al.</em> 2013). During gestation, ruffed lemur mothers build several nests, the location and density of which has been linked to the distribution and availability of preferred food resources within the area (Baden 2019). Ruffed lemurs are probably the only primates that build nests exclusively for the birth and the first days of rearing infants (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2008, and references therein).</p>  <p>Population and landscape genetics of the species at a range-wide scale suggest that anthropogenic pressures—specifically deforestation and human occupation—are the primary drivers of genetic structure across remaining populations of this species (Baden <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2019). Comparison of the population genetics between fragmented and continuous landscapes in the southeast, in particular, suggest that small geographic separation may not be enough to disrupt gene flow among <em>V. variegata </em>populations. Rather, fragment isolation or age may play a greater role than fragment size in the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation (Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p><p></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk28806173"">The principal threat to its survival is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and mining. They are large bodied and diurnal, and therefore also among the most heavily hunted of all lemur species. The seasonality of their vocalizations (due to increased food availability) has been tied to increased levels of hunting (Ratsimbazafy 2002, Vasey 2003). In Makira, where they are one of the more expensive and desired meats, hunting is largely unsustainable (Golden 2005). It is one of the first lemurs to disappear where humans encroach upon rain forest habitats (White <em>et al</em>. 1995). Morelli <em>et al.</em> (2020) presented in a recent publication how climate change and deforestation would impact the genus <em>Varecia</em> in the eastern rain forest of Madagascar, indicating that both factors could act together or independently, depending on the geographic region; thus, impacting <em>Varecia variegata</em> subspecies singly.&#160;For instance, Morelli <em>et al</em>. (2020) presented that Makira could be impacted by climate change regardless if forest covered remained at 2014 levels; therefore, impacting <em>V. v. subcincta</em> populations. Alternatively, <em>V. v. variegata</em> populations in the Ankeniheny–Zahamena Corridor could be impacted by loss of suitable habitat by deforestation alone, but climate change would restrict suitable habitat to the more southern aspect of this corridor (Morelli <em>et al</em>. 2020). Finally, the southern extent of the <em>Varecia v. editorum</em> in the Fandriana–Vondrozo Corridor could be decimated by deforestation alone but combined would eliminate all suitable habitat (Morelli <em>et al</em>. 2020). </a></p>","<p>                  </p><p><a name=""_Hlk28805414"">Population declines are suspected to have occurred in the past and be ongoing.

However, as reported to Madagascar National Parks in 2004, the 500 ha island of Nosy Mangabe and the isolated nature of its lemur populations are considered under risk due to overpopulation as morphometric data indicates severely undersized weights of the <em>Varecia</em> <em>v</em>. <em>subcincta</em> (Nosy Mangabe avg. 2.49 kg; 10 individuals; avg. of two 2.95 kg pregnant females in mid-October versus the standard range of 3.1-3.6 kg (Morland, 1991, Baden <em>et al</em>. 2008)) and <em>Eulemur</em> <em>albifrons</em> (Nosy Mangabe avg. 1.7 kg; 10 individuals; two 2.05 kg pregnant females in October versus standard weight of 2.0 kg; Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2010, E. Louis <em>pers. comm.</em>). No <em>Varecia</em> were recorded during 2007 surveys at Manombo (also completely absent from nearby Agnalazaha and closest interior forests) suggesting that the Manombo population is small and likely has not recovered from Cyclone Gretelle in 1997 due to the continuing threats of hunting and deforestation in the reserve and classified forest sections of the protected area. Population densities are unknown for most other populations throughout the range of all three subspecies. In 2007, Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium’s Conservation Genetics team and the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership, NGO in collaboration with Andasibe/Mantadia National Park and Eaux et Forêt initiated a re-introduction program of the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur, <em>V. v. variegata</em>, into Analamazaotra Special Reserve as this species and the Diademed sifaka, <em>Propithecus diadema</em>, had been extirpated from this protected area in the early 1970’s (Day <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160; The re-introduced Diademed Sifaka population has flourished, but unfortunately, hunting and other human impacts have limited the long-term survivability of the <em>Varecia</em> in this reserve (Rasoamanarivo <em>et al</em>. 2015). This approach does, however, show promise as a method of augmenting <em>Varecia</em> populations if the security of the forest can be established (Britt <em>et al.</em> 2003, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2013, Morelli <em>et al</em>. 2020). Unfortunately, <em>Varecia</em> is often specifically targeted by poachers as it is easily trapped in fruit-baited snares and for the flavour and quality of the meat (Golden 2005, Borgerson <em>et al</em>. 2016).</a></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><a name=""_Hlk28806460"">This species inhabits lowland to mid-altitude rain forests in eastern Madagascar from the Antainambalana River as its northern extent and Ambalavera Classified Forest which is just north of Midongy du Sud as its southerly recorded extent (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2013). The genus <em>Varecia</em> currently is represented by two species, <em>Varecia</em> <em>rubra,</em> the Red Ruffed Lemur,<em> </em>and<em> Varecia</em> <em>variegata, </em>the Black-and-white Ruffed Lemur. <em>Varecia</em> <em>rubra</em> has full species status whereas <em>Varecia</em> <em>variegata</em> includes three subspecies as follows: <em>Varecia</em> <em>v.</em> <em>subcincta</em>, <em>V</em>. <em>v</em>. <em>variegata</em>, and <em>V</em>. <em>v</em>. <em>editorum</em>.</a></p>  <p>The subspecies <em>V. v. subcincta</em> is thought to represent the northernmost subspecies with the northerly limit of its range being the Antainambalana River.&#160;<em>Varecia</em> <em>rubra</em> occupies the region east of the Antainambalana River, north until Antohaka-Lava Classified Forest, located southeast of Andapa (E. Patel<em>&#160;pers. comm.</em>) and the Masoala peninsula (Masoala National Park and World Heritage Site). There is some evidence of hybridization between <em>V. v. subcincta</em> and <em>V. rubra</em> in the region northeast of the Antainambalana River based on various patterns of coat colour; however, it hasn’t yet been extensively investigated utilizing molecular data (Vasey and Tattersall 2002). The southern range of <em>V.</em>&#160;<em>v. subcincta</em> is presumed to extend southwards to the Anova River, including part of Makira, Mananara-Nord, Atialanankorendrina, and Marotandrano protected areas. Furthermore, this subspecies was introduced to the island of Nosy Mangabe in the Bay of Antongil back in the 1930s and still occurs there (Kuhn 1972). The distribution of this lemur is very patchy throughout its range, except for Nosy Mangabe, where it lives at a relatively high density (Morland 1991).</p>  <p>The subspecies <em>V. v. variegata</em> occurs south of the Anova River from approximately Ambatovaky Special Reserve south to Betampona and Zahamena National Park. The northern extent of <em>V. v. variegata</em> and the southern range of <em>V. v. subcincta</em> have not been definitively defined; <em>V. v.</em> <em>variegata</em> is found in Ambatovaky, though its distribution throughout this reserve is unknown. Furthermore, the southern limit of <em>V. v. variegata</em> is also not yet clearly defined, but it is confirmed to be north of Mantadia National Park and Torotorofotsy Ramsar Site.</p>  <p>The subspecies <em>V. v. editorum</em> is the southernmost subspecies and is known with certainty only from Mantadia southwards to Manombo Special Reserve. There are additional populations of <em>V. variegata</em> south of Manombo Special Reserve at Ambalavera in the Midongy-Vondrozo Corridor (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2013) and also in small lowland forest fragments to the east of the Midongy-Vondrozo Corridor (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2013, The Aspinall Foundation unpubl. data); however, their subspecific status is not yet confirmed.</p>  <p>According to Groves (2001), the ranges of <em>V. v. editorum</em> and <em>V. v. variegata</em> overlap, and intermediate forms exist.

The relatively abundant Andriantantely population has become the focus of community-based conservation activities since 2010 (King <em>et al.</em> 2013, Seaman <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although the <em>Varecia v. editorum</em> population was extirpated from Analamazaotra Special Reserve in the early 1970’s, a re-introduction/translocation programme was initiated in 2006 which initially was promising. Unfortunately, hunting continues to impact this population. After growing to 25 individuals in five groups (2017) from a founding population of seven individuals, reports suggest that this population is now fewer than 15 individuals (E. Louis, <em>pers. obs.</em>). In November 1997, <em>V. v. editorum</em> born and raised in US zoological institutions were returned to Madagascar and released in the Betampona Reserve (Britt <em>et al.</em> 2003); however, predation by fossa (<em>Cryptoprocta</em> <em>ferox</em>) significantly impacted this re-inforcement programme.</p>  <p>Clarification of the taxonomic status of this species and species boundaries and distribution is a top priority.&#160;An education campaign against hunting, using this species as a flagship, is also recommended.</p>  <p>Over 800 <em>V. variegata</em> are held in captivity globally, in six regions (ZIMS 2019). In Europe, the species is managed in two separate breeding programmes (EEPs): one for individuals of the <em>V. v. subcincta</em> subspecies, the other for all other individuals (Johann<em> et al.</em> 2018). The <em>V. v. subcincta</em> EEP population comprises around 75 individuals but all descended from just four founder individuals and therefore has very low genetic diversity (Johann <em>et al.</em> 2018). The non-<em>subcincta</em> EEP population comprises approximately 350 individuals descended from 18 founders (Johann <em>et al.</em> 2018). The North American captive population is smaller at around 170 individuals, but is descended from 27 founders and is therefore considered more genetically diverse than the European population (Johann <em>et al.</em> 2018); however, it is not managed with respect of current subspecific taxonomy. Additional captive animals not included in the above figures are held in Madagascar, including approximately 45 in recognised facilities (E. Robsomanitrandrasana, <em>in. litt.</em> 2016) and several in illegal captivity (Reuter and Schafer 2017). A recent genetic study of mitochondrial DNA D-Loop sequences from ruffed lemurs in captivity in Europe and Madagascar illustrated that the European population had lower mtDNA diversity than the North American captive population, and that the Madagascan captive population had higher diversity than both (Vega <em>et al.</em> 2019). One of the haplotypes in the European population was not represented in the Madagascan captive population, and all haplotypes reported from the three captive populations were either identical to, or clustered with, published haplotypes from wild populations located north of the Mangoro River (Vega <em>et al. </em>2019).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This species has been the subject of ecological and behavioural studies in the forests of Ambatonakolahy (Rigamonti 1993), Andranobe on the Masoala Peninsula (Vasey 1997a, 2000, 2002, 2005, Martinez 2010, Borgerson 2016). The mating season is May-July, with births occurring from September through early November after a gestation period of about 102 days. Litters range from one to five infants in captivity, but usually contain two or three, and only one young every two years normally survive (Brockman <em>et al. </em>1987, Schwitzer 2003). Interbirth intervals are in the order of one to two years (Rakotondratsima and Kremen 2001). Females reach sexual maturity at just under two years, while males take three to four years to attain maturity. Social organization is described as fission/fusion; communities are usually multi-male/multi-female, and number 5–31 individuals in size with home ranges of 23–58 ha (Vasey 2005).</p>  <p><em>V. rubra</em> are characterized by extremely narrow niche dimensions. One of the best predictors of <em>V. rubra</em> population size is the total crown volume of large trees in that area (Borgerson 2016).&#160;<em>V. rubra</em> are highly frugivorous seed dispersers with fruits accounting for 61% of their diet (Martinez and Razafindratsimba 2014).&#160; They consistently use trees with the largest DBH, greatest height, and most voluminous crowns (Rigamonti 1993, Vasey 2000, 2002).

Hunting should also be considered a major threat as this species is known to crop-raid which puts them at further risk from humans attempting to protect their crops (Campera <em>et al. </em>2019, Eppley <em>pers. comm.</em>).&#160;Southern bamboo lemurs are able to survive in degraded habitats and this species is presumably edge tolerant (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2015a,&#160; 2017a).

The species inhabits both primary and mature secondary forests. Irrespective of the differences in overall structure and habitat parameters of the forest fragments in Ankarafa, the microhabitat in sportive lemurs’ home ranges as well as around sleeping sites was similar in all measured habitat parameters, as were all measured parameters for the different sleeping trees (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013b, 2014). Sahamalaza Sportive Lemurs chose the locations of their home ranges on the basis of different habitat variables, with abundance of sleeping sites and feeding trees as well as tree density and canopy cover being the most important factors (Seiler<em> et al. </em>2014). Tall trees with large crowns, a high density of small trees, and dense canopy were particularly important for sleeping site choice (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013b). </p>  <p>The Sahamalaza Sportive Lemur is a highly folivorous generalist herbivore and has been observed to feed on at least 42 different tree species, preferring the abundant species <em>Clitoria lasciva, Mangifera indica, Garcinia pauciflora</em> and <em>Sorindeia madagascariensis</em> and occasionally adding fruits of <em>Ficus tiliaefolia</em>, spiders, insects and insect larvae to its diet. It has prolonged periods of resting during its activity periods (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2014). Home ranges covered an area of 1.4 ha (nightly ranges of 0.5 ha) and did not overlap between adult individuals (Seiler 2012). The very few sociopositive interactions between individuals took place between mother and kin. Although the small number of observed individuals makes it hard to finally conclude on the social organization of the Sahamalza Sportive Lemur, the low level of social interaction and cohesiveness suggest that the Sahamalaza Sportive Lemur has a very low degree of social complexity and is likely to be solitary (Seiler 2012).</p>  <p>During daylight hours the Sahamalaza Sportive Lemur rested alone (except mother-infant pairs) in tree holes or in tree tangles (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2013b). Tree holes used as sleeping sites were usually found in <em>Bridelia pervilleana</em>, whilst tree tangle sleeping sites are mostly located in <em>Sorindeia madagascariensis</em>. Individuals resting in tree holes usually sat at the entrance rather than inside the hole, possibly to increase sun exposure. During diurnal observations, 5-14 % of the sportive lemurs’ behaviour was active, although the animals never leave their sleeping sites or feed. Comparing the proportion of active behaviour between individuals resting in tree holes and those in tree tangles, animals in tree holes to have significantly higher levels of activity (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013b). </p>  <p>Resting <em>Lepilemur sahamalaza</em> recognized predator vocalizations as indicators of increased predation risk, discerned vocalizations of different predators, and employed species-specific anti-predator behaviours (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2013c). Furthermore, the studied Sahamalaza Sportive Lemurs were able to use information on predator presence and predator type in referential signals of different surrounding species, thereby taking advantage of the possibility of early predator detection through interspecific communication (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2013d).</p><p></p>","<p>Although some of the known distribution is within a protected area, forest clearing for agriculture, and timber-cutting for charcoal and construction continues at high rates, especially since the onset of the political crisis in Madagascar in 2009.

This high encounter rate could be due to recent loss of habitat, forcing all animals to concentrate in the few remaining forest fragments. Ruperti (2007) recorded a mean density of 280 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Ankarafa. Most recent data on <em>Lepilemur</em> density (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013a) suggests densities ranging from only 7 to 23 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in the same area. The differences between density estimations are most likely due to different methods of data collection. Whereas Ruperti measured lemur density inside one-hectare plots (one for each fragment), Seiler <em>et al.</em> counted all individuals found during 12 months of field work. Another factor that may have contributed to the differences is ongoing habitat alteration. During the study period from 2009 to 2011, various observations were made of illegal logging (often hardwoods), slash-and-burn agriculture and poaching of the sportive lemurs on the Sahamalaza Peninsula (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2010,&#160;2012).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Lepilemur sahamalaza </em>is restricted to the Sahamalaza Peninsula.

Based on these premises, the species is listed as Endangered.","This species occurs in dry deciduous forests and in moist evergreen forest. The natural history of this species remains poorly studied by comparison to that of sportive lemurs inhabiting western and southern Madagascar. Adults seem to remain solitary during nightly bouts of foraging for leaves. Tree holes and vine tangles are preferred daytime shelters. The Madagascar ground boa is known to prey upon sportive lemurs in their sleeping sites. A study of this species in degraded secondary forest fragments south of Montagne d’Ambre National Park found that the animals eat a high proportion of fruits during the rainy season when fruits are abundant, whereas they only eat leaves during the dry season. The fruits of five plant families were consumed: Moraceae, Verbenaceae, Rubiaceae, Pittosporaceae, and one that was not identified. The species has also been observed to feed on latex (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2008 and references therein).","The major threats to this species are forest loss, particularly for charcoal (such as in Analamerana and Andrafiamena), and hunting (exacerbated by mining in the region for sapphires).

In Cambodia’s Virachey National Park, large areas have been cleared for rubber plantations in recent years, particularly on its eastern side, and the area is also subjected to illegal logging for luxury timber.&#160;<a>In addition, road building along Cambodia’s northern border with Lao PDR is contributing to further habitat degradation and increased accessibility to remote parts of this landscape&#160;</a>(P. Sinovas pers. comm. 2020). In Viet Nam, habitats for&#160;<em>Nomascus&#160;annamensis</em>&#160;are heavily fragmented due to logging and agricultural encroachment, and a high population density of humans continues to threaten this species’ habitat and population numbers<a>.<br/></a><br/>Lack of enforcement and hunting with guns presents quite a danger to the conservation of the taxon throughout its range. The species is used in traditional 'medicine', for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1999, Geissmann&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Duc<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Rawson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;<a>In recent years, the amount of logging&#160;and the use&#160;of guns in Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park has increased (McGrath and Behie in prep.).&#160;</a><span lang=""EN-GB"">In 2017, through interviews with local people in five villages adjacent to VSSPNP, it was found that the most sought-after primate species in VSSPNP for use as a pet was&#160;<em>N.&#160;annamensis</em>, with 43.75%<span lang=""EN-GB"">&#160;of participants willing to keep one as a pet. Despite this,&#160;<em>N. annamensis&#160;</em>is rarely hunted in Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park, which may be due to a lack of hunting equipment, as this was the most frequently reported as the reason for not hunting other primates in the area (McGrath and Behie 2019).&#160;Interviews conducted in 2019 with local communities along the southern edge of Virachey National Park to understand prevalence of primate hunting found that&#160;<em>N. annamensis</em>&#160;was generally not targeted and only very rarely caught (<a>FFI unpublished data</a>).&#160;<br/><br/>Virtually no species-specific information on international trade is available as, until 2013, the species was not recognised as a separate taxon by CITES. According to the CITES trade database, reported trade to date consists of low levels of scientific samples from Viet Nam to Germany in 2016 and 2018 (P. Sinovas pers. comm. 2020). In general, within the range of&#160;<em>N. annamensis</em>, gibbons are traded for their meat, and, to a lesser extent, as pets.&#160;Cross border trade of wildlife, especially from Lao PDR and Cambodia into Viet Nam occurs.&#160;Hunting, in particular, is a major threat in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR.<br/><a><br/>In addition to losses suffered due to hunting for food and medicinal purposes, as well as live capture for the illegal pet trade, this species is impacted by historic and ongoing significant tropical forest loss throughout its range</a>. According to the most recent Global Forest Watch reports, since declining populations were first noted in 2001, Viet Nam has lost 16% of its forest cover to date and could lose as much as 56% by the year 2045 if current rates continue. Lao PDR has also lost 16% of its forest cover to date and could lose as much as 52% by the year 2045 if current rates continue, and Cambodia has already lost 25% of its former forest cover to date and could lose as much as 70% by the year 2045 if current rates continue.</span></p>","<p>More than 220 groups were   recorded in Viet Nam between 2000 and 2015 (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).

A 2010 population survey in adjacent Veun Sai and Siem Pang districts (now Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park) estimated&#160;<a>approximately 500 groups&#160;</a>(Rawson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<a>2012</a>). A subsequent analysis of the same data from Veun Sai-Siem Pang reported that 77 groups had been detected and gave an estimated population density of 0.32 calling groups/km<sup>2</sup>, but concluded that no population estimate could be given for the entire park as variance due to inter-array variation in the encounter rate could not be accounted for (Kidney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In a 2019 survey of the same locations, 92&#160;<em>N. annamensis</em>&#160;calling groups were detected (solo males excluded) across 13 sites located at least 4 km apart throughout Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park&#160;(McGrath and Behie in prep<a>)</a>.<br/><br/>No recent population data for   Lao PDR exists although, again, populations could be significant including in In   Xe Pian NPA, where an estimated population of 400-6,720 groups exist   (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995). According to Thien<em> et al.</em> (2017), in central Viet Nam, sound recording in eight protected areas, of which 171 individuals were of <em>N. annamensis</em> (73 males and 98 females), gave a total estimate of 71 groups.

The same rate of decline is also inferred in the future. In Peru, the species' habitat has suffered massive deforestation of ~35,000 ha/year and increasing (Llactayo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Agricultural expansion in the species' extent of occurrence (EOO) in Brazil is also severely reducing its habitat (Barona <em>et al</em>. 2010). The species is also commonly found in the illegal pet trade in Peru (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015). The long-term (~40 years) offtake at the Brazil-Colombia-Peru tri-border area, where 4,000 animals were trapped in a 24-month period for biomedical research (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2009), is reflected by the decrease of their populations mainly in Peru (Maldonado and Peck 2014).&#160;</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Nancy Ma’s Night Monkey is part of the red-necked group of night monkeys, with a diploid chromosome number of 54 (Ford 1994). They are found in flooded and un-flooded tropical forest. Higher population densities have been found in flooded forests owing to the availability of tree holes, their preferred sleeping sites. Lowland swamp, pre-montane forests up to ~1,000 m asl. and inundated dense vine tangles are also used by <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015; Aquino and Encarnación 1986a,b; Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Tahuayo River (Peru), <em>A. nancymaae</em> had 21.4% of its sleeping sites in the shrub stratum of the understory, 64.3% in the lower story and 14.3% in the middle story. No sleeping sites were found in the upper story or in emergent trees for this species (Aquino and Encarnación 1986a).<br/><br/>Night monkeys are generally nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk. They are omnivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flowers (seasonally important for <span lang=""EN-US""><em>A. a. azarae</em><span lang=""EN-US""> in the Chaco), leaves, and small animal prey such as insects (Wright 1989, Fernandez-Duque 2007). Nancy Ma’s Night Monkeys live in small groups that range from two individuals in hunting areas of north-eastern Peru (Maldonado and Peck 2014) to an average of 3.4 individuals in the Rio Tahuayo, northwestern Peru (Aquino and Encarnación 1988).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, with extensive male care of offspring (Rotundo<em> </em><span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em><span lang=""EN-US"">.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2002, 2005; Wright 1984, Wolowich and Evans 2007), living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult). There may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002, Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 1-18 ha (depending on the species, location and level of habitat fragmentation) (Wright 1978, Fernandez-Duque 2007,&#160;Garcia and Braza 1987, Castaño <em>et al</em>. 2010, Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2013a).

Most social interactions between mates consist of anogenital- and nose-sniffing, urine-rinking, and partner-marking with the subcaudal gland. They also reported the frequent use of a variety of potential chemical signals including scent-marking with their muzzles, sternal glands, and subcaudal glands as well as urinating and urine-washing.<br/><br/><strong>Size:</strong><br/>In Captivity: Adult male weight averages 0.946±0.14 kg (n=4, range 0.750-1.08 kg), adult female weight 0.907±0.124 kg (n=6, range 0.706-1.05 kg) (S.

In Brazil, deforestation in Amazonas state is driven by the expansion of the agricultural frontier mainly for cattle pasture and soy-bean production (Barona <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Studies of illegal trade in primates for Peru have regularly encountered <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> in markets and other forms of trafficking (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although quantitative estimates do not exist, it is suspected that this trade is having a negative effect on populations in large areas of this species’ distribution.<br/><br/>The extraction of night monkeys for malaria research is drastically affecting wild populations in the tri-border area of Brazil-Colombia-Peru. In Peru, densities range from 13.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in areas where animals are trapped (Maldonado and Peck 2014) to 46.3 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Aquino and Encarnacion 1986a) where trapping does not occur. This might be the result of long<span lang=""EN-US"">‐<span lang=""EN-US"">term extraction for the biomedical research market or a result of deforestation associated with destructive trapping methods.

Its southern limit is in the headwaters of the Rio Jutai, stretching west in a line to cross the Río Javari at the level of the headwaters of the Río Tapiche, across the Ucayali basin to the upper Río Marañón (Hershkovitz 1983, Aquino and Encarnación&#160;1988, 1994a). The northern boundary in Peru is the right bank of the Amazonas to the Río Marañón, occurring to the north of the Marañón between the ríos Tigre and Pastaza (Aquino and Encarnación 1994), invading the distribution of <span lang=""EN-US""><em>A. vociferans</em><span lang=""EN-US""> north of the Amazonas and Marañón. The western boundary of the species' distribution in Peru is the Andean foothills in San Martin up to ~1,000 m above sea level (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Colombia, the distribution of <em>A. nancymaae</em> is uncertain owing to the existence of a possible endemic subpopulation and an introduced subpopulation. Bloor <em>et al</em>. (2012) report the species north of the Amazon River, west from San Juan de Atacuari, border with Peru. Maldonado and Peck (2014) reported the predicted distribution of <em>A. nancymaae</em> in Colombia, where the species has been released after malaria research. Although the species is present all along the Amazon River, the distribution of the endemic subpopulation is limited to the Loretoyacu River basin. In Colombia its distribution range is approximately 652 km<sup>2</sup> (MADS 2015).</span></span></p>","Since 1984 <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> has been traded illegally from Peru and Brazil to Colombia for malaria research and later released to the wild in Colombian territory (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2009, Ruiz-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2013). Trapping permits for malaria research are granted by the regional environmental authority, Corpoamazonia, to the biomedical facility FIDIC, in Leticia, Colombia. SINCHI (the Research Institute for the Colombian Amazon) and the Genetics Laboratory of the Colombian National University – IGUN-UNAL - (CITES Scientific Authorities) conducted a pilot project to gather baseline information on the genetics and ecology of <em>Aotus</em> spp. where the FIDIC had been trapping and releasing animals. Results from the UNAL/SINCHI study confirmed the presence of <em>A. nancymaae</em> in Colombian territory and suggested the existence of a historical distribution of <em>A. nancymaae</em> north of the Amazon River, as well as of another population of <em>A. nancymaae</em>, not of historical lineage but probably introduced in Colombia in more recent times (Bloor <em>et al</em>. 2012). Bearing in mind the reduced distribution of this species in Colombia, ~652 km<sup>2</sup>, the study recommended the prohibition of extraction of <em>A. nancymaa</em>e in Colombia (MADS 2015). Nonetheless, in August 2016 the regional environmental authority (Corpoamazonia) granted another research permit for the capture of 1,463 adult <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> for a period of 566 days (Svensson <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is commonly found in Peruvian indigenous communities for exhibition to tourists and as pets (Maldonado and Waters 2017). In Peru <em>A. nancymaae</em> are regularly found in the illegal pet trade (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015). This species can easily be found for live sale or kept as pets in northern Peru in all areas of its range, but particularly in the Belen market of Iquitos, Peru as well as skins and stuffed animals sold as adornments.

121745669,712,Ailuropoda melanoleuca,Vulnerable,C2a(i); D1,2016,2016-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) produced an estimated range-wide population of 1,864 Giant Pandas, excluding dependent young &lt;1.5 years of age (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although no formal demographic analysis is available, there are demographic data available to enable estimation of age-related population composition (Sichuan Forestry Department 2015): if the population consists of 9.6% cubs, then the total population of Pandas is approximately 2,060. Mature adults are estimated to compose 50.5% of the total population, yielding an estimate of 1,040. Although this estimate does not contain confidence intervals, clearly the lower confidence interval would fall below 1,000 mature individuals, which meets the small population size criteria (D1) for Vulnerable.<br/><br/>Additionally, the species falls under criteria C2. The Panda population is fragmented into subpopulations, each of which contains &lt;1,000 adults (given that the total population is &lt;1,000 adults); however, the size of the largest population is unknown given uncertainty in how much connectivity remains. It appears that at least one distinct populations in the Minshan mountains contains &gt;400 mature individuals (State Forestry Administration 2015), so the species does not meet the criteria for Endangered (EN). The most tentative part of listing under C2 is a continued population decline.<br/><br/>Evidence from a series of range-wide national surveys indicate that the previous population decline has been arrested, and the population has started to increase (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although inconsistencies in data collection methods, analysis, and sampling area make direct comparisons from survey results difficult, population estimates have consistently increased across survey since the Second National Survey conducted during 1985-1988. Initial uncertainties regarding whether modest population increases observed in the Third National Survey (2000-2004) were real warranted maintaining the Endangered status for the Giant Panda in the previous Red List assessment. Recent data from the Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) remove this uncertainty (State Forestry Administration 2015), and it is widely believed that the population has stabilized and has begun to increase in many parts of the range.<br/><br/>An increase in available habitat and an expanding occupied range provide further support for the contention that Panda numbers are increasing. Forest protection and reforestation measures have increased forest cover in China (FAO 2010), and have supported an 11.8% increase in occupied habitat and 6.3% increase in unoccupied but suitable habitat between the Third and Fourth National Surveys (State Forestry Administration 2015). A survey of expert opinion among Giant Panda experts in the IUCN Bear Specialist Group was consistent with the results of the national survey: all believed that the Panda population was stable or increasing and that available habitat was increasing.<br/><br/>Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate &gt;35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Under this scenario, the species fits the criteria for VU under C2a(i).<br/><br/>Whereas the decision to downlist the Giant Panda to Vulnerable is a positive sign confirming that the Chinese government's efforts to conserve this species are effective, it is critically important that these protective measures are continued and that emerging threats are addressed. The threat of declining bamboo availability due to climate change could, in the near future, reverse the gains made during the last two decades. The Giant Panda will remain a conservation-dependent species for the foreseeable future. The Chinese government's plan to expand existing conservation policy for the species (State Forestry Administration 2015) should receive strong support to ensure its implementation.","A member of the order Carnivora, Giant Pandas have evolved to specialize on a diet of bamboo (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Bamboo is a poor food source, low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, and wild Giant Pandas can only digest an average of 17% of dry matter and about 27% of hemi-cellulose (Dierenfeld <em>et al.</em> 1982, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1985). Thus, to meet their daily energy requirement, Giant Pandas must consume a large amount of bamboo, up to 12.5 kg per day, and defecate more than 100 times daily (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Pandas have large, muscular jaws with skeletal features to accommodate the musculature and its famous “pseudothumb” used to hold and manipulate bamboo for processing. However, compared with other herbivores, the Panda has very low digestive efficiency because its digestive tract still resembles that of its carnivorous ancestors. The Panda’s feeding strategy emphasizes volume, requiring it to allocate much of its time to foraging (approximately 14 hours daily).<br/><br/>While morphological and behavioural adaptations provide some compensation for poor digestive efficiency, the Panda’s ability to survive on such a low-quality food source remained mysterious for decades. Even whole-genome sequencing found no specific genes responsible for the digestion of cellulose and hemi-cellulose (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010). An explanation was uncovered in a recent metagenomics study that found the Panda’s gut microbes play an important role in digesting bamboo fibers (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Additional adaptations to poor quality diet are found in the Panda’s extreme strategy of energy conservation, with daily energy expenditure comparable to that of a sloth or reptile (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Pandas demonstrate a suite of adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. The thick pelage conserves energy lost through body heat, and it has long been known that pandas are conservative in movement and physical activity. Smaller than expected organs also are indicative of energy-conservation adaptation, and down-regulation of resting metabolic rate has been achieved through a mutation in the synthesis pathway for thyroid hormones.<br/><br/>Giant Pandas also compensate for digestive inefficiency by selecting the most nutritious parts of bamboo plants and by altering diet selection seasonally commensurate with changes in nutritional profiles of bamboo species (Schaller<em> et al.</em> 1985, Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015b). They demonstrate strong preference for seasonally available new bamboo shoots, rich in nutrition and energy and low in fibre. Outside the late spring bamboo shoot season, Pandas favour leaves, although more stems are incorporated into their diet during the winter months when leaf quality and quantity diminishes. This convergence of foraging strategies across variations in climate, bamboo species, and topographic profile indicates an adaptive strategy that serves the species well. Still, as an energy-limited species that spends more than 50% of its time foraging, Panda numbers may be limited by the availability of high quality bamboo and the time required to process bamboo in the digestive system.<br/><br/>Early coarse-scale radio tracking using VHF transmitters provided foundational data on home range size and documented the solitary nature of the Panda’s existence (Schaller<em> et al</em>. 1985, Yong <em>et al. </em>1994, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). Although Panda home ranges overlap generously, direct encounters between individuals are rare. Seasonal elevational migration has been documented in the Qionglai (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985) and Qinling mountains (Yong <em>et al.</em> 1994, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). At both sites, the seasonal movements track changes in resources, providing access to bamboo species that provide greater nutritional value. Research integrating behavioural, nutritional, and movement data provide new insights into these seasonal migration patterns, demonstrating that these movements facilitate consumption of higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of key nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca) (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014). Female-biased dispersal has been demonstrated with genetic data in the Minshan and Liangshan Mountains (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hu <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Fine-scale documentation of |Panda movement behaviour had to await the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Published accounts using high-resolution GPS telemetry revised and added to previous findings (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hull <em>et al. </em>2015). VHF-based radio tracking inevitably leads to large amounts of missing data when animals at more distant locations are not detected, thus it is unsurprising that GPS tracking substantively revised home range size upwards, and that core area overlap and opportunity for social interactions is now understood to be greater than previously believed. Other interesting phenomena were also detected, such as the documentation of female-biased dispersal (confirmed with genetic data; Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007), and sudden, large movements that temporarily took a female far outside of her home range during the mating season. Fine-scale movement data showed that Pandas exhibited individualistic and multiphasic movement paths within seasonal core habitats and large-scale movements between habitats. Tortuous movement paths indicated when pandas searched for and found foraging resources. Pandas frequently return to the same foraging patches, indicating that they likely have well-developed spatial memory.<br/><br/>Using various measures of habitat suitability, efforts to map Panda habitat have proven valuable for guiding the establishment of the Panda reserve system (Shen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Feng <em>et al.</em> 2009, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant Pandas typically occupy temperate montane forests at altitudes of 1,500–3,000 m (Hu and Wei 2004). Range-wide analysis of ecological covariates associated with Panda presence suggested that Giant Pandas are associated with old growth forests, a finding previously unrecognised in studies implemented on smaller spatial scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). As an obligate bamboo specialist, the Giant Panda’s reliance on this resource is clear, yet it has usually been ignored in habitat suitability models because mapping bamboo understory using remote sensing techniques is difficult (Linderman<em> et al. </em>2005). Including understory bamboo in habitat models dramatically decreases estimates of available habitat and increases measures of fragmentation. Advances in remote sensing techniques, such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), combined with new analytical techniques, such as artificial neural network analysis, have helped remove obstacles to including bamboo understory in maps of habitat suitability (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2009; Viña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Enhanced understanding of Panda habitat requirements and improvements in mapping technologies provide managers and policy makers with better tools for conservation decision-making (Loucks <em>et al.</em> 2003, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Qi <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Giant Pandas are a solitary and seasonal-breeding mammal, only coming together during the breeding season, from March to May, for reproductive purposes (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Male Pandas occupy large home ranges overlapping several females and are known to congregate around oestrous females. Male Pandas are able to locate females across large areas, and demonstrate fierce and injurious aggression in competition for access to females. Early in these encounters escalated aggression is common, but, in a possible strategy to conserve energy and minimize risk of injury, once dominance is established, contact aggression is largely replaced with non-contact aggression. Individual males are able to locate and mate with multiple females sequentially, so the mating system might be considered scramble competition polygyny.<br/><br/>Because Pandas live a solitary existence, they must rely heavily on chemosignals to communicate with one another without necessitating face-to-face encounters. Giant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations that provide them with reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other Pandas (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985). Studies documenting habitat characteristics of preferred marking sites, including tree species and microhabitat (Nie <em>et al. </em>2012a), extend our understanding of habitat requirements for the species. If habitat that promotes communication is not maintained, then poor communication may hinder breeding in the wild, as has been shown for captive Pandas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Denning ecology is an important field of study among ursids, and other species giving birth in dens, because access to adequate dens can be important for offspring survival. Forest management practices that affect the availability of suitable dens can either significantly harm or enhance cub survival (White<em> et al. </em>2001). Ursid young, being extremely altricial, are particularly vulnerable. The Giant Panda lies at the extreme end of this continuum, with the mother weighing nearly 1,000 times the cub’s weight at birth (Gittleman 1994). Den quality may therefore be critical for Pandas. Giant Pandas do not hibernate, but females use rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every 2–3 years (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2001). Preferred dens are characterized by a small opening to buffer against the elements and provide a warmer and drier environment for rearing offspring (Zhang<em> et al. </em>2007). Dens tend to be located close to water, presumably so the mother can leave the vulnerable cub (almost always a single cub) unattended for a shorter period of time while she drinks. It has also been proposed that tree dens, once more numerous in primary forests before logging converted many forests in Panda habitat to second growth, are a limiting resource for Giant Pandas (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). The importance of this resource may explain why national survey data indicate that pandas are more often found in primary than secondary forest.<br/><br/>It was once believed, and sometimes still mis-stated, that Pandas’ biological deficiencies were responsible for their own decline. Because of early problems with captive breeding, Pandas gained a reputation for having notoriously low levels of interest in mating; however, Pandas in the wild experience no mating problems and have high reproductive rates (Wei and Hu 1994, Pan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Once a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of the species was incorporated into husbandry practices, captive Pandas began to mate naturally and experienced exponential population growth (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2006, Zhang and Wei 2006, Martin-Wintle <em>et al.</em> 2016). Moreover, its well-known specialization on bamboo is not (as once thought) an evolutionary cul de sac, as it opens up a foraging niche with plentiful resources and few competitors (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dietary specialization is often seen as an extinction risk factor, but this may not be the case for the Panda, which specializes on widespread and abundant bamboo. Thus, pandas are well-adapted to their environment and have reproductive rates sufficiently high to explain the recovery of populations once bans on poaching and habitat restoration efforts commenced (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The primary threat facing Giant Panda populations is the continuing effects of previous habitat loss, resulting in highly fragmented habitat and, in many cases small, isolated populations. According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>Although microsatellite analysis (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Shan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and genomics (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.<br/><br/>Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin <em>et al.</em> 2010; Zhang, L. <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.<br/><br/>Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li <em>et al.</em> 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species.","The Giant Panda is the subject of one of the largest, most intensive efforts to estimate population size for an entire species. The Chinese government has carried out four national surveys, approximately every 10 years since 1974. The most recent, the Fourth National Survey conducted from 2011 to 2014, mobilized more than 2,000 people who spent more than 60,000 person-days surveying 4.36 million ha. The population estimates derived from these surveys should be considered rough estimates due to difficulty associated with extrapolating sign survey data to determine the number of individuals. Idiosyncratic feeding styles among individual pandas produce bamboo fragments that vary somewhat distinctively in size (“bite-size”) between individuals and thus provide some information that helps distinguish faeces from different individuals, especially when combined with information about home range size. However, as a population census tool, this method has never been fully validated (Pan<em> et al. </em>2014). Evidence suggests that sign survey data may have under-estimated population size in one reserve (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wei <em>et al. </em>2012), but it is not known to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other reserves. Although DNA has been extracted from faeces collected during the Fourth National Survey, these data have not yet yielded a population estimate because most of the faeces collected were not sufficiently fresh to provide adequate DNA. Thus, the best available population estimate for the species relies on bite-size analysis.<br/><br/>Another limitation of the national survey data is that the methods have been altered and improved since they commenced in 1974, and the range and effort of the survey have been inconsistent. The same methods were used for the third and fourth national surveys; although survey effort increased in the fourth survey, most of this increase can be attributed to the larger area covered to capture the expanding range that Pandas now occupy. Thus, comparisons between surveys may not be completely valid, but they are still informative. The first survey (1974–1977) produced an estimate of 2,459 pandas, which decreased dramatically in the second survey (1985–1988) to 1,216 individuals. This approximately 50% drop in population size provided the impetus for the 1988 Wildlife Protection act, which banned Panda poaching, and China’s <em>National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat</em>, which established a reserve system for Pandas (Reid and Gong 1999). By the time of the third survey (2000–2004), the population estimate increased to 1,596, indicating that these protective measures may have been successful. However, uncertainties remained due to the inconsistencies in the methods by which the surveys were implemented (as well as a lack of confidence limits on the point estimates). Although these same limitations still apply, the recent fourth survey showed the Panda population increased further to 1,864, removing most remaining uncertainties regarding population trend. Additionally, Pandas have been documented in many areas outside their known range, including an animal shot in 2015 in Yunnan Province, where they have not been recorded for centuries. An increasing population was not surprising, given that available and occupied habitats have increased. <br/><br/>The optimism engendered by these positive trends is dampened by evidence indicating that some Panda populations are decreasing, particularly those found in the smallest and most degraded habitat patches such as Liangshan, Xiangling and Niuweihe. Approximately 223 pandas occupying 23 isolated habitat patches are considered at high risk of local extinction, and will require increased protection and management (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011b; State Forestry Administration 2015).",Increasing,"Once widespread throughout southern China, and as far north as Beijing and south into Southeast Asia, the Panda’s distribution is now confined to its previous western extremity in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Pleistocene range shifts were associated with the disappearance of the Panda’s principal source of food, bamboo, due to warming climate; whereas rapid range contraction in the past several hundred years is attributed to the conversion of bamboo forests to agricultural cultivation and rapid expansion of human populations (Li <em>et al.</em> 2015). The largest populations are currently found in the Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai mountain ranges, and smaller, more isolated populations remain in the Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiangling mountain ranges (State Forestry Administration 2015).<br/><br/>The Giant Panda’s range is highly fragmented, resulting from centuries of human encroachment and loss of forested habitat at lower elevations. Rapidly expanding industrialization, beginning in the early 1900s and accelerating since 1949, is associated with severe contraction of the Panda’s range (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li<em> et al. </em>2015). While they once occupied forests below 1,000 m in elevation, current populations are restricted to mountain ranges, separated by valleys and flatter landscapes that have been altered by human activities. China lost more than 30% of its forests between 1950 and 2004, coinciding with a precipitous drop in Panda populations, but forest cover has increased in the past two decades (FAO 2010).","Although historically the Giant Panda was sometimes hunted for its pelt, law enforcement mechanisms appear to have eliminated this trade.",Terrestrial,"The Giant Panda has been the focus of one of the most intensive, high profile efforts to recover an endangered species. In 1981, China joined the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which made trade of Panda skins illegal. Enactment of the 1988 Wildlife Protection Law banned poaching and conferred protected status to the Giant Panda (listed as Category I, the highest level of protection). The National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat of 1992 laid out a masterplan for Panda conservation and established a Panda reserve system, which today has grown to 67 reserves. Enlarged by more than 50% since the Third National Survey, this reserve system currently protects 67% of the Panda population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of Panda habitat (State Forestry Administration 2015). The biological diversity of these reserves is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems (Mackinnon 2008), thus making the Panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other sympatric species (Noss 1990).<br/><br/>These efforts to end poaching and protect Panda habitat played a significant role in Panda recovery. The Chinese government also invested in infrastructure and capacity building for reserve staff, established anti-poaching patrol, curtailed human activities inside reserves, and in some cases relocated human settlements from inside to outside of reserves. Other measures directed at broader conservation problems also benefited the Panda. The Natural Forest Conservation Program was implemented in 1997 to reduce the devastating impacts of flooding on human communities due to deforestation and erosion. The program banned logging in most forests in Panda habitat, slowing habitat degradation. Additionally, the Grain-to-Green Program incentivized farmers to plant trees on steep slopes to slow erosion. The result of these policies was the addition of 3 million hectares of forest cover in China annually, an increase of 1.6% per year from 2000 to 2010 (FAO 2010). As a consequence, Panda habitat is recovering and the total occupied habitat has increased by 11.8% between the Third and the Fourth National Surveys; an additional 6.3% increase in suitable but unoccupied habitat was also observed. In the Wolong Nature Reserve, implementation of the Grain-to-Green Program brought about measurable increases in connectivity of Panda habitat (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007). Thus, these habitat conservation policies are associated with increasing Panda population size, increasing range, and better habitat connectivity. Efforts have also commenced to restore habitat corridors (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a) and to reintroduce captive-born pandas to increase genetic diversity in small, isolated populations.<br/><br/>Ecocompensation has been proposed as an important component of a conservation strategy for pandas (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2015; Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 15% of the remaining unprotected habitat occurs in collectively-owned forests. Payment for ecosystem services, which has already been shown to benefit Panda conservation under the Grain-to-Green Program, could extend conservation measures into these unprotected areas.<br/><br/>Finally, the Giant Panda has been the beneficiary of a massive scientific effort conducted in partnerships between the Chinese government and institutions and international conservation NGOs and zoos (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a, State Forestry Administration 2015). Once poorly understood, there has been an explosion of scientific studies across many disciplines, and this knowledge has increasingly been applied management and policy decisions. Future directions would benefit from even better coordination between science and policy, and the application of adaptive management principles in which experiments are conducted to evaluate management actions that may increase carrying capacity inside protected areas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a).<br/><br/>China's State Forestry Administration, while rightfully proud of its accomplishments, fully realizes that more work needs to be done to further Panda conservation and to avoid losing ground so painstakingly gained. They plant to continue investing in habitat protection, population monitoring, and protection patrols, and to further develop capacity of reserve staff (State Forestry Administration 2015). They recognize the challenges the future holds, and in particular will seek to address problems of habitat connectivity and population fragmentation.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The North America bison population underwent a drastic decline in the 19th century caused by over hunting but has since partially recovered. There has been a modest increases in the number of conservation herds and individuals in populations managed for species conservation and ecological restoration, however, all mature individuals occur within active management programs which if ceased would result in the species qualifying for a threatened status. About 97% of the continental population is managed for private captive commercial propagation; very few of these herds are managed primarily for species conservation and none is managed in the public interest for conservation. Herds managed for conservation purposes in the public interest are typically small (&lt;400), and populations are widely dispersed with few geographic situations that provide conditions for natural movements between subpopulations. The total number of mature individuals in wild free-ranging and semi-free-ranging populations is estimated to be approximately 11,248-13,123 and only 4 subpopulations have more than 1,000 individuals, thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). The species is not currently in decline but wild mature individuals could be greatly reduced if current management regimes are changed or removed. This is a conservation dependant species.<br/> <br/> The current number of ecologically restored large populations managed primarily for conservation (populations exceeding 1,000 and managed in the presence of most natural limiting factors) is small. The species is most limited in Mexico, where only one herd may remain in the wild; it is subject to adverse policies when individuals move across the international border into the United States where they are classified as livestock. Creation of opportunities for a few additional, large-scale ecological restoration projects is dependent on cooperation between government agencies and non-government organizations. Future progress in conservation and recovery of the North American bison will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by federal and state/provincial agencies, harmonization of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organizations, and public tolerance and support of wild, free-ranging bison managed as wildife on limited, large-scale landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different agencies or organizations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">The likelihood of wild bison increasing over the next five years is entirely dependent upon conservation interventions.&#160;Currently six of the 20 wild herds representing 11,956 animals (63.7%) are anchored by National Parks, Refuges or Sanctuaries. Without these large protected landscapes bison would not likely survive and the future survival of American bison would be in serious jeopardy. Beyond these 6 herds in protected areas the remaining 14 wild herds are dependent upon conservation actions and management decisions by conservation programs of States, Tribes and Provinces who regulate the populations to assure sustainability of these herds.&#160;None of the 20 wild bison herds would persist without the management prescriptions and subsequent actions of the managing authorities.&#160;Wood bison are currently protected under the Species at Risk Act and are managed under a National Recovery Strategy.&#160;Hence, wild bison (wood or plains) are totally dependent upon conservation actions and protected lands.&#160;American Bison would not persist without those intensive conservation measures.</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">North American bison are primarily grazers and forage primarily in grassland and meadow vegetative communities. They had the widest natural range of any North American herbivore, from the arid grasslands of Chihuahua State in northern Mexico, through the grasslands of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, to the riparian meadows of interior Alaska. They can persist in arid regions (e.g. Mexico and New Mexico) and in areas experiencing deep snow cover (e.g., Yellowstone National Park). Grasses and sedges form the mainstay of the annual diet in all regions. However, summer and fall diets may be broader, including flowering plants, woody plant leaves, and lichens, in addition to grasses and sedges, depending on local availability. Bison excavate snow at foraging sites by sweeping it away using side to side motions of their muzzle. The plains bison undertook seasonal migrations when they were abundant prior to European settlement of the continent. Bison no longer migrate owing to land use change contributing to range restriction and depopulation. The Wood Bison was not migratory and remains so. Both subspecies exhibit strong seasonal aggregation during the calving through breeding seasons (May through August).</p>","In the 19th Century, market, subsistence and recreational hunting nearly eliminated the bison throughout its range in North America. Conservation measures have brought about limited recovery in the wild and in captive conservation herds. Private commercial production of bison has resulted in significant numerical recovery, but does not provide for conservation of the bison as wildlife in the sense used for Red List designation. Existing threats include: habitat loss; genetic manipulation of commercial bison for market traits; small population effects in most conservation herds; few herds are exposed to a full range of natural limiting factors (natural selection); cattle gene introgression; loss of genetic non-exchangeability through hybridization between bison subspecies; and the threat of depopulation as a management response to infection of some wild populations hosting reportable cattle diseases. Canada, the United States and Mexico list bison nationally as both wildlife and domestic livestock. Legal status varies among State and Provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, four provinces and two territories classify bison as both wildlife and livestock. Bison are legally classified as livestock in the United Sates only 10 states classify bison as wildlife in all or portions of the state. An additional threat to populations of this species is culling to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.","There are approximately 31,000 total bison in 68 conservation herds (herds managed in the public interest by governments and environmental organizations) in North America. These include about 20,000 Plains Bison and 11,000 total Wood Bison. For this assessment we applied a rigorous set of criteria to classify herds as functioning as wild, functioning as wild with limitations and not functioning as wild. We excluded from this assessment 30 of 68 conservation bison herds that are very small (&lt;300) and managed on small landscapes (&lt;10,000 acres) for education, public viewing and research. Based on our criteria these bison cannot function as wild bison under current management schemes. We also did not include 9,523 bison in 18 herds managed behind fences and held in captivity, although these are important conservation herds. These herds are considered captive, intensively husbanded and culled by artificial selection.<br/><br/>There are 14,703 bison in eight herds that are in populations &gt;400 and function as wild bison subject to the full range of natural selections forces. Another 4,044 wild bison are found in 12 herds that free-range but suffer from small populations size (&lt;400) and may experience limited predation from large carnivores. For this assessment we considered the wild bison population to be 18,748 bison from these 20 free-ranging herds occupying large landscapes and primarily subjected to the forces of natural selection. We conducted Population Viability Analyses (PVA) for the eight largest herds to determine both the demographic and genetic viability of each population and their viability if they were managed as a meta-population out to 200 years (see the attached PVA report).<br/><br/>The number of calves and yearlings in a bison population will vary considerably between populations and years (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2008). Therefore It is difficult to establish the exact number of mature individuals in each of 20 bison herds but demographic data from many show that 30-40% are individuals under 2 years of age. We estimated that there are between 11,248 and 13,123 mature bison in the current populations of wild free-ranging bison in North America.<br/><br/>Populations are considered viable in the long term if they exceed 1,000 individuals (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are two Plains Bison conservation herds and two Wood Bison conservation herds each exceeding 1,000 individuals—therefore according to this criteria the total number of viable populations is only four. However, a specific population viability analysis was performed on the eight bison herds functioning as wild and results demonstrate that all are demographically viable but all but the two largest herds will lose 5-8% of their genetic diversity over the next 200 years (see the PVA report in the Supplementary Material).",Stable,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The original North American range <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">for <em>Bison bison</em> extended from northern Mexico to Alaska. Plains Bison (<em>B. b. bison</em>) occurred from Northern Mexico to central Alberta, Canada. Wood Bison (<em>B. b. athabascae</em>) occurred from central Alberta, Canada to Alaska, USA. The species' current range is restricted by land use and wildlife management policies in the southern area and by wildlife and reportable disease management policies in the northern portion of the North American range. Bison functioning as wild currently occupy less than 1.2% of their original range (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""><em> </em>2008, this report).</span></span></p>","<p>Approximately 300,000 bison are commercially propagated on 4,000 farms and ranches in North America (based on data from 2014).

In May 2004 COSEWIC assessed the status of plains bison and recommended listing them as 'Threatened' in Canada. National Refuges and Parks and State parks play an important role in maintaining conservation herds in Canada and the United States. Wild free-ranging herds are managed by government agencies. The Nature Conservancy manages 13 captive herds and the American Prairie Reserve manages one fenced bison herd primarily for conservation objectives. Restoration of large populations of plains bison are being considered in Alberta, southern Colorado, Arizona and northern Montana. The State of Alaska recently reintroduced wood bison to the wild in the Yukon region. Better coordination among various federal initiatives for plains bison conservation is being accomplished by a designated Department of Interior Bison Working Group commissioned by secretarial order in 2008. A Plains Bison reintroduction is scheduled for Banff National Park in spring 2017.<br/> <br/> The Bison Specialist Group (North America) produced a bison conservation assessment and action plan that provides support and guidance for policy development and conservation planning and management for public and private sector projects, including: numeric, geographic and genetic status of North American bison, including public and private herds; a review of legislation and policies of individual range states regarding bison conservation; geographic assessment of priority conservation areas in North America (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010); enhancing the capacity of members of the Bison Specialist Group and organizations they represent to provide timely, innovative and practical solutions to conservation challenges; guidelines for management in support of species’ conservation and ecological restoration. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are potential opportunities for ecological restoration of herds managed primarily for conservation on federal, state, provincial lands in some jurisdictions (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, Freese <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recently the U.S. Department of Interior published a document titled “looking forward” where they enumerated potential restoration sites in the United States (National Park Service 2014a). In addition the U.S. National Park Service has identified bison restoration as a key activity in their plan for the next 100 years.

Where the species has been studied: (1) subpopulation sizes are very small (in the range of 10s to low 100s of individuals) with the single exception of Bangladesh that had a abundance estimated at 5,800 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) = 40%) in 2007; (2) there have been significant range declines in several areas; and (3) threats, especially incidental mortality in fisheries (bycatch) and habitat degradation, are well documented, severe, pervasive, and potentially increasing. The fragmented distribution of the species in coastal waters near river mouths and in deep pools of large rivers means that the species is exposed to intensive anthropogenic threats because human activities are generally concentrated in these areas. Where the species has been studied, including in Bangladesh, stranding records and reports from local fishermen suggest that incidental mortality in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, is not sustainable. Three riverine Irrawaddy Dolphin subpopulations (Mekong, Ayeyarwady, and Mahakam), one in Songkhla Lagoon, and one in Malampaya Sound are listed as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List.<br/><br/>Moore (2015) estimated that the generation time for a pristine population of Irrawaddy Dolphins (i.e., one with a stable age structure and abundance at carrying capacity) is 20 years (range 16-23) and the best estimate of maximum annual rate of increase is 3.8% (range 2-6%). Moore (2015) also estimated that based on these parameters, three generations (i.e., 60 years) of human-induced mortality rates of 4.4%, 5.0%, and 6.5% per year would lead to declines in population size of 30%, 50%, and 80%, respectively, corresponding to IUCN Red List classifications of Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN), and CR, respectively, under criterion A (population size reduction). For example, the deaths of only 4.2 individuals per year from a population of 100 would result in a 50% decline, therefore meeting the criteria for EN (Moore 2015).<br/><br/>The available evidence from studied subpopulations and indications from elsewhere in their range suggest that mortality rates of Irrawaddy Dolphins are consistently at, or above, the rate that would result in a 50% or greater decline in three generations. Examples based on recovered carcasses (see the <em>Threats</em> section below) in the best known Irrawaddy Dolphin subpopulations (all freshwater) indicate a minimum annual mortality of 9.3% for Chilika Lagoon (a mean of 10.3 individuals per year between 2003-2009 in a population estimated at 111 dolphins (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2017); 5.7% for the Mahakam River (4.0 individuals per year between 2005 and 2016 in a population estimated at 70 individuals in 2005 (Kreb <em>et al</em>. 2007, and unpub. data)); 3.2% for the Mekong River (3.0 individuals per year in 2001-2005 in a population estimated at 93 dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2013)); and 4.3% in the Ayeyarwady River (2.8 individuals per year in 2002-2016 in a population estimated at 65 individuals (Lin in Thomas and Gulland 2017)). Although only the estimates for Chilika Lagoon and the Mahakam River surpass the 5.0% human-induced mortality threshold calculated by Moore (2015), these mortality rates reflect only deaths that were documented and reported and there is a high probability of undetected/unreported deaths, especially in remote areas. Actual mortality rates are almost certainly much higher in most areas. Although the aforementioned examples were freshwater subpopulations, which may be more vulnerable than coastal subpopulations, expert opinion and less comprehensive data sets on Irrawaddy Dolphin mortality in coastal waters suggest that other subpopulations are experiencing similarly high levels of human-caused mortality. For instance, a cetacean stranding network in Bangladesh recorded roughly five Irrawaddy deaths per year between 2007 and 2016, despite the network covering only a very small portion of the species’ range in inland and coastal waters. Irrawaddy Dolphins also appear to be the most frequently by-caught cetacean in coastal fisheries in Sarawak (Peter et al. 2016b).<br/><br/>Irrawaddy Dolphin habitat overlaps strongly with severe threats from growing human activities. The primary factor responsible for population declines in both their freshwater and marine habitat is incidental mortality in small-scale fisheries, especially gillnets. Habitat loss and degradation is also a major contributing threat in many freshwater areas, especially from existing and planned dams in the Mekong and Ayeyarwady rivers, and in coastal estuarine habitat from declining freshwater flows, increasing commercial vessel traffic and pollution. Rigorous data on annual mortality needed to distinguish between VU and EN listings (4.4% and 5.0%, respectively) are not available and, with the exception of a few well studied subpopulations, the data are unlikely to become available in the foreseeable future. However, it is probable that the high mortality and small size of the studied populations will be found to apply to those areas where data are currently non-existent or limited. The severity and pervasiveness of the primary threats give reason to suspect that an EN listing is appropriate according to a population size reduction of ≥50% over the past 60 years, future 60 years, and a time period encompassing 60 years in both the past and the future. Considering the strong evidence that fatal entanglements in fishing gear will only increase in the future along with increasing fishing effort from small-scale fisheries; alternative fishing techniques for replacing gillnets while meeting local fishery needs are not available; and dam construction and coastal development in priority Irrawaddy dolphin habitat are increasing in both magnitude and range, the case for a ≥50% reduction in the next 60 years is particularly compelling.<br/><br/>The Irrawaddy Dolphin qualifies as EN A2cd+3cd+4cd. Criteria A2, A3, and A4 refer to a population size reduction of ≥50% over the past 60 years, future 60 years, and a time period encompassing 60 years in both the past and future, respectively; c refers to declines in the area of occupancy and quality of habitat, and d refers to levels of exploitation which in this case is non-deliberate bycatch in fisheries. The EN classification of the species is reinforced by the fact that five subpopulations have been assessed as CR, as well as the ongoing intensity of bycatch and habitat deterioration throughout the species’ range, without any substantial mitigation.","Irrawaddy Dolphins occur in varied habitats. In rivers, they occur almost exclusively in relatively deep (10-50 m) pools located at confluences or above and below rapids. In coastal waters, Irrawaddy Dolphins most commonly occur in areas affected by freshwater inputs and they may enter the lower reaches of rivers (Smith 2017). In the Rajang River in Sarawak, Malaysia, Irrawaddy Dolphins were observed both in the lower reaches of the river and as far as 86 km upriver (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the coastal areas of Sarawak, Irrawaddy Dolphins were statistically more likely to be observed within 6 km of shore, with a mean water depth of 4.2 m (standard deviation (SD) = 2.4) and salinity of 31.2 ± 2.3 ppt with their distribution shifting inshore during high tide and offshore during low tide (Peter<em> et al.</em> 2016a). In Malampaya Sound, Philippines, 76% of sightings occurred in waters shallower than 6 m (Dolar<em> et al.</em> 2002) with a mean salinity of 28.3 ppt (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2004a). In Chilika Lagoon, 75% of 517 dolphin groups occurred in waters 0.6-2.5 m deep, with a maximum depth of 5.2 m for all groups, while salinity ranged from 1-22 ppt (Sutaria 2009). In coastal waters of Bangladesh, sighting locations had a mean depth of 7.5 m (range 2.7-16.0 m) and a mean salinity of 16.1 ppt (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia, Irrawaddy Dolphins occur in slightly deeper (mean 14.6 m; n = 94; SD = 9.3; range = 2-46 m) and higher salinity (mean 26 ppt; n = 35; SD = 3.1; range = 21-33 ppt) waters (D. Kreb pers. comm. 2017). Irrawaddy Dolphins have been observed in the same areas as Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises (<em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) in coastal waters of Bangladesh and Myanmar (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2008, Smith and Tun 2008), and their range overlaps those of both Finless Porpoises and Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>) in coastal areas of Borneo (Kamaruzzan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Irrawaddy Dolphins also co-occur with Ganges River Dolphins (<em>Platanista gangetica</em>) in a relatively small portion of their range in the Sundarbans mangrove forest (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2006). In waterways of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Irrawaddy Dolphin distribution shifts downstream and upstream according to high and low freshwater flow, respectively, and is conditionally dependent (P &lt; 0.05) on low salinity, moderate to high water depths, high temperature and increasing numbers of channel conﬂuences (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><span lang=""EN-GB"">","As mentioned above, the patchy and fragmented distribution of Irrawaddy Dolphins in both coastal waters and rivers renders them particularly vulnerable to threats from human activities concentrated in the same areas. The most severe threat to most subpopulations is incidental mortality from entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets. Habitat loss, particularly from dams in riverine populations, and degradation from declining or altered freshwater flows affecting estuarine populations, is a looming conservation threat with the potential for extirpating subpopulations and further fragmenting the already patchy distribution of the species. Irrawaddy Dolphin habitat in both freshwater and estuarine systems is also being degraded by pollutants (oil, pesticides, industrial wastes, coal dust, etc.), siltation from poor land practices, and in some areas noise (e.g., Kreb <em>et al</em>. 2010, Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016a, Thomas and Gulland 2017). Live captures for aquarium display as well as hunting may have affected some populations in the past. In the Mekong River Basin, Irrawaddy Dolphins were also killed by wartime bombing and by explosives used to catch fish (Baird and Mounsouphom 1994).<br/><br/>Irrawaddy Dolphins are caught accidentally in fishing nets in all areas where they have been studied (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007). The most detailed information on such bycatch comes from the Mekong River where of 15 confirmed human-caused deaths documented between 2001 and 2005, 13 (87%) were due to gillnet entanglement (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fewer carcasses have been recovered since 2008, but six (four adults and two neonates) were recovered in 2016 (Hang in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>In the Mahakam River between 2005 and 2016, an average of four carcasses were recovered every year, of which 16% were calves, 9% juveniles and 75% adults. About two thirds of these deaths were attributed to entanglement in large-mesh (10-17.5 cm) gillnets (Kreb in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>Of 49 Irrawaddy Dolphin deaths recorded in Bangladesh from February 2007 to December 2016, two thirds were judged to be due to entanglement, mostly in gillnets, based on net and rope marks, entangled gear attached to the carcasses, and reports from fishermen (Alom in Thomas and Gulland 2017). Mortality has also been recorded in drift gillnets targeting elasmobranchs in coastal waters of Bangladesh (Smith et al. 2008) and bottom-set gillnets targeting crabs in Malampaya Sound (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004a). Fishermen in some areas report that dolphins are released if found still alive (Smith and Hobbs 2002, Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016b) but in the case of drowned animals, the oil may be used for medicinal purposes or the flesh eaten (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004a).<br/><br/>In Chilika Lagoon, India, 72 dolphin carcasses were found between 2003 and 2009 (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the causes of death were not specified. Between 2002 and 2016, 42 dolphin deaths were recorded in the Ayeyarwady in Myanmar, 29 of these inside the Ayeyarwady Dolphin Protected Area (Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>Interview surveys of 210 fishermen in Bangladesh and 27 fishermen in Sarawak, Malaysia confirmed that gillnets, and occasionally set-bag nets and longlines, are responsible for the majority of dolphin deaths (Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Alom in Thomas and Gulland, 2017). Fishing with electricity has been reported as a threat to the Ayeyarwady subpopulation (Smith and Tun 2007) but details of the dolphin mortality attributed to this destructive fishing practice are unclear.<br/><br/>Dams have degraded some channels inhabited by Irrawaddy Dolphins in the Mekong River Basin and more dams have been proposed in the river’s mainstem (Stone 2016, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017). Four major hydropower projects are of extreme concern to dolphins in the Mekong River: Don Sahong dam, currently under-construction in Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the proposed Sambor, Stung Treng, and Lower Sekong dams in Cambodia. Since construction began on the Don Sahong dam in 2014, the tiny group of dolphins in the transboundary pool between Laos and Cambodia had declined from five to three animals in 2017 and all are now restricted to the Anlung Cheuteal deep pool upstream from the construction site. If built, the other three proposed dams are almost certain to cause further loss of core habitat and fragmentation of the Irrawaddy Dolphin population in the Mekong (Ryan in Thomas and Gulland 2017). In particular, experts believe that construction of the Sambor and Stung Treng dams, to be located in the middle of their core habitat in the Mekong mainstem, would lead to the extinction of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mekong. These dams threaten not only dolphins but also fisheries and therefore human livelihoods (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007). A high dam proposed for the headwaters of the Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar, in Myitsone just below the confluence of the Mali Hka and N’Mai Hka tributaries, provides reason for concern about effects on the population of Irrawaddy Dolphins downstream (<a href=""https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/the-myitsone-dam-on-the-irrawaddy-river-a-briefing-3931"">https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/the-myitsone-dam-on-the-irrawaddy-river-a-briefing-3931</a>).<br/><br/>Deforestation and gold, sand, and gravel mining are causing major changes to the geomorphic and hydraulic features of rivers and marine-appended lakes where Irrawaddy Dolphins occur (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007). Increased sedimentation resulting from deforestation in surrounding watersheds has resulted in declining water depths in Songkhla, Chilika, and Jempang Lakes. The last of these water bodies adjoins the Mahakam River and previously supported dolphins throughout most of its breadth. Now it is no longer suitable habitat for the species (D. Kreb pers. comm). Between 1992 and 1997, the maximum depth of Chilika Lagoon declined from 3.4 to 1.4 meters and the accumulation of sediments led to shrinkage of the opening channel and a dramatic decline in salinity. A new channel dredged in the northern portion of the lake in 2000 is thought to have mitigated at least some of the problems caused by sedimentation (Pattnaik et al., 2007). Maintenance dredging now maintains waterflow in and out of the lake, although the opening of the lake to the sea is continually shifting, followed by shifts in dolphin distribution (D. Sutaria pers comm). The lake is also affected by high levels of heavy metal contamination (Banerjee <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and population fragmentation in several areas have resulted from the proliferation of fixed fishing gear. In the early 2000s, about 27,000 Sai nong or sitting traps and 13,000 Sang sai or barrier traps created more than 8,000 linear kilometres of barrier in multiple rows in the middle and southern portions of Songkhla Lake. These fishing structures were left in place year-round and restricted dolphin movements such that their habitat was substantially reduced and the potential for demographic interaction with dolphins from the Gulf of Thailand was eliminated (Smith et al. 2004b). No new information on the situation in Songkhla Lake has become available but there is no reason to believe it has improved in any way, and the Songkhla Lake subpopulation of Irrawaddy Dolphins is in imminent danger of extirpation.<br/><br/>A 2014 study of six Irrawaddy Dolphin populations in Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India found varying degrees of presence of cutaneous skin nodules, thought to be caused by a fibropapilloma, with the highest prevalence (13.6%) in Chilika Lagoon, where the two most serious cases were observed, and in Kuching, Malaysia. The progression of this disease may be associated with environmental pollutants (Van Bressem <em>et al</em>. 2014), and as such may be an indicator of habitat deterioration in the areas where it is detected.","No range-wide survey has been conducted for this species, nor is there a synoptic estimate of the total number of Irrawaddy Dolphins from local or regional surveys. Statistically rigorous abundance estimates are available for only a few portions of the range. As summarized in Smith (2017) and Thomas and Gulland (2017), listed from largest to smallest, these are: 5,383 (CV = 40%) in open estuarine waters of Bangladesh (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008); 451 (CV = 10%) in waterways of the Sundarbans mangrove forest in Bangladesh (continuous with the estuarine waters in Bangladesh mentioned above; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2006); 423 averaged over five years of line-transect surveys along the Trat coast in the Gulf of Thailand (Hines <em>et al</em>. 2015); 233 (CV = 22.5%, 95% confidence limits (CL) = 151–360) in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, Malaysia (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2013); 189 (CV = 23%, 95% CL = 122-292) for the Bintulu-Similajau coastline in Sarawak (C. Peter and G. Minton, unpub. data through 2015); 111 (CV = 8%) in Chilika Lagoon, India (Sutaria and Marsh 2011); 77 (CV = 8%; 95% CI = 71-84, D. Kreb, unpub. data) in the Mahakam River in 2016; and 58-72 in the Ayeyarwady River (Smith and Tun 2007). In the Mekong River estimates dropped from 93 individuals in 2007 (95% CL = 86–101; Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2013) to 85 in 2010 (95% CL = 78-91; Ryan <em>et al</em>. 2011), to 80 in 2015 (95% CL 64-100; Phan <em>et al</em>. 2015). The most recent estimate for Malampaya Sound in the Philippines decreased from 77 individuals in 2001 (CV = 27%; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004a) to 35 in 2012 (CV = 22.9%; 95% CI = 22-55; Whitty 2016). Additionally, an estimate of minimum abundance of Irrawaddy Dolphins in Koh Kong, Cambodia (contiguous with the population on the Trat coast in Thailand), was 69 individuals (95% CI = 53-85) based on the number of photo-identified individuals (47) corrected by the proportion of unmarked individuals (46.9%; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2016). A population of roughly 50 individuals has been documented in Balikpapan Bay, Kalimantan, Indonesia (D. Kreb, unpub. data).<br/><br/>For each of the five of the subpopulations classified as Critically Endangered (CR), and a sixth subpopulation in Chilika Lake, India, the number of reproductively mature individuals is estimated to be less than 50. Limited research and data from additional locations in Borneo, where other presumably isolated subpopulations have been documented, indicate that in contrast to the larger subpopulation in Bangladesh, most parts of the species’ range where suitable habitat occurs likely host very small local subpopulations, such as those in the Sesayap River and estuary in Kalimantan (estimated at 40-96 individuals with seasonal fluctuation; Kreb unpubl. data) and Cowie Bay in Sabah (estimated at 31 individuals; Woan <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Decreasing,"Irrawaddy Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, and are predominantly associated with freshwater inputs (Stacey and Arnold 1999, Smith 2017). Coastal and estuarine populations occur from Borneo and the central islands of the Indonesian Archipelago north to Palawan, Philippines, and west to the Bay of Bengal, including the Gulf of Thailand. There are also freshwater subpopulations in three large rivers: Ayeyarwady in Myanmar (up to 1,400 km upstream from the river mouth), Mahakam in Indonesia (with a suspected current range between 90 km to 500 km upstream from the river mouth and the area of highest density between 180 and 280 km from the mouth), and Mekong in Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (a range of less than 200 km between Kampi pool, near Kratie, Cambodia, and Khone Falls, Laos, some 690 km from the river mouth). Within the extent of Irrawaddy Dolphin occurrence in these rivers, their area of occupancy is concentrated in deep pools associated with confluences and above and below rapids. Three other subpopulations inhabit marine-appended brackish water bodies: Chilika Lagoon in India, Songkhla Lagoon in Thailand, and Malampaya Sound in the Philippines.<br/><br/>Although the map accompanying this assessment implies a continuous distribution throughout the coastal areas of the species’ range, subpopulations are known to be fragmented and patchily distributed, with long stretches of coastline where the species is now absent, either due to lack of freshwater inputs or likely local extirpation.&#160; For example, while Irrawaddy Dolphins are present in the coastal waters of the Trat Province, Thailand, they appear to be absent in the neighbouring provinces of Chanthaburi and Rayong in the upper Gulf of Thailand (Hines et al. 2015). Similarly, while populations were documented in Kuching Bay and Similajau in Sarawak, Malaysia, the species was not observed during repeated cetacean surveys off the coast of Miri and the Baram River, where the species is known to have been present historically (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pilleri and Gihr 1974).","Hunting or trade is not known to be a major factor explaining population declines of Irrawaddy Dolphins with the exception of Ton Le Sap in Cambodia where intensive hunting by the Khmer Rouge was reported during the 1970s and the species is now extirpated from the lake. Live captures for aquarium display, including export (e.g., to Japan), have taken place in some areas (e.g., Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia) but are not believed to be frequent at present.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The Irrawaddy Dolphin is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as well as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).<br/><br/>The Action Plan for the Conservation of Freshwater Populations of Irrawaddy Dolphins (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007) noted that multiple-use protected areas will play a key role for conserving freshwater subpopulations of Irrawaddy Dolphins. Protected areas could be a particularly effective conservation tool due to the fidelity of the species in freshwater systems to relatively circumscribed areas, as this can facilitate management. The Action Plan also provided details on strategies for mitigating bycatch that included (1) establishing core conservation areas where gillnetting is banned or severely restricted; (2) promoting net attendance rules and providing training on the safe release of entangled dolphins; (3) initiating a program to compensate fishermen for damage caused to their nets by entangled dolphins that are safely released; (4) providing alternative or diversified employment options for gillnet fishermen; (5) encouraging the use of fishing gears that do not harm dolphins by altering or establishing fee structures for fishing permits to make gillnetting more expensive while decreasing the fees for non-destructive gears; and (6) experimenting with acoustical deterrents and reflective nets.<br/><br/>In some countries conservation progress is underway. In Myanmar, the Department of Fisheries is collaborating with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to implement the Management Plan for the Ayeyarwady Dolphin Protected Area (ADPA) (Thomas and Gulland 2017). In the Mekong River, a River Guard Program administered by the local governments in relevant provinces and supported by WWF-Cambodia has stationed 68 River Guards at 16 different outposts along the Mekong from Kratie to the Cambodian-Lao border to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations designed to protect fisheries and dolphins (Samnang in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>In the Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, conservation efforts have focused on training fishermen to rescue dolphins when they are entangled and raising awareness among communities and government authorities. A local non-governmental organization also encourages alternative livelihoods, for example aquaculture and nature-oriented tourism. Since 2002, there have been eight successful releases of dolphins entangled in nets and three dolphins have been rescued from swamp areas when they were unable to return to the main river. The designation of a protected area (24,000 ha core, 51,000 ha total) is currently in progress and will include core dolphin habitat as well as freshwater swamps (Kreb <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kreb in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh three wildlife sanctuaries for freshwater dolphins have been in place since 2012 in the eastern Sundarbans. While primarily designed to protect Ganges River Dolphins rather than Irrawaddy Dolphins, the sanctuaries include areas where both species regularly co-occur. In 2014, the Government of Bangladesh declared a 1,738 km² marine protected area in the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon and adjacent estuarine waters. This includes 233 km² of priority habitat for Irrawaddy Dolphins.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

At the national level, Venezuela showed the greatest projected loss of key patches (70%), with only two of these key patches available to sustain its bear population. Peru, Colombia and Ecuador are projected to lose 31%, 29% and 27% respectively, and Bolivia 19%. Causes of this loss of key patch habitat is associated with human development activities that have not ceased, and in some areas may increase by allowing oil exploration and exploitation within some protected areas. Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms; mining and oil exploitation, conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, have been the main drivers of the loss and degradation of Andean bear habitat (Ataroff and Rada 2000, Palminteri <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2001, Armenteras <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2003, 2011; Rodríguez <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Yerena <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em><span lang=""EN-US"">. 2007, Velez-Liendo 2010, Dávalos <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2011, García-Rangel 2012, Portillo-Quintero <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sánchez-Mercado <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2014). Three main data sources were used to map these human intrusions on Andean Bear habitat: disturbed areas (roads, settlements, agriculture fields, etc.) from Josse <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> (2009), forest cover loss derived from satellite imagery for the period 2000-2013 (Hansen <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2013) and 8 years (2000-2008) of fire activities from MODIS Rapid Response System data sets (<a href=""http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.php"">http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.php</a>) (Velez-Liendo 2010;<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">note: data and imagery were from LANCE FIRMS operated by the NASA/GSFC/Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) with funding provided by NASA/HQ<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">).<br/> <br/> Furthermore, as a consequence of habitat loss, human-bear conflicts are likely to increase resulting in reduced tolerance and escalating bear kills (Goldstein <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2006; Sánchez-Mercado <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, 2014; García-Rangel 2012; Zukowsky and Ormsby 2016). Thus, even where a habitat patch is of sufficient size to maintain a bear population, human-caused mortality is likely to reduce bear density.<br/> <br/> Climate change projections for 2010-2039 by Tovar <em>et al</em>. (2013) indicate that all ecosystems inhabited by Andean Bears will exhibit a degree of loss: 30% loss for Tropical high altitude grasslands, 24% for Tropical dry and moist shrublands, and 18% for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests. Based on the current state of the Andean Bear’s habitat, the fact that many threats causing reduction and degradation of Andean Bear ecosystems have not ceased, and projected patterns of biodiversity shift caused by climate change, the species is vulnerable to widespread future decline.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Andean Bear species’ experts in the Bear Specialist Group considered all of these threats and provided estimates of rates of decline.&#160; Experts estimated rates of decline of &gt;30% for each of the five range countries in the next 30 years and also in a 30-year time window overlapping the present (2000–2030). This qualifies the species for Vulnerable, under criteria A3 and A4. There is also a reasonable likelihood that the global population consists of &lt;10,000 mature adults (given a total population of &lt;20,000 bears), a condition under criteria C1, but since the rate of future population decline is only suspected based on rates of habitat loss or alteration, the nature of the evidence is insufficient (i.e., not directly estimated) to categorize the species under C1.<br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","<p>Andean Bear altitudinal range extends from 200 to 4,750 m above sea level, with an area of occupancy covering approximately 260,000 km²<sup> </sup>along the Tropical Andes. The lower limit is on the Western Peruvian range; the upper limit is within Carrasco National Park in Bolivia (Peyton 1980, 1984, 1999; Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sánchez-Mercado 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Velez-Liendo 2010, García-Rangel 2012, Appleton <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> The species inhabits a great variety of ecosystems along the Tropical Andes including Tropical dry forests, Tropical moist lowland and montane forests; Tropical dry and moist shrublands, and Tropical high altitude shrubland and grasslands (García-Rangel 2012). Seasonal shifts in habitat use due to changes in food availability have been reported (Peyton 1980, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Velez-Liendo 1999, Paisley 2001, Cuesta <em>et al.</em> 2003, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009). Andean bears are mostly found in Tropical moist forests and Tropical high-altitude grasslands (Peyton 1980, 1987a, 1987b, 1999; Velez-Liendo 1999, Cuesta <em>et al</em>. 2003, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado 2008), but it remains unclear whether bears can live entirely in high-altitude grasslands and paramo without access to forested areas (Paisley and Garshelis 2006). In the north coast of Peru, Andean bears inhabit a Tropical dry shrubland (Peyton 1999, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, García-Rangel 2012, Appleton <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Andean bears are omnivorous and have a suite of physical adaptations for this life style (McLellan and Reiner 1994, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004, Christiansen and Wroe 2007, Christiansen 2008). Anatomical skull and dentition adaptations to grind (Christiansen 2008) and a pseudo-thumb (Salesa <em>et al</em>. 2006) to aid in consuming a diet of fibrous, hard vegetative matter. Andean bears also opportunistically prey on mammals, including rabbits and mountain tapirs (Castellanos 2011a), but most notably free-ranging domestic cattle (Goldstein 1990, 2002; Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991; Peyton 1999; Cuesta and Suárez 2001; Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004; Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2006; Christiansen and Wroe 2007; Christiansen 2008; Torres 2008; Figueroa and Stucchi 2009; García-Rangel 2012). Bromeliads and palm trees constitute the most common food items in the diet of Andean Bears across the majority of their range (Peyton 1980, Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Goldstein and Salas 1993, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rivadeneria-Canedo 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2009, García-Rangel 2012). On a seasonal basis, fruits are key food sources for the species as they provide carbohydrates, protein and fat necessary to balance their diet (Peyton 1980, 1984, Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Rivadeneira-Canedo 2001, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/> Andean Bears are excellent climbers and commonly build tree platforms where they rest, feed on fruits and carcasses, as well as guard feeding areas (Peyton 1980, 1984; Goldstein 1990, 1991, 2002; Torres 2008, García-Rangel 2012). Activity patterns are mainly diurnal, but they vary seasonally and between geographic areas (Paisley 2001, Paisley and Garshelis 2006, Castellanos 2011b). As food is available all year-round in most parts of their range, Andean bears do not hibernate (Peyton 1999, Garshelis 2009). Information on reproduction is limited for Andean Bears and has mainly come from captive individuals (Bloxam 1977, Rosenthal 1988, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spady <em>et al</em>. 2007, García-Rangel 2012, Enciso and Guimarães 2013).<br/> <br/> The species is polyestrous, a facultative seasonal breeder and experiences delayed implantation (Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spady <em>et al</em>. 2007). In captivity, females show three to four oestrous cycles during a single breeding season with no seasonal ovarian activity (Enciso and Guimarães 2013). Mating has been recorded in the wild at various times of year but peaking between March and October (Peyton 1980, Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998). Litter size varies from one to four, with twins being most common, and may be related to female weight and hence food abundance (Saporiti 1949, Bloxam 1977, Peyton 1980, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, García-Rangel 2012). Field observations in Bolivia (Velez-Liendo 1999) suggested that births occur two to three months before the peak of the fruit season, perhaps to allow mothers to leave the den with their cubs when fruits are abundant (Peyton 1980, Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998, Velez-Liendo 1999, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010). In captivity, time of birth varies with latitude but births usually occur from February to September (Garshelis 2004, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>","<p>                   </p><p><strong>Habitat Loss</strong><br/> The Tropical Andes has been home to human communities, including the great Inca Empire, for thousands of years and, as a consequence, 90% of Andean ecosystems have been transformed in some way (Young 1998, 2009; Vina and Cavelier 1999; Ataroff and Rada 2000; Myers <em>et al</em>. 2000; Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Armenteras <em>et al</em>. 2011). The expansion of the agricultural frontier, together with inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms, have been the main drivers of the loss of natural ecosystems (Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998, Yerena 1998, Young 1998, Vina and Cavelier 1999, Ataroff and Rada 2000, Armenteras <em>et al</em>. 2011, Portillo-Quintero <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mining and oil exploitation are becoming an increasing menace not only to bears, but to local communities due to land expropriation, loss of habitat connectivity, and contamination of water and soil (Young and León 1999, Bury 2002, Bebbington <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bebbington 2009). Conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, together with guerrilla groups in some parts of the Andes, favours a lawless land-use system that also impacts the quality of Andean Bear habitats and the bear's probability of long-term survival (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dávalos <em>et al.</em> 2011, García-Rangel 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong>Illegal Killing</strong><br/> Illegal killing is an important, but underestimated threat for Andean Bears. Based on a review of the literature, an average of about 180 bears are known to be killed per year across its range—it is suspected that the real number is much higher, and is likely increasing. For example, recent assessments in northern Ecuador showed unprecedented numbers of cattle killed by bears (at least 320 during the period 2009-2014; Zukowski and Ormsby 2016), as more people are turning to dairy cow farming as a livelihood (Jampel 2016). Bears are killed for retaliation against crop or livestock depredations (or protection against future depredations), for cultural or medical beliefs, and for commercial trade (Orejuela and Jorgenson 1999, Peyton 1999, Rumiz and Salazar 1999, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Figueroa 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Lameda 2011, E.D. Rodríguez pers. comm. 2014, M.P. Viteri pers. comm. 2014). Since the number of bears killed is likely underestimated by a wide margin, the effects of such killing on bear populations is hard to assess, but rates of killing are high in some areas. Sanchez-Mercado <em>et al.</em> (2008, 2014) estimated that up to 36% of the bear’s distribution in the Cordillera de Merida in Venezuela was within an “ecological trap”, due to human threats. These authors estimated that the effects of this threat combined with habitat fragmentation could be fostering an extinction probability higher than 50% over the next 50 years across this mountain range. Bears are killed during opportunistic encounters, while sport hunting, or as retaliation after damaging crops, particularly maize, or killing livestock (Goldstein 1991, 2002; Peyton 1999, Poveda 1999, Morales Vargas 2003, Goldstein <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008, Torres 2008).<br/> <br/> <strong>Climate Change</strong><br/> Global projections of effects of climate change show a general tendency towards upslope displacement of the mountain biome, suggesting that the Tropical Andes is among the most vulnerable region to climate change (Malcom <em>et al</em>. 2006, Urrutia and Vuille 2009, Beaumont <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, the heterogeneity of this hotspot shows a more complex response (Tovar <em>et al</em>. 2013) affecting phenological patterns and increasing species vulnerability with predictions of species loss ranging from 20-50% due to range contractions for many taxa (Cuesta-Camacho <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lawler <em>et al</em>. 2009, Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2011, Graham <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen <em>et al.</em> 2011, Velásquez-Tibatá <em>et al.</em> 2013, Richardson <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p> It is likely that all ecosystems associated with Andean Bears will exhibit reductions in their extension. With an increment of +0.74 C in the last century, and a projected increase of 4.3 +/- 0.7 C by 2100 (IPCC 2013), extensive changes in habitat are expected: the Tropical high altitude grasslands is the most fragile ecosystem, with an estimated loss of 30% (Tovar <em>et al.</em> 2013) due to the lack of upslope area for migration. Projected reduction in annual rainfall (IPCC 2013) is likely to affect species highly dependent on humidity such as epiphytic bromeliads (Colwell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Svenning and Condit, 2008, Tewsksbury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Tropical dry and moist shrublands are likely to lose 24% of their area (Tovar <em>et al</em>. 2013), mainly due to a significant variation in the number of dry months (IPCC 2013), while a loss of 18% in area was estimated for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests and Tropical dry forests due to upslope displacements. Furthermore, the extensive (and intensive) land use by human activities in Paramo grasslands, are likely to encroach even further, affecting not only the biodiversity associated to this ecosystem, but also the ecosystem services this biome provides to the region.<br/> <br/> Changes in climate regimes must therefore be considered as a growing threat for Andean Bears, as they are likely to alter habitat quality as well as land-use patterns, and increase the probability of human–bear encounters and conflict (Karanth and Chellam 2009, Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sheridan and Bickford 2011, Mysterud 2013, Ripple <em>et al.</em> 2014). Even more, the areas considered to be most vulnerable to climate change across the Andes are those considered important for Andean bears including: Yanachaga Chemillen National Park (NP) (Peru), Manu NP (Peru), Madidi NP (Bolivia), Apolobamba ANMI (Bolivia), Carrasco NP (Bolivia) and Amboro NP (Bolivia) (Hoffman <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>Expert knowledge, data extrapolations, genetic analysis, mark-recapture, radio tracking and sign surveys, as well as ecological modelling have been used to estimate population sizes and densities of Andean Bears (Peyton 1984, 1999; Yerena 1994; Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998; Cuesta and Suárez 2001; Ruiz-García 2003; Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Viteri 2007; Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2007; Velez-Liendo 2010; Garshelis 2011; García-Rangel 2012). Wild populations are believed to be on decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and illegal killing (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008, Velez-Liendo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010, García-Rangel 2012). National assessments applying different approaches estimated 1,100-1,600 bears in Venezuela (Ruiz-García 2003), 3,000-6,000 in Colombia (Ruiz-García 2003), 1,200-2,000 in Ecuador (Cuesta and Suárez 2001, Viteri 2007), ~5,000 bears in Peru (Peyton 1999), and ~3,000 bears in Bolivia (Velez-Liendo 2010). These rather crude countrywide estimates, yielding a range-wide estimate of 13,000-18,000 bears (5-7 bears/100 km² over its 260,000 km² range), are reasonably consistent with three empirically-derived mark-recapture (re-sight) density estimates of 3-8 bears/100 km² (Viteri 2007, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2007, S. Molina, pers. comm). It should be cautioned, however, that all abundance and density estimates for this species have known biases, so consistency among the estimates is not verification of their accuracy (Garshelis 2011).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Bear is the only extant bear species in South America and is endemic to the Tropical Andes (Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007; Viteri 2007; Viteri and Waits 2009; García-Rangel 2012). The distribution of this species is long (<em>ca</em> 4,600 km) and narrow (<em>ca</em> 200-650 km) in the mountains from Venezuela to Bolivia (Peyton <em>et al.</em> 1998, Yerena 1998, Peyton 1999, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004). From North to South, Andean bears are found in Sierra de Perijá and Cordillera de Mérida in Venezuela; the Occidental, Central, and Oriental Andean mountain ranges of Colombia; both Eastern and Western slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes; across the three Peruvian Andean mountain ranges, including a portion of the North Pacific coastal desert; and in the Eastern slope of the Tropical Andes in Bolivia (García-Rangel 2012). The possible presence of the bear in Panama was reported by Hershkovitz (1957), but recent surveys in the area did not find evidence to support this claim (Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2008). Recently, presence of Andean bears in Northern Argentina has been confirmed by Cosse <em>et al</em>. (2014) through genetics. However, given that these presence points are up to 300 km south (straight line) of the known most-southerly population in Bolivia, they may represent vagrant individuals rather than resident populations.</p>",<p>Some bears are killed for cultural and medical purposes. The extent of commercial trade is unknown but likely limited.</p>,Terrestrial,"<p>                   </p><p>The Andean Bear has been listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN since 1982 and has been included in CITES Appendix I since 1975. A total of 58 protected areas have been established across the Andean Bear distribution, but threats remain within their boundaries with most of these areas being no more than “Paper Parks” lacking adequate budget and staff (Hardner 2008; Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008; Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010; García-Rangel 2011, 2012). Although efforts to establish, maintain and connect old and new protected areas along the bear’s range have been carried out (e.g., Vilcabamba-Amboro corridor between Peru and Bolivia and the interconnected system of protected areas in the Venezuela Andes), large portions of the bear’s habitat are still unprotected and poaching has not been controlled (Yerena 1994, 1998;Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Surkin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Yerena and García-Rangel 2010, Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recently (2007-2014), a number of important steps towards Andean Bear conservation have been undertaken across its distribution including: (1) promotion of Andean Bear conservation by local education programmes and research projects carried out by conservation groups, NGOs, zoological parks, universities, research institutes and government agencies in Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela (Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Albarracín 2010, García-Rangel 2012). (2) The publication of national action plans for Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador (Sánchez-Mercado 2008, Castellanos <em>et al</em>. 2010, Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010), and a national assessment for Bolivia (Velez-Liendo, <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately priority actions highlighted by some of these programs have not been undertaken. Such is the case for the three key areas identified for connectivity conservation within the Venezuelan Action Plan (Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Knowledge regarding the species ecology has improved, with information about home range sizes, movement patterns and population sizes for some locations in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2010, García-Rangel 2012). Nevertheless, in order to develop robust conservation actions, further efforts regarding population sizes and limiting factors are required. Current and future research need to focus on populations, habitat and connectivity, human dimensions, and climate change effects on both the ecology of the species and human-bear conflict               (Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Jorgenson and Sandoval 2005, Yerena <em>et al.</em> 2007, Monsalve Dam <em>et al.</em> 2010, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010, García-Rangel 2012).&#160;Finally, it is important to encourage conservation initiatives to focus on a more holistic and creative approach where the needs of the species and the people inhabiting the Andes mountain range are jointly considered (García-Rangel 2012).</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
123797627,121097935,Pongo abelii,Critically Endangered,A4bcd,2017,2017-10-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to high levels of habitat conversion and fragmentation, and illegal killing, <em>Pongo abelii</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in recent years. Forest loss data indicate that key Sumatran Orangutan forest habitat (i.e., below 500 m asl) was reduced by 60% of its area between 1985 and 2007 (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011). It is thought that this reduction will continue as forests within the species’ range remain under considerable threat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). When relative stability returned to Aceh in 2005 after several years of civil conflict, pressure on natural habitats increased dramatically (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2011). Significant areas of the Orangutan’s range are seriously threatened by logging, mining concessions and agricultural plantations, while new roads are continuously being cut through the habitat. Even in formally protected areas, Orangutans remain under threat from forest conversion to plantations, illegal settlement and encroachment (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2016). Furthermore, an illegal spatial land-use plan being implemented by the Government of Aceh Province ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s status as a 'National Strategic Area', designated for its environmental function.&#160;Moreover, modelling based on different land-use scenarios and their likely impacts predicts that approximately an additional 4,000 Sumatran Orangutans could be lost by 2030 as a direct consequence of this spatial plan and related developments, and that in 2060 there could be a 81% decline of the population compared to the population in 1985 (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016, Nowak unpublished data).&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>Due to their slow life history, with a generation time of at least 25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009), Sumatran Orangutan populations are unable to sustain substantial and continual loss of individuals. If the rate of decline observed since 1985 and predicted continues unabated, the population decline will exceed 80% over a three-generation period (i.e., 75 years from 1985 to 2060), hence qualifying <em>Pongo abelii</em> as Critically Endangered under criterion A4.","Sumatran Orangutans inhabit moist lowland forest, montane forest and peat swamps. They are diurnal and almost exclusively arboreal; females virtually never travel on the ground and adult males do so only rarely. This contrasts somewhat with Bornean Orangutans (especially adult males), which descend and travel on the ground more often (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). While both species depend on high-quality primary forests, Bornean Orangutans appear better able to tolerate limited habitat disturbance (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Sumatra, densities plummet by up to 60%, even if logging is highly selective (see Rao and van Schaik 1997) and Orangutan behavioural ecology differs in primary and logged forests (Hardus <em>et al</em>. 2012a).<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutans are primarily frugivores, but also eat young and mature leaves, seeds, shoots, pith, flowers, insects (termites and ants), bark and, on occasion, the meat of slow loris (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2004, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morrogh-Bernard <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hardus <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Female home ranges vary in size from 0.8–1.5 km². The true extent of male home range size is not fully known, although ranges well in excess of 30 km² are inferred (Singleton and van Schaik 2001, Singleton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Females first give birth at about 15 years of age (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009). Sumatran Orangutans have the longest interbirth intervals of any mammalian species, ranging from 8.2 to 9.3 years (compared with 6.1 to 7.7 years for <em>P. pygmaeus</em>; Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009, van Noordwijk and van Schaik 2005). Gestation lasts approximately 254 days (Kingsley 1981). Infants are weaned at <em>ca </em>7 years. On average, a female bears 4–5 offspring during her lifetime. Males mature at about about 14 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004). They exhibit bimaturism, whereby fully flanged adult males and smaller unflanged males are both capable of reproducing, but employ differing mating strategies (Utami <em>et al</em>. 2002, Utami Atmoko <em>et al</em>. 2009). Longevity in the wild has been estimated at 53 years for females and 58 years for males (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004). Generation length is at least 25 years (Wich <em>et </em>al. 2004, 2009).","The Sumatran Orangutan's survival is seriously threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2016). Forests continue to be cleared at the large and medium scale for oil-palm plantations that can each cover hundreds of square kilometres. On a smaller scale, logging for timber (both legal and illegal) remains a threat, as does the creation of new roads, which fragment populations and gives access to illegal settlements and further encroachment for agriculture and plantations (also frequently illegal), and to wildlife poachers. When industrial plantations are established, the resident orangutans are forced to seek refuge in adjacent forest patches, if any remain, but in the long term they are likely to succumb to malnutrition and starvation due to competition and limited resources. Such forest fragments are often subsequently cleared as well.<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutans are frequently killed deliberately, completely illegally, and surviving infants end up in an illegal pet trade. This trade tends to be a by-product of habitat conversion, for example, if an Orangutan is found in an isolated patch of trees during the conversion process, there is a high probability it will be killed. Sumatran Orangutans are also regularly killed in human-wildlife conflict situations, for example, if raiding fruit crops on farmland at the forest edge&#160;(Wich <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/>  <br/>By far the largest single current threat to the Sumatran Orangutan comes from a spatial land-use plan ratified by the government of Aceh Province in 2013. Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem being obligated by Aceh’s own special autonomy law (Law No 11 2006) due to its designation in 2007/8 as a National Strategic Area for its environmental function (which requires its inclusion and special consideration at all levels of spatial planning). But alarmingly the current Aceh spatial plan completely ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s existence. Both the provincial and national governments have publicly acknowledged the illegality of the Aceh spatial plan, but to date it remains officially ratified at the provincial level and has not been formally cancelled by the national government. As of early 2016, legal challenges are attempting to rectify this situation and to have the current Aceh spatial plan replaced with one that complies fully with all relevant laws, is based on sound environmental sensitivity analyses, and affords appropriate protection to the Leuser Ecosystem in accordance with existing legislation. However, whilst the status quo persists, the Aceh Provincial Spatial Plan of 2013 allows huge tracts of Sumatran Orangutan habitat to be designated for new plantations, and timber and mining concessions, and will lead to many more Sumatran Orangutans being lost in the ensuing years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). The existing plan also effectively legitimizes numerous roads cut illegally through the forest, which further fragment Orangutan populations and provide yet more access to hunting and encroachment.","The most recent population estimate for the Sumatran Orangutan is 13,846 individuals, in a total area of 16,775 km² of forest (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016). Excluding populations of fewer than 250 individuals (i.e., considering only populations that are potentially viable over the long term) leaves just 13,587 individuals. The vast majority (i.e., 95.0%) occur in the Leuser Ecosystem, while other populations are found in the Sidiangkat and Pakpak.&#160;The 2016 estimate is higher than the previous estimate of around 6,600 individuals remaining (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008), as it takes into account three factors: a) orangutans were found in greater numbers at higher altitudes than previously supposed (i.e., up to 1,500 m asl not just to 1,000 m asl), b) they were found to be more widely distributed in selectively-logged forests than previously assumed, and c) orangutans were found in some previously unsurveyed forest patches. The new estimate does not, therefore, reflect a real increase in Sumatran Orangutan numbers. On the contrary, it reflects only much improved survey techniques and coverage, and hence more accurate data. It is extremely important to note, therefore, that overall numbers continue to decline dramatically.<br/><br/>Since Sumatran Orangutans have been found up to 1,500 m asl in many areas, there is probably better connectivity among subpopulations in the mountainous Leuser Ecosystem than was previously considered the case (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008). Nevertheless, recent studies found genetic differentiation between subpopulations that is at least partially due to geographic barriers, such as rivers and high mountain ridges, even within the Leuser Ecosystem (Nater <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In addition to the wild populations, two entirely new Sumatran Orangutan populations are gradually being established via the reintroduction of confiscated illegal pets; one in and around the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park (Jambi and Riau provinces) and one in and around the Jantho Pine Forest Nature Reserve, in the far north of Aceh. To date, more than 260 individuals have been reintroduced. The goal of these efforts is to eventually establish new, genetically-viable, fully-reproducing and self-sustaining wild populations as a safety net against catastrophe elsewhere in the species’ range.<br/><br/>About 35.6% of the Sumatran Orangutan population is in protected areas (World Database Protected Areas recognized areas, i.e. excluding hutan lindung/protection forest; SOCP unpublished data), followed by 40.0% in hutan lindung/protection forest, 3.6% in limited production forest, 11.8% in production forest, and 8.9% in other use forest. Including the whole Leuser Ecosystem, which is on the list of Indonesia’s WDPAs: 98.5% of all Sumatran Orangutans are in PAs (incl. hutan lindung/protection forest) or 95.5% in all WDPA recognized areas (thus excluding hutan lindung/protection forest).",Decreasing,"<em>Pongo abelii</em>&#160;is endemic to the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is restricted to the north of the island, with its southern limit being the Simpang Kanan River and tributaries on the west coast and the Asahan River on the east coast, and its northern limit coinciding primarily with the northern boundary of the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh Province (Wich <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2003, 2008, 2016).<br/><br/>Today the majority of Sumatran Orangutans (82.5%) are found in Aceh Province at the northernmost tip of the island. There are populations in North Sumatra Province but the largest of these, in the southern and eastern regions of the Leuser Ecosystem, straddles the border with Aceh. Despite a few smaller patches of forest south of the Leuser Ecosystem appearing to still host orangutan populations, only one entirely North Sumatran population is considered viable in the long term, namely the Pakpak Barat population (for precise locations, see Wich <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2016).<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutan densities decline with increasing altitude and few, if any, reproducing populations are thought to reside in forests above 1,500 m asl (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016).","It is illegal to capture, injure, kill, own, keep, transport, or trade a Sumatran Orangutan.",Terrestrial,"<em>Pongo abelii</em> is strictly protected by Indonesian National Law No. 5/1990 on the Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystems, under which it is illegal to capture, injure, kill, own, keep, transport, or trade a Sumatran Orangutan. Sumatran Orangutans are also protected by international legislation, and listed on CITES Appendix I.<br/><br/>Protection of large areas of primary forest below 1,500 m asl is needed to secure their long-term future. The species’ major stronghold is the Leuser Ecosystem – an area of 26,000 km² mostly contiguous forest that supports <em>circa</em>&#160;95.0% of the Sumatran Orangutans remaining in the wild. Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem was called for under Indonesian National Law No. 11/2006 concerning Governance in Aceh, and it was inaugurated by Presidential Decree in 1998. Designated a National Strategic Area for its environmental function, the Leuser Ecosystem must be fully recognized and its integrity ensured at all levels of spatial land-use planning. According to these laws, management of the Leuser Ecosystem does not exclude non-forest uses, but stresses the importance of sustainable management with conservation of natural resources as the primary goal.<br/><br/>Within the Leuser Ecosystem is the 9,000 km² Gunung Leuser National Park, also designated a Man and Biosphere Reserve and a part of the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra World Heritage Cluster Site by UNESCO.

Although lacking direct empirical estimates of population trends, country experts from the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group made subjective estimates of rates of population loss over three generations (30 years in the past, a 30-year window overlapping the present, and 30 years into the future) based on dwindling geographic ranges, loss and degradation of habitat, and high levels of exploitation. Weighting each country’s estimate of population change by the country’s areal proportion of the geographic range yielded an overall estimated decline of ~35% for the past 30 years, and ~40% or more for time periods including the future. Thus, this species meets the criterion A threshold for Vulnerable.<br/> <br/> Deforestation rates and reported high volumes of hunting and trade throughout the Sun Bear range form the basis for this assessment. Sun Bears are forest dependent species, and, thus area of forest loss is directly linked with population decline. Southeast Asia, which comprises nearly all of the species global range, has experienced a higher relative rate of forest loss over the past 30 years than any other part of the world (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Dong <em>et al.</em> 2014). Extent of occurrence (EOO) appears to be shrinking, with just a few individuals left in China and Bangladesh, and rapid decline in Vietnam (projected 50–80% decline in the next 30 years). Area of occupancy (AOO) is declining and becoming increasingly fragmented, most noticeably in Borneo and Sumatra. In mainland Southeast Asia, some patches in southern Myanmar, central Thailand, southern Cambodia, and southern Vietnam appear to be completely isolated. Deforestation and degradation is expected to continue into the future. Coupled with this, and the persistent trade in bears and bear parts, sun bear populations are expected to decline even more rapidly in the future.</p>","<p>                   </p><p>Sun Bears are a forest-dependent species, favouring interior mature and/or heterogeneously structured primary forests (Augeri 2005). There are two ecologically distinct categories of tropical forest that comprise their natural range, distinguished by differences in climate, phenology, and floristic composition: seasonal evergreen and deciduous forest in the mainland (north of the Isthmus of Kra) and aseasonal evergreen rainforest in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo.<br/> <br/> In the far northern range limit in northeast India, Sun Bears were recorded in mountainous areas of subtropical climate (Higgins 1932, Chauhan and Singh 2006, Choudhury 2011). Their range may be limited farther north by colder climate and unsuitable habitat in the Himalayan sub-region, and limited farther northwest by competition with Sloth Bears (<em>Melursus ursinus</em>; Steinmetz, 2011). In Bangladesh, Northeast India, and throughout the rest of the mainland range (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam) Sun Bears are sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears, inhabiting seasonal ecosystems with a long dry season (3-7 months), during which rainfall is &lt;100 mm per month. Seasonal forest types usually occur in a mosaic that includes semi-evergreen, mixed deciduous, dry dipterocarp, and montane evergreen forest (Nguyen Xuan Dang 2006, Scotson 2010, Steinmetz 2011, Gray and Phan 2011). In Thailand, Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears use many of the same habitats and have extensive overlap in diet.&#160; However, in montane forests &gt;1,200 m elevation (where ground cover is sparse) Asiatic Black Bears are more abundant than sun bears, possibly due to the lower abundance of invertebrate prey (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> In southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, Sun Bears inhabit tropical evergreen moist forest and lowland or hill dipterocarp forest (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Nazeri <em>et al</em>. 2014). Tropical evergreen rainforest comprises the Sun Bear’s main habitat in Borneo, Sumatra, and Peninsular Malaysia. Climate is generally constant in this region, with high annual rainfall that is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. The Sundaic tropical evergreen rainforest includes a wide diversity of forest types used by sun bears, including lowland and hill dipterocarp, peat swamp, freshwater swamp, limestone/karst hills and lower to sub-montane forest.<strong> </strong>Of these habitats,<strong> </strong>in Borneo and Sumatra, sun bear abundance (based on signs and camera trap records) was highest in primary lowland dipterocarp forest (Davies and Payne 1982, McConkey and Galetti 1999, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002, Fredriksson 2005, Augeri 2005, Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2007, Wong and Linkie 2013). Sun Bears also occur in mangrove forest, although their occurrence in this forest type probably depends on proximity to other more favoured habitats (G. Fredriksson, pers. obs).<br/> <br/> Broadly speaking, Sun Bears seem to be more abundant in lower elevations (Augeri 2005, Steinmetz 2011) but there is wide variation throughout the range. In India, Sun Bears were detected up to 3,000 m (Choudhury 2011) and occupancy was higher in high elevations, possibly because low elevations were more degraded (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2009). In western Thailand, Sun Bears occurred primarily below 1,200 m (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al</em>. 2006) but have been observed up to 2,100 m in neighbouring Myanmar (Htun 2006), and up to 1,600 m in Lao PDR (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 1999). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">In Indonesia, sun bears occur primarily below 1,200 m although have been observed at 2,140 m in Sumatra (Augeri 2005, Wong and Linkie 2012). In Peninsular Malaysia Sun Bears were primarily below 1,200 m (Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2014), whereas in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) Sun Bears were more frequently encountered at higher altitudes, though this might be the result of high levels of hunting and logging activities at lower altitudes, both having negative impacts on Sun Bear densities (Brodie <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> In highly disturbed landscapes, habitat use may be driven more by hunting and habitat disturbance levels than by natural influences.<strong> </strong>For example,<strong> </strong>in the World Heritage Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai forest complex in Thailand, illegal rosewood (<em>Dalbergia </em>spp.) logging may cause Sun Bears to avoid interior forest, due to intensive logger traffic, most of whom are armed with guns (D. Ngoprasert, King Mongkut's University of Technology, pers. comm.). In some sites Sun Bears seem to prefer interior primary forest and density increases with increasing distance to roads and human settlements (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2007, Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Wong and Linkie 2013). However, sun bears also use selectively logged areas (Wong <em>et al</em>. 2004, Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2007), but their occurrence in newly logged forest (&lt;10 years) is much lower compared to forest that was logged more distantly in the past (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> Sun Bears have been observed in plantations (oil palm, sugar palm), agricultural lands (sweetcorn, cucumber, pumpkin, sesame), orchards (coconut, durian, banana, jackfruit, snakefruit, pineapple, apple) and near forest edges (Nomura <em>et al.</em> 2004, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson 2005, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2012, Chea 2013, Sethy and Chauhan, 2013, Scotson <em>et al</em>. 2014), where they may be considered pests. Scattered reports of predation on livestock (goats; Sumatra, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2015) and chickens (Borneo, Fredriksson 2005) exist. Crop raiding tends to occur most often during harvest time and is concentrated in areas where crops are planted along the forest edge (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1996, Fredriksson 2005, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is no evidence that Sun Bears can survive in deforested or agricultural areas in the absence of nearby forest (Augeri 2005). It is known that they can derive some nutritional benefit from consuming oil palm fruits (Nomura <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chea 2013), but it is doubtful that they could subsist on this, without other foods and cover provided by nearby natural forest.<br/> <br/> Sun Bears are generalist omnivores, feeding primarily on termites, ants, beetle larvae, stingless bee larvae and honey, and a large variety of fruit species. Figs (<em>Ficus</em> spp.) are particularly important when available (McConkey and Galetti 1999, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Occasionally, growth shoots of certain palms and some species of flowers are consumed (Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a), but otherwise vegetative matter rarely occurs in the diet. The Indonesian name for Sun Bears translates to ‘honey bear’ presumably because they are so attracted to honey. Their massive jaw muscles and disproportionately large canines (for the size of their head; Christiansen 2007, 2008) enable them to bite through the bark/stem of hardwood trees to consume stingless bees nests and honey, and their long tongues are used to extract insects and their products from crevices. Their long sharp claws enable them to dig easily into the ground and break into rotting logs (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Bornean lowland forests, fruits of the families Moraceae, Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet (Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a), whereas in western Thailand fruits of Lauraceae, Fagaceae, Leguminosae, Labiatae, and Sapindaceae are the most commonly consumed (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> There is no evidence of Sun Bears hibernating, presumably because of year-round food availability across their range. There is also no evidence of parturient females entering a prolonged period of fasting, as do other bears species. Female bears use cavities of either standing or fallen large hollow trees as birthing sites. Both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour has been documented. Average home range estimates from Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia range from 7 km² to 27 km², respectively, with daily movements affected by food availability (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fredriksson 2012, Cheah 2013).<br/> <br/> Little is known about social structure or reproduction. Sun Bears are largely solitary, except when with offspring. But they occasionally occur in pairs, and may congregate to feed from large fruiting trees. Faecal steroids from wild Sun Bears in Indonesia and from captive Sun Bears in European and American zoos indicated that Sun Bears are polyestrous, a seasonal breeders, usually producing a single cub (Schwarzenberger <em>et al.</em> 2004, Frederick <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>","<p>Sun Bears are threatened primarily by deforestation and commercial hunting, which occurs to varying degrees throughout the range (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012, Stibig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Killing due to human-bear conflicts is an additional threat, although less obvious in its impact.<br/> <br/> Active trade in wild Sun Bears and their parts (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014) is one of the two most serious threats to Sun Bear populations. Commercial poaching of Sun Bears was reported by regional experts in the Bear Specialist Group to be a moderate to major threat in all range countries except Brunei, for which there are no data (see also Meijaard 1999, Nea and Nong 2006, Nguyen 2006, Htun 2006, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). In Thailand, local hunters in one area estimated that commercial poaching reduced the abundance of Sun Bears by more than 40% in 20 years (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2006). Poaching pressure is increasing within some Thai Protected Areas, based on encounter rates of poaching signs and poachers (Steinmetz and Ngoprasert, unpubl. data), though bears are not usually targeted as much as other species. In northeastern India, where Sun Bear populations occur naturally at low densities, bears are still caught and poaching is said to have reached ""critical"" levels (Chauhan and Singh 2006, Sethy and Chauhan 2012). In southern Lao PDR, sign surveys indicate that Sun Bear populations have been reduced to extremely low levels relative to other sites in Southeast Asia, with declines attributed to historically high poaching levels (Scotson 2012).<br/> <br/> Of major concern is a widespread trend of wildlife snaring throughout much of the Sun Bear range. In northeastern Lao PDR, hunters use a snaring method that specifically targets bears and threatens to wipe out local populations (Scotson and Hunt 2012). Large and small mammal snares were detected in numerous protected areas throughout the county. Although not always specifically targeting bears this represents a major ongoing threat (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013). Farmers affected by wildlife crop damage frequently set snares around the perimeter of crop fields (Fredriksson 2005), and in some instances catch bears (Hunt and Scotson 2011, Scotson <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia camera traps increasingly record bears with missing paws (apparent snare injuries) and in a radio collaring study in Peninsular Malaysia, three out of five captured Sun Bears had missing paws (Cheah 2013), indicating high snaring pressure using cable snares.<br/> <br/> Enforcement of domestic and international wildlife laws is severely lacking in most cases and is failing to deter illegal bear trade (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley <em>et al</em>. 2011, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Low risk of being prosecuted and high potential profits mean that the incentive to poach bears is very high. The value of bear parts on the illegal wildlife market has increased notably over the past two decades (Livingstone and Shepherd 2014).<br/> <br/> Other motivations for killing bears include preventing damage to crops and livestock (Fredriksson 2005, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wong <em>et al</em>. 2014), subsistence use such as wild meat consumption (Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014), and fear of bears near villages. The rapid loss and fragmentation of forests across the Sun Bear range may bring bears closer to humans and thus increase the likelihood of human-bear interactions (Fredriksson 2005). In Lao PDR, where bear crop raiding occurs annually in many parts of the country, farmers showed a general reluctance to report crop raiding events to management authorities and may be more inclined to hunt bears that enter fields instead of seeking non-lethal mitigation methods (Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Incidences of sun bears attacking humans are rare and usually result as an act of self defence—under normal circumstances, Sun Bears avoid humans.<br/> <br/> As Sun Bears are a forest dependent species, population declines are likely to be associated with deforestation rates. Deforestation increased dramatically during 1990-2005 and in recent times Southeast Asia has experienced the highest annual rate of forest cover change in the world&#160; (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Dong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Some estimates project extremely high loss of natural forests and of biodiversity of up to 75% and 85% respectively by 2100 (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010). Rate of forest loss is not uniform throughout the range, however, with some discrepancies among published estimates of forest lost due to varying analytical techniques (Dong <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Analyses by Stibig <em>et al</em>. (2014) indicated that Southeast Asia lost 11.9% of its forest cover during 1990-2000. The Sundaic region (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei) experienced the highest rate of loss (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono 2012, 2014; Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2014); Stibig <em>et al</em>. (2014) calculated 13% of forest was lost during 1990-2000, and Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011 estimated a further 9.9% lost during 2000-2010. By 2012, primary forest loss in Indonesia was estimated to be double that in Brazil (Margono 2014). Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated that in Sumatra and Kalimantan combined, 23.5% of total forest was lost from 1990-2005, with loss of lowland forest alone more than 40%. Brunei seems to be impacted the least, although deforestation and forest degradation are still evident (Bryan <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Deforestation in the Sundaic region is largely attributed to extensive clear-cutting for plantations (i.e., oil palm, rubber), unsustainable logging practices (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2005), legal and illegal logging, and forest fires (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Wong and Linkie 2012). Conversion of natural habitat to oil palm plantations is most extensive on Borneo and Sumatra (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Wicke <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000-2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (i.e. national parks and protected forests, Margano <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in Kalimantan alone, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985-2001 (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Human-caused fires throughout the Sundaic region are also diminishing habitat quality and quantity for sun bears, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia. These fires are more extensive during El Niño-related droughts. Between 1997-2006 a total of 16.2 million ha of Borneo’s landmass (21% of total land surface area) were affected by fires (Langner and Siegert 2009). On Borneo, periods of prolonged drought have disrupted fruiting patterns (e.g., Harrison 2000), which in combination with reduced habitat availability due to clearing for agriculture, logging and fires, resulted in starvation among sun bears, even in protected primary forest areas (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2005, Fredriksson <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Given the Sun Bear’s affinity for primary and relatively mature, heterogeneously structured forests, along with its strongly frugivorous diet, such forest loss and fragmentation will exert significant effects on the bear’s regional and global populations along with its genetic and demographic structure and viability (Augeri 2005). Based on deforestation rates and increasingly fragmented range, and evidence of increasing trade of bears and their parts, it is likely that many isolated populations face a real threat of extirpation.</p>","Regional experts reported declines of Sun Bears in eight of ten current range countries (trends in two other current range countries—Brunei and Bangladesh—are unknown). There are few reliable estimates of Sun Bear population size and few studies have quantified population trends. Previous attempts to extrapolate population size from anecdotal information on bear density derived from occasional bear sightings and sign surveys (e.g., Davies and Payne 1981, Meijaard 2001) have led to unreliable estimates (Garshelis 2002).<br/><br/>A camera-based mark-recapture survey in Thailand estimated population densities of 4.3 (95% Cl 1.6-11.6) and 5.9 (95% Cl 2.3-15.4) per 100 km² in two sites within Khao Yai National Park (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2012). In southern Sumatra, in Harapan Rainforest, a camera-based study estimated a density of Sun Bears of 26 bears per 100 km², 4-5 times higher than density estimates from Thailand (Lee 2014, unpubl. data). The methods used to estimate density in Thailand and Sumatra differed (capture-recapture and gas-model, respectively), but if results are comparable, they suggest substantially higher density of Sun Bears in the Sundaic portion of their range than on the mainland (where in part they coexist and potentially compete with Asiatic Black Bears).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Sun Bears have declined in some sites, for example Khao Yai National Park where camera trap photo encounter rates declined by nearly two-thirds from 0.73 per 100 days (over the period 1999-2003) to 0.27 (2003-2007) (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2003, Jenks <em>et al.</em> 2011). But other populations seem to be doing better, with photo encounter rates stable in Kuiburi Natonal Park and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Steinmetz, unpublished data). An earlier systematic mammal status assessment study with local people in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, estimated that Sun Bear numbers declined by more than 40% in a 20-year period from 1984-2004 (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2006). But improved protection and community engagement since then appears to have had a positive effect. In neighbouring Lao PDR, interviews in rural communities adjacent to bear habitat recorded widespread population declines (Scotson 2010, 2012). In west Sumatra, repeat camera trap surveys using an occupancy-based sampling framework revealed a decline in Sun Bear populations (5%/year) in response to high levels of deforestation (9%/year in the most deforested site) over 7-year period (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Sun Bear populations can recover in previously extirpated areas, given a nearby source population. In Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan), sign transects were used to monitor relative abundance of Sun Bears in forest affected by fires and adjacent unburned forest from 2000 to 2010. In the unburned forest, Sun Bear density remained stable. In the recently burned forest, Sun Bear sign density was close to zero post fires, but in 10 years reached 65% of the sign densities in adjacent unburned forest (Fredriksson 2012).",Decreasing,"The historic range of this species (within 500 years) extended across much of Southeast Asia, from Borneo and Sumatra north to at least Yunnan Province, China. Fossil records from the Pleistocene have been found much farther north (Erdbrink 1953). Assam, in northeast India, marks the northwestern confirmed historic range limit (Wroughton 1916, Higgins 1932). Reports of Sun Bears formerly occupying the Terai of Nepal (Hodgson 1844) appear to be erroneous. In the northeast, the range extends to northeastern Vietnam (Erdbrink 1953). The southern-most range limit is Indonesia; there are no records of Sun Bears ever occurring farther east than Borneo. Records exist from the Island of Java from middle-late Pleistocene (Erdbrink 1953) but there is no evidence of occurrence there within historic times.<br/><br/>In present day, Sun Bears occur patchily through much of the former range, and have been locally extirpated from many areas. This is particularly evident in Thailand, where bears are mainly limited to a patchwork of protected areas separated by expanses of agriculture (Kanchanasakha <em>et al.</em> 2010). The range extends westward to southern Bangladesh and northeastern India (West Garo Hills, Meghalaya), northwards to eastern Arunachal Pradesh (Chauhan 2006; Choudhury 2011; Sethy and Chauhan 2012, 2013) and northern Myanmar. The Sun Bear's range is sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears (<em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) across mainland Southeast Asia to about 9°N latitude (in peninsular Thailand), south of which Asiatic Black Bears do not occur. In the Sundaic region, its range extends south and eastwards to Sumatra and Borneo respectively (Steinmetz 2011).<br/><br/>In mainland Southeast Asia Sun Bears appear to exhibit a natural population gradient from the north to south being most abundant in the southern regions and becoming less common towards the northern edge of their range (Steinmetz 2011). A north to south gradient probably applies to the entire range as well, with population abundance lower in mainland Southeast Asia than in Sundaic Southeast Asia. This is based on higher population densities (Ngoprasert <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lee 2014 unpubl. data) and higher sign densities (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fredriksson 2012) in the Sundaic region compared to the mainland. This gradient of abundance is presumed to be natural and unrelated to human exploitation as it was apparent in historical times (e.g., in India, Higgins 1932) and is also reflected by the relative frequency of fossil records in the mainland and Sundaic regions (Vos and Long 1993, Tougard 2001, Meijaard 2004). As such, Sun Bears are rare in the western and northern edges of their range in southern Bangladesh and Northeast India. There are no records of Sun Bears north of the Brahmaputra River in Assam or Arunachal Pradesh (Chauhan 2006, Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013, Choudhury 2011). Sun Bears are relatively less common in the northern highlands of Lao Peoples&#160;Democratic Republic (hereafter Lao PDR), compared with the southern region (Scotson 2010, 2012). Current distribution in northeastern Myanmar is uncertain due to political instability in the area but presumes to be in decline (Saw Htun, Wildlife Conservation Society, pers. comm. 2014). The northeastern range ends in eastern Vietnam, at the Red River, limited presumably by colder climates and unfavourable habitats.<br/><br/>Sun Bears were thought to be extirpated in Bangladesh until recent confirmed records in 2014 and 2015 (Anwarul Islam, WildTeam pers. comm. 2015). It is possible that a population in a southern Bangladesh is maintained through immigration from core areas in western Myanmar.&#160;Likewise, the existence of this species in China remains in doubt.&#160;Surveys in the most likely regions (remnant lowland natural forests) of Yunnan Province confirmed their absence in all but one small area (&lt;600 km²) that could not be surveyed (Wen and Wang 2013). In 2016, video footage of a Sun Bear was obtained from a camera trap in this area, indicating the presence of at least one bear, &lt;1 km from the Myanmar border (Li <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; It is unknown whether there is a transboundary population, or just a few individuals living near the border. Nevertheless, this represents the first confirmed record of the species in China in 45 years. Sun Bears most likely occurred in what is now Singapore, but were extirpated due to the widespread deforestation that occurred in the 1800s and 1900s (Corlett 1992, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2003).","<p>Sun Bears are commonly poached for their gall bladders (i.e., bile) and paws; the former is used as a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the latter as an expensive delicacy. Traditionally, bear bile was used to treat a wide range of ailments and for promoting general good health and strength. Use was largely subsistence based, until around the mid 1900s, when international trade routes opened and commercial interest in bear bile began to grow. Bear bile forms a component of traditional Chinese medicine but has not commonly been part of traditional medicinal practices in Southeast Asian cultures. Thus, it is not typically used locally, but rather sold to consuming markets. Sun bears (or parts thereof) were one of the most commonly seized bear species in Asia from 2000-2011 (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Illegal import of Sun Bears or parts has been detected in the USA, New Zealand, UK and France, and illegal exportation from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Lao PDR, Indonesia and the USA (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Domestic hunting and trade of Sun Bears is illegal throughout the entire range except Sarawak, where it is permitted under license (although no license has ever been issued; Krishnasamy and Shepherd, 2014). Sun bears have been listed in Appendix I of CITES since 1979 and international commercial trade is therefore illegal. Monitoring illegal bear trade in Asia has been difficult and little quantitative information has been collected on the scale of trade or trends over time. However, records of perceived high volume of use and trade have existed for decades (e.g., Caldecott 1988, Meijaard 1999, Pereira 2002, Foley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), and the high and increasing value of parts indicate that trade is still booming. In Lao PDR, trading values for wild cubs increased 2.6 times and gall bladder values increased 180 times from the early 1990s to 2013 (data for Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears combined; Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Prices vary widely throughout the range. In Lao PDR, in 2014, poachers sold cubs for ~$US 600 and gall bladders ~US$ 700. In Southern Yunnan, in 2014, a Sun Bear carcass from Myanmar, with gall bladder intact, was traded for ~US$ 4,000 (Roshan Guharajan pers. comm. 2015). In Japan and South Korea, values for gallbladders can exceed the value of gold (INTERPOL 2014). In Cambodia, annual confiscation rates of sun bears more than doubled from 1998 to 2008, with a ratio of around 3:1 Sun Bears to Asiatic Black Bears confiscated. Sun Bear confiscations decreased in subsequent years, although given the prevalent high value of bears this may be due to declining bear populations and trade becoming more secretive, as opposed to reduced trade (Broadis 2011). <br/> <br/> Sun Bear cubs (wild caught), although mostly traded as pets, are also ‘farmed’ for their bile in commercial bear farms in China, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam. However, this industry is by far dominated by Asiatic Black Bears and the proportion of Sun Bears held on farms is relatively small (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Indeed, Sun Bears seem to produce much lower levels of the medicinal bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid) than found in Asiatic Black Bears (Hagey <em>et al.</em> 1993). Nevertheless, Sun Bears were observed in small private bile farm enterprises in Vietnam (Nguyen 2006, Foley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Proponents of the bear farming industry claim that the availability of farmed bile will satisfy the growing demand for bear bile and gall bladders within Southeast and East Asian (China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East) markets. However, there is no evidence that this is the case; instead, there is evidence for the opposite - that the demand for wild products continues to rise in the presence of bear farming (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Furthermore, mortality rates of farmed bears are high and farms in Southeast Asia rely on wild cubs to replenish their stock. There may be complex interactions between the markets for farmed and wild sourced bear bile, and the availability of farmed bile may drive up the value and demand for the wild product (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2011). As such, the IUCN has called for a situation analysis to investigate the true nature of the relationship between the market for farmed bile and the market for wild bile (Garshelis and Scotson 2012).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Measures to reduce habitat loss and poaching throughout the entire Sun Bear range are key actions needed to conserve Sun Bears. In areas with the highest deforestation rates, such as Indonesia and Malaysia (two globally leading oil palm producers), immediate action should be taken to protect remaining high conservation value forests from conversion to other land-uses, eliminate unsustainable logging, and effectively manage forest fires. Additionally, new protected areas should be established and effectively managed in order to preempt land conversion (Augeri 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006) and protect critical Sun Bear habitat. For example, in Peninsular Malaysia, Nazeri <em>et al</em>. (2012), using MaxEnt modelling, reported that Sun Bears favour dense tropical evergreen forest over cultivated landscapes and areas in close proximity to roads. Of habitat deemed ‘highly suitable’ only 22% is contained within protected areas. These findings suggest that the present geographical extent of protected areas in Peninsular Malaysia provide insufficient coverage of habitat crucial for conserving Sun Bears.<br/> <br/> In conjunction with primary forest protection, degraded habitats and forest remnants in human-modified landscapes should be enhanced, through reforestation programs, corridor planning and elevated protected status. Additionally, there is the need to establish buffer zones and prevent further agricultural expansion surrounding protected areas. Achieving these measures requires increased levels of resources, the support of conservation constituencies in civil society, and strengthened government commitments to conservation. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the two main producers of palm oil, it will be difficult to stop forest conversion, given the impacts of their economies in the world markets. Furthermore, in present conditions the effective management of already established protected areas, let alone addition of new protected areas and land management outside of protected areas, has proven a highly challenging task.<br/> <br/> Sun Bears are legally protected domestically and internationally from hunting and trade throughout most of their range. However, deficiencies in law enforcement are recognized as major ongoing weaknesses (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Some successes are evident where dedicated agencies operate with steady technical and funding support. For example, in Cambodia, a dedicated Wildlife Protection Mobile Unit, run by Forestry Officials and Military and funded by international NGOs, has confiscated more than 100 Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears since 1998 (Broadis 2011). Similar initiatives exist in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia but action is limited. Establishment of more focused wildlife protection/crime units is recommended for other range countries, where possible funded by local authorities responsible for wildlife law enforcement.<br/> <br/> Reduction of mortality by clearing of snares from bear habitat is urgently needed throughout much of the range, and long term measures are needed to prevent the problem reoccurring. Efforts to do so are underway in several protected areas throughout the region, by park authorities often in collaboration with foreign NGOs. However, these projects usually do not extend throughout a protected area and can face difficulties in maintaining long-term funding and political support.<br/> <br/> To combat the growing impacts of human-bear conflict, funding and technical support is needed to promote non-lethal mitigation, especially in low-income regions where the incentive to hunt bears may outweigh incentives to stop conflict from occurring.<br/> <br/> Non-government organizations (NGO’s) have established bear dedicated rescue centres in Cambodia, Vietnam, Lao, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia with the primary aim of providing sanctuary to bears confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade. Bear rescue centres can play a key role in raising local awareness on the threats to sun bears and the conservation value of ecological services provided by bear habitat. Some centres operate dedicated outreach teams, providing structured learning programs that can reach tens of thousands of people each year. Likewise, centres support capacity building of local conservationists, and facilitate <em>in-situ</em> and <em>ex-situ</em> research and conservation. Rehabilitation of ex-captive Sun Bears is another potential role. However this is rare and fraught with challenges, as most potential release sites are still threatened by forest loss and poaching. For example, in Cambodia, a pilot project to rehabilitate two Sun Bears that had been confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade ended after both bears were trapped in snares within two months, despite over two years of intensive snare-patrolling in the area prior to the release (M. Hunt, Free the Bears, pers. comm).<br/> <br/> Ultimately, reducing the trade in bear parts would be one of the most highly beneficial steps for the persistence and recovery of Sun Bears throughout their range, especially as trade is increasingly moving towards the last strongholds for Sun Bears in Malaysia and Indonesia (Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). Understanding consumer motivation, and educating and changing the behaviour of potential consumers of bear products, could be an incredibly effective tool. This is especially important given that law enforcement is generally underfunded and unfocused.<br/> <br/>Increasing our scientific knowledge of Sun Bear ecology, population distribution, status and effects of threats is also needed. Aside from a now outdated global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), only one range country (India) has developed a National Conservation Action Plan for Sun Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). Range mapping efforts, ongoing since 2006, have suffered from lack of presence data. But in 2014, the Bear Specialist Group mapped the current range-wide distribution of Sun Bears based on collation of more than 2000 presence points from throughout the range and with input from numerous experts. This has resulted in the most up to date range map for the species. The veracity of Probable range depicted by experts remains unclear. Habitat modelling approaches (e.g., Maxent; Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2012) generate maps of potential distribution and may thereby help direct field surveys to promising locations to ascertain bear status; however such models are often generated with bear presence data from a small area and extrapolated broadly, and should thus be treated with caution. There remain large areas for which sun bear status is uncertain, most noticeably in Myanmar, where further research is needed.<br/> <br/> Furthermore, it is important to establish the geographic distribution of Sun Bears at finer scales, taking into consideration habitat and fragmentation within and between countries, in order to better direct conservation actions and monitor habitat changes accurately (i.e., forest loss and fragmentation).<br/> <br/> In 2006 The Bear Specialist Group mapped important habitat blocks for long-term survival of Sun Bears (Bear Conservation Units-BCUs). Anti-poaching efforts and forest boundary protection efforts within BCUs should be a high priority. Presently no BCUs receive support just for bears, but BCUs in some countries coincide with protected areas that receive substantial conservation support for other species (such as tigers), and bears benefit as a result (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2014). The possibilities to link bear conservation with that of other species should be explored and promoted more widely.<br/> <br/> Efforts are currently underway to develop a standard methodology with which to monitor occurrence, relative abundance and trends of Asian bear populations through repeat sign transects. To this end, methodologies to distinguish Sun Bear claw marks from Asiatic Black Bear claw marks and to age claw marks have been developed (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2008, 2010). Surveys using this technique have been completed in Lao PDR and are planned for Vietnam and Cambodia. Trends in bear occurrence and relative abundance within the aforementioned BCUs should be monitored using standardized sign surveys and camera trapping by local government, communities, and NGOs. Results of such monitoring could indicate which management or ecological conditions promote successful bear conservation, and which do not, and provide a means to assess the results of conservation efforts (e.g., future range expansion and/or increased bear density being indicative of effective conservation efforts). Additional field studies would also be helpful in this regard, as few intensive studies have been conducted on Sun Bears.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
123809220,17975,Pongo pygmaeus,Critically Endangered,A4abcd,2016,2016-02-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Bornean Orangutans are lowland forest specialists, rarely found above 500 m asl. In the 1950s, the habitat suitable for orangutans extended across ~255,000&#160;km²&#160;of the island of Borneo (see below).<br/><br/>The two major reasons why most Bornean Orangutans populations are in sharp decline are (1) destruction, degradation and fragmentation of their habitats, and (2) hunting. Recurrent forest fires, especially in peat forests, cause additional sharp declines about once every decade. Bornean Orangutans decreased by more than 60% between 1950 and 2010, and a further 22% decline is projected to occur between 2010 and 2025 (see below). Combined, this equates to a loss of more than 82% over 75 years, 1950–2025. Given that a Bornean Orangutan's generation length is ~25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2009), this decline will occur in a period of three generations. Each of the <em>Pongo pygmaeus</em> subspecies is roughly equally affected. Only one comprehensive quantitative survey of Bornean Orangutans has been conducted, in 2010, which prohibits quantitative assessment of changes in numbers for most populations. Temporal changes in population status are therefore best assessed via the proxies of habitat loss and hunting rates. A detailed rationale for a population decline of more than 86% between 1950 and 2025 follows.<br/><br/>The most accurate estimate of the geographic range of Bornean Orangutans showed that in 2010, 59.6% of the forest remaining in Borneo was suitable habitat (155,106&#160;km²&#160;of 260,109&#160;km²&#160;of forest: Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012, Gaveau <em>et al.</em> 2014). Considering that in 1973, 75.7% of Borneo (424,753&#160;km²) was under natural forest (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014), we estimate that 253,153&#160;km²&#160;of forest was orangutan habitat at this time.<br/><br/>Mechanized logging in Borneo started in the early 1950s, and industrial logging and forest conversion intensified in the late 1960s. The rate of forest conversion is difficult to estimate prior to 1973 due to the lack of satellite imagery, but a recent spatial analysis evaluated forest persistence, clearance and logging spanning the 37 years between 1973 and 2010 (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). We take the rate of forest loss documented from 1973 to 2010 as conservative and <em>de facto</em> lower than if data were available from 1950.<br/><br/><strong>1. Habitat loss and orangutan decline<br/></strong>During the period 1973–2010, 39% of Bornean forests were lost (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014), representing a net loss of 98,730&#160;km²&#160;of prime orangutan habitat. It is estimated that a further 37% of suitable orangutan habitat (155,106&#160;km²) will be converted to plantations between 2010 and 2025, which accounts for the loss of an additional 57,140&#160;km²&#160;of orangutan habitat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Compared to the baseline (253,153&#160;km²), more than 155,867&#160;km²&#160;or of 61.5% of orangutan habitat will be gone by 2025; see Table 1 in Supplementary Material.<br/><br/>The orangutan habitat remaining in 2010 (97,716&#160;km²) was either protected or designated for timber production (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Nonetheless, forest loss is expected to occur here too, owing to fires, encroachment and smallholder plantation development. Rates of forest loss measured at two sites with the largest Borneo orangutan populations are: 1.9% per year (1991–2000) and 1.5% per year (2000–2007) at Sebangau National Park (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2015); and 2.4% per year including the buffer zone, or 1.1% excluding the buffer zone (1988–2002) at Gunung Palung National Park (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004). The rate of loss in production forests outside formally protected areas will undoubtedly be&#160;higher (Santika <em>et al</em>. 2015). Thus we conservatively estimate the ongoing rate of loss in this administrative type of forest to be 1.5% per year. This will represent another 19,821&#160;km²&#160;of forest lost between 2010 and 2025: 20.2% of the orangutan habitat in 2010, or 8.7% in 1973.<br/><br/><strong>2. Habitat degradation and orangutan decline<br/></strong>In addition to habitat loss, selective logging has degraded 56% of Bornean Orangutan habitat since 1973 (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). The impacts of logging on orangutan density are variable, from little change in lightly-logged forest to major negative impacts in heavily-logged forest (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, selective&#160;artisanal&#160;logging reduced orangutan densities in peat-swamp forests by 21–30% (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2009), while mechanised logging in dryland forests is presumed to have a greater impact. Thus, 56% of the&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;range could undergo a&#160;20%&#160;decrease in carrying capacity. This estimate is conservative, considering that in Kalimantan the total area of natural forest allocated for timber extraction is increasing. Reduction in carrying capacity due to logging would then equate to a loss of 7% of the 1973 population by 2010, and overall accounts for 4% of the total projected 1973–2025 population decline.<br/><br/><strong>3. Hunting and orangutan decline<br/></strong>The widespread impacts of illegal hunting had not been quantified prior to a major questionnaire study throughout Kalimantan in 2008–2009 (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). The authors estimated that 630–1,357 Bornean Orangutans were killed in 2008 and that an average of 2,383–3,882 per year had been killed during the lifetimes of the survey respondents. The mean estimate (2,256 orangutans poached in Kalimantan each year) equates to 2.6% of the 2010 population for Kalimantan. Population losses due to hunting may be partially offset by population growth, which has a maximum theoretical rate of 2% annually (Marshall <em>et al</em>, 2009). The only study to have measured growth in a Bornean Orangutan population was carried out in Sebangau National Park in a population recovering from a logging-induced crash. Here, growth was relatively uninhibited and estimated to increase at an average annual rate of 1.6% between 2001 and 2013 (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is highly unlikely that a continuously-hunted population could recover at this rate, but in order to take into account uncertainties in determining the level of hunting, a 1.5% growth rate is applied, resulting in a net population decrease due to hunting of 1.1% annually. This equates to an additional loss (once habitat clearance and impacts of logging are factored in) of 18% of the 1973 population by 2010 and 7% of the 2010 population by 2025. Overall, poaching contributes 12% to the estimated 1973–2025 population decrease.<br/><br/>The combined impacts of habitat loss, habitat degradation and illegal hunting equate to an 86% population reduction between 1973 and 2025 which qualifies the species for listing as Critically Endangered. This estimate is relatively conservative, as it does not include additional future population losses anticipated due to stochastic effects that will reduce populations inhabiting increasingly small forest fragments.<br/><br/>Orangutan habitat loss and killing were already significant threats during the period 1950–1973, and the species was already declining at this time. However the paucity of data for this period prevents to estimate a specific rate of population decline for this specific period of time. However, if we assume that orangutan abundance in 1950 was similar to that in 1973 (which is not the case because any declines that occurred between 1950 and 1973 are not accounted for), our analysis shows that the species will suffer a more than 80% decline in three generations (1950–2025).</p>","<p>Bornean Orangutans are the largest arboreal mammals in the world, although they walk significant distances on the ground (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Historically,&#160;Bornean Orangutans were most abundant in inundated and semi-inundated lowland Dipterocarp mosaic forests, where movement between different habitat types could buffer them against shortages in food availability in a particular habitat type. Their diet consists primarily of fruits, but also includes leaves, barks, flowers and insects (Russon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Bornean Orangutans&#160;live a semi-solitary life and rarely aggregate in groups. Males are the dispersing sex: upon reaching sexual maturity (at 10–12 years old), they leave the area where they were born to establish large territories covering several hundred hectares. Females’ territories are smaller, with actual size depending on forest type and availability of food resources. Bornean Orangutans are very slow breeders and produce on average one offspring every 6–8 years, which explains their extreme sensitivity to hunting pressure. Females reach maturity at 10–15 years old; they generally give birth to a single infant after a gestation period of approximately 254 days (Kingsley 1981).</p>","Major threats include:<strong><br/></strong><ol><li><strong>Habitat loss</strong>. Between 2000 and 2010, the mean annual rate of&#160;deforestation&#160;for Borneo was 3,234&#160;km²&#160;per year (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). Assuming a similar deforestation rate in the future, 32,000                  km²&#160;of forest could be lost by 2020; 129,000                  km²&#160;by 2050 and 226,000                  km²&#160;by 2080 (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the early 2010s, only 22% of the current Bornean Orangutan distribution was located in protected areas (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Approximately a third of the entire&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;range was in commercial forest reserves exploited for timber, and about 45% was in forest areas earmarked for conversion to agriculture or other land uses. A business-as-usual scenario, whereby non-protected forests would be converted along the lines of current development plans, will result in the loss of more than half of the current orangutan range on the island of Borneo in the next 50 years or so.</li><li><strong>Illegal h</strong><strong>unting</strong>. Illegal killing of Bornean Orangutans is a major cause of their decline. Recent interview surveys conducted in Kalimantan revealed that several thousand individuals are killed every year for meat consumption, as a way to mitigate conflict, or for other reasons (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2013). Overall&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;mortality rates in Kalimantan seem to significantly exceed the maximum rates that populations of this slow-breeding species can sustain (Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009, Meijaard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). If hunting does not stop, all populations that are&#160;hunted&#160;will decline, irrespective of what happens to their habitat. These findings confirm that habitat protection alone will not ensure the survival of orangutans in Indonesian Borneo, and that effective reduction of orangutan killings is urgently needed.</li><li><strong>Fires</strong>.&#160;Fires occur in Borneo on a yearly basis and are responsible for significant forest loss with dramatic results for certain orangutan populations. For example, 90% of Kutai National Park was lost to massive fires in 1983 and 1998 and its&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;population was reduced from an estimated 4,000 individuals in the 1970s to a mere 600 (Rijksen and Meijaard 1999); over 4,000                  km²&#160;of peatland forest in southern Kalimantan was burnt to ashes in six months of 1997–1998, resulting in an estimated loss of 8,000 orangutans. In 2015, more than 20,000                  km²&#160;of forest were lost to fires, which resulted in hundreds (or more) of additional orangutan deaths.</li><li><strong>Habitat fragmentation</strong>. With the current scale of habitat exploitation and forest conversion to other types of land uses in Borneo, only a small percentage of current orangutan habitat will remain undisturbed by infrastructure development by 2030 (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2013). Several orangutan PHVAs have shown that Bornean Orangutan populations of fewer than 50 individuals are not viable in the long term (Marshall<em> <em>et al</em></em>. 2009), and that many small populations will go extinct unless they are actively managed (Bruford <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li><li><strong>Lack of awareness</strong>.&#160;A recent study suggested that 27% of the people in Kalimantan did not know that orangutans are protected by law (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). Campaigns to effectively inform the public and encourage rural people to support the principles of environmental conservation and be actively responsible for the management of their resources are therefore a crucial requirement for successful orangutan conservation.</li><li><strong>Climate change</strong>. Spatial models point to the possibility that a large amount of current orangutan habitat will become unsuitable because of changes in climate (Struebig <em>et al</em>. 2015). Across all climate and land-cover change projections assessed in a recent analysis, models predicted that 49,000–83,000                  km²&#160;of orangutan habitat will remain by 2080, reflecting a loss of 69–81% since 2010. This projection represents a three to five-fold greater decline in habitat than that predicted by deforestation projections alone.&#160;A major reduction in the extent of suitable orangutan habitat can be expected. However, core strongholds of suitable orangutan habitat are predicted to remain to the west, east and northeast of the island where populations of <em>P. p. wurmbii</em> and <em>P. p. morio</em> are found.</li></ol>","<p>Climatic change and human pressure have resulted in significant reductions in the range and numbers of Bornean Orangutans during the recent historic past (Goossens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Meijaard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The total number of orangutans in Borneo is not precisely known, except for Sabah, where comprehensive aerial surveys in the early 2000s provided an estimate of 11,000 individuals for the entire State (Ancrenaz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). The most recent (2004) estimate for the species is that <em>c.</em> 55,000&#160;Bornean Orangutans inhabit 82,000&#160;km²&#160;of forest (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, using modelling and the latest field data available for Borneo, a revised map of their current distribution gives a larger range estimate of 155,000&#160;km², or 21% of Borneo’s landmass (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). If the mean average orangutan density recorded in 2004 (0.67 individuals/km²) is applied to the updated geographic range, then the total population estimate would be 104,700 individuals.&#160;This represents a decline from an estimated 288,500 individuals in 1973 and is projected to decline further to 47,000 individuals by 2025.<br/><br/>Compounding loss of habitat, recent interview surveys in Kalimantan have concluded that 2,000–3,000 orangutans were killed every year in Indonesian Borneo during the past four decades alone (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). This would represent a loss of 44,170–66,570 individuals (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2013), or more than 50% of the original population in just 40 years. Such a rate of killings is unsustainable (Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009) and many populations will be reduced or become extinct in the next 50 years (Abram <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"The Bornean Orangutan is endemic to the island of Borneo where it is present in both the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, as well as in&#160;four of the five Indonesian Provinces of Kalimantan: North, East,&#160;Central and&#160;West&#160;Kalimantan.&#160;The distribution of Bornean Orangutans is highly patchy throughout the island; they are apparently absent or uncommon in the southeast, the forests between the Rejang River in central Sarawak, and the Padas River in western Sabah (including the Sultanate of Brunei).&#160;The Bornean Orangutan occurs preferentially in lowland forests below 500 m asl, but some individuals can also be found in highland habitats, for example, up to 1,500 m asl in Kinabalu National Park. Large rivers are natural barriers that are impassable to these animals and limit their dispersal (Goossens <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2005).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Bornean Orangutan is fully protected in Malaysia and Indonesia, and is listed on Appendix I of CITES.&#160;However, its forest habitat is not necessarily protected: about 20% of the current orangutan range in Sabah, and 80% in Kalimantan is not protected (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Innovative mechanisms to ensure the long-term survival of Bornean Orangutans outside protected forests are urgently needed.<br/><br/>The future of&#160;Bornean Orangutans&#160;will very much depend on the long-term security of large, strictly-protected forests where illegal logging and hunting will be efficiently controlled and the orangutan populations large enough to cope with catastrophic events such as fires and disease outbreaks (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). These forests need to contain the ecological gradients that will provide the&#160;key resources to sustain orangutans through climate and other gradual environmental changes (Gregory <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the larger landscape, scientifically-based, regional land-use planning is needed to delineate zones of interaction around protected forests and their surroundings, encompassing hydrological, ecological and socio-economic interactions. Ideally, the core protected areas will remain connected to other areas of forest that could be used sustainably for (commercial) timber extraction. The design of such living landscapes must be approached across the whole landscape rather than at the site level.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
156932432,22563,Tursiops truncatus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-05-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is among the most common cetacean species globally. These dolphins are distributed worldwide in all three major ocean basins and the Mediterranean Sea. They occur in tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters. The sum of available abundance estimates is around 750,000, however the vast majority of the species’ range has not been surveyed therefore actual abundance is considerably higher.</p>  <p>Coastal populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin are often small and resident and many of them are threatened by human activities. This species is bycaught in fishing gear throughout their range but quantitative data on bycatch rates are lacking in most areas. Several populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin are of particular conservation concern, including the Fiordland subpopulation in New Zealand which is classified as Critically Endangered (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013) the Mediterranean subpopulation which is classified as vulnerable (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the Black Sea subspecies which is classified as endangered (Birkum 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Some additional discrete resident populations face serious threats from a variety of sources that are resulting in significant population declines, and some of these (e.g., potentially the Gulf of California, Amvrakikos Gulf, or Slovenia populations) may be assessed as separate subpopulations on the Red List in the future. Despite all of this, the Common Bottlenose Dolphin is still one of the most widespread and abundant cetacean species, and to date there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a global population decline. This species was listed as Least Concern on the Red List in 2008 and it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment.</p>","<p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in a wide range of habitats from coastal to pelagic waters (Wells and Scott 1999). Where distinct ecotypes are known, the inshore form frequents estuaries, bays, lagoons and other shallow coastal regions, occasionally ranging far up into rivers. The offshore form tends to be less restricted in range and movement. Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins are residents around oceanic islands (Baird 2016). In many inshore areas Common Bottlenose Dolphins maintain definable, long-term, multi-generational home ranges, but in some locations near the extremes of the species’ range they are migratory. Off the coasts of North America, they tend to inhabit waters with surface temperatures ranging from about 10°C to 32°C (Wells and Scott, 1999). Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins are common over the shelf of this semi-enclosed basin; they sometimes occur far offshore (Birkun 2006).<br/> <br/> Common Bottlenose Dolphins are commonly associated with many other cetaceans, including large whales and other dolphin species (Wells and Scott 1999). Mixed schools with Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have been observed, for instance, in the Taiwan Strait (J. Wang pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> Bottlenose Dolphins consume a wide variety of prey species, mostly fish and squid (Barros and Odell 1990, Barros and Wells 1998, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2001, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2001). They sometimes eat shrimp and other crustaceans.</p>","<p>In many places Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in coastal waters, bringing them into contact with human activities. Conservation problems are known or suspected for at least: (a) the Critically Endangered Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation in New Zealand (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013), (b) the Endangered Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies (Birkun 2012), (c) the Vulnerable Mediterranean Sea subpopulation (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012), and the dolphins in (d) Sri Lanka (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989); (e) Peru, Ecuador, and Chile (Read <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1990, Sanino <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010); (f) Taiwan (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1999 pers. comm.); (g) Japan (Kasuya 2017) and (h) Gulf of California, Mexico (Segura-García <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Dolphin catches for bait, for human consumption, or to reduce competition with fisheries have been reported worldwide (Wells and Scott 1999, 2018). In a global review of the use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were among the most frequently used (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018). They were reported as being used for bait in Ghana, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela and Spain. In Peru, some coastal artisanal fisheries from at least one port take <em>Common Bottlenose Dolphins</em> for bait, using harpoons, while about 57% of Common Bottlenose Dolphins caught in gillnets as bycatch are discarded at sea; the extent to which such takes occur elsewhere along the Peruvian coast is not known (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species is taken opportunistically by harpoon in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). In Taiwan, Common Bottlenose Dolphins comprised a major part of the small cetaceans taken by harpoon in the past (J. Wang, pers. comm.). Although little evidence has been collected and reported since the 1990s, illegal hunting of cetaceans still occurs in Taiwan as evidenced by periodic news reports of police confiscations of cetacean parts. Directed hunting of cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, for local consumption occurs in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975) and in West Africa (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is reported to be one of several species targeted by hunters in Indonesia (Mustika 2006). <br/> <br/> The only Mediterranean area with quantitative historical information is the northern Adriatic Sea, where Common Bottlenose Dolphins likely have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, largely as a consequence of historical killing in extermination campaigns to reduce competition for fish, followed by habitat degradation and overfishing. The extermination campaigns were conducted until the early 1960s (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). For the northwestern Mediterranean, the available information suggests similar trends (Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). There continues to be substantial incidental mortality in fishing gear, and overfishing of dolphin prey, disturbance by marine traffic, and high levels of contamination by pollutants are of concern in much of the Mediterranean Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Drive hunts of small cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, exist in the Faroe Islands and Japan. Up to 308 are taken annually in the Faroe Islands drive hunt (dating back to 1803), often with Long-finned Pilot Whales (Reyes 1991, Bloch 1998). Drive and harpoon hunts in Japan catch Common Bottlenose Dolphins for human consumption and to remove perceived competition with commercial fisheries (Wells and Scott 1999, Kasuya 2017). Average catch from 1995–2004 was 594 per year (Kasuya 2017). Since 2000, the catch at Taiji in Japan has declined to fewer than 200 Common Bottlenose Dolphins per year, after a peak of 1,670 in 1987 (Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> The Endangered Black Sea subspecies was hunted extensively to obtain commercial products including oils, lubricants, food, meal, glue, and leather goods (Tomilin 1957, Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). An estimated 24,000 - 28,000 were taken in the Black Sea off Turkey during 1946–1983. However, the total number killed was certainly much greater (probably by tens of thousands) as these figures do not include, or only partially include, catch statistics from other Black Sea countries (Birkun 2006, 2012).<br/> <br/> The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is the most common cetacean species in captivity worldwide (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Live captures of Common Bottlenose Dolphins for public display, research, and military applications have occurred in several parts of the species' range. There is no worldwide estimate of the scale of these removals, but more than 1,500 were live-captured in United States, Mexican, and Bahamian waters through 1980 (Leatherwood and Reeves 1982, Fisher and Reeves 2005). Up to 1983 at least 198 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were reported to have been live-captured for European aquaria (Collet 1984). More recently, eight were collected illegally in the Dominican Republic in 2002 (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010) and live-capture efforts in Senegal in 2003 led to the death of at least five dolphins (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). At least 238 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were live-captured in Cuba in 1986–2004 (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2006), and 15 in the Solomon Islands in 2013 (Oremus <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins captured during drive hunts in Japan are collected alive for marine parks in Japan and internationally (Butterworth <em>et al</em>. 2013). The cumulative live-capture removals of Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins, not counting mortality during capture operations, is estimated to be from several hundred up to around 1,000 since the mid-1960s for military, academic, and display purposes, including swim-with-dolphins programs (Birkun 2002). Live-captures through 2002 took 10-20 animals annually from a small area in the Kerch Strait, Russia (Birkun 2002, 2006, 2012). According to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) statistics, at least 92 individuals were removed from the Black Sea region during 1990-1999 (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003), and Russia reportedly exported at least 66 for travelling shows from 1997-2005 (Fisher and Reeves 2005). <br/> <br/> Incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins is known to occur throughout the species’ range in set gillnets, drift gillnets, purse seines, trawls, and longlines, and on hook-and-line gear used in commercial and recreational fisheries, but the level of mortality is poorly documented from most range states (Wells and Scott 1999, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2008). Set gillnet, purse-seine and drift gillnet fisheries off Peru continue to take an unknown but potentially large number annually (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2017b, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2010), and some of those taken as bycatch or directly were being sold in fish markets at least through 2007, as determined by molecular evidence (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2010). Prior to 2001, the estimated annual incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery for tuna ranged up to almost 200 per year, but during 2001-2016, the average mortality declined to 2.9 per year (Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission data, M. Scott pers. comm.). Incidental catches in Chinese fisheries reached several hundred per year in the 1990s (Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999). Bottom trawls and sink gillnets in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. take on average 27 offshore Common Bottlenose Dolphins annually, pelagic longlines take 12 Common Bottlenose Dolphins on average each year (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and shrimp trawls take an unknown number each year (Greenman and McFee 2014). Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the third most frequently caught cetaceans in gillnets in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). Taiwanese coastal and distant-water longline fisheries for tunas and sharks take Common Bottlenose Dolphins incidentally, as do a variety of Taiwanese gillnet (including driftnets and trammel nets) and purse-seine fisheries in coastal and distant (e.g., Western Tropical Pacific) waters (Wang and Yang 2002, J. Wang pers. comm.). <br/> <br/> Annual Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets from 1946 through the 1980s was roughly estimated as being in the hundreds. The scale of this mortality almost certainly increased in the 1990s-2000s owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (Birkun 2006, 2012). According to Öztürk (1999) at least 200 Bottlenose Dolphins may have been taken incidentally per year in Turkish fisheries in a variety of fishing nets, especially bottom-set gill nets.&#160;</p>  <p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal areas are exposed to a wide variety of threats in addition to direct and incidental takes (Vollmer and Rosel 2013). Threats that are cause for concern include: 1) the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals; 2) reduced prey availability caused by environmental degradation and overfishing; 3) direct and indirect disturbance and harassment (e.g., boat traffic and commercial dolphin watching and interactive programs); 4) marine construction, including demolition, dredging, and land reclamation, and 5) other forms of habitat destruction and degradation (including anthropogenic noise). Although these and other threats are technically challenging to quantify by comparison with removals, their cumulative impact is likely to result in population declines. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to an increasing number of Unusual Mortality Events involving Common Bottlenose Dolphins remains to be determined (Spradlin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>The Critically Endangered Fiordland (New Zealand) Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation faces threats from boat-based tourism, increased freshwater discharge from hydroelectric power generation, and reduced prey availability from environmental degradation and overfishing (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Environmental contaminants likely impact health and reproductive success of the Common Bottlenose Dolphins in parts of its range. Lahvis <em>et al</em>. (1995) correlated concentrations of PCBs and DDT in the blood of inshore Bottlenose Dolphins with decline in immune system function. Males in some areas such as Florida accumulate levels of PCBs more than an order of magnitude greater than the threshold for adverse health effects identified by Kannan <em>et al</em>. (2000). A risk assessment relative to PCB burdens suggested elevated probabilities of first-born mortality at several sites in the U.S. (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005). Jepson <em>et al.</em> (2016) reported that Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Europe had mean PCB concentrations that greatly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The spatial patterns of PBDEs and the ΣDDTs/ΣPCBs detected in Common Bottlenose Dolphin blubber have been shown to vary significantly with adjacent watersheds and land use associations in the southeastern United States (Adams <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>The <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> oil spill in 2010 was one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the history of the United States. The oil spill adversely impacted the health, reproduction, and survival of Common Bottlenose Dolphins along much of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lane <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the stock in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, where oiling was heavy, the spill resulted in an estimated 30,347 lost cetacean years (the difference between baseline and injured population size, summed over the modeled time period) (95% CI: 11,511-89,746), and models suggested the time to recovery of the population would be 39 years (95% CI: 24 to 80) (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2017). Similar recovery timelines were predicted for other nearby stocks. There is concern that planned large-scale diversions of fresh water from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay may hamper the recovery of this stock.</p>  <p>&#160;Common Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes forage around fish-farm cages or take fish from gillnets (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001, Read <em>et al</em>. 2003), commercial trawling gear, crab traps, or recreational fishing gear (Wells and Scott 1999). This can result in incidental mortality through entanglement, hooking, and ingestion of gear (Powell and Wells 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016, Stolen <em>et al.</em> 2013). Common Bottlenose Dolphins conditioned to receive food items are more likely to be injured by human interactions than unconditioned dolphins, leading to decreased survival and potentially to consequences at the population level (Donaldson <em>et al</em>. 2010, Christiansen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Developments in recreational fishing line technology include microfilament braided twine that is more damaging to dolphin tissues than simple monofilament (Barco <em>et al</em>. 2010). Dredging and demolition associated with marine construction have been demonstrated to at least temporarily displace Common Bottlenose Dolphins from their normal range (Buckstaff <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pirotta <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Morbillivirus has been responsible for several documented epizootic events involving deaths of hundreds to thousands of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2011). During an outbreak along the U.S. Atlantic coast in 1987-88, more than 740 Common Bottlenose Dolphins died between New Jersey and Florida. During 2013-2015, more than 1,800 Common Bottlenose Dolphin carcasses were recovered during a morbillivirus event along the Atlantic coast from New York to Florida (NOAA/NMFS 2015). In each of these cases, it should be noted that only a fraction of the actual mortality is generally documented as stranded carcasses, so the number of deaths from the disease are likely much higher (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is not known if anthropogenic factors increase susceptibility to the disease.</p>","<p></p><p>Abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins has been estimated for several parts of the species' range. Summing available estimates, a minimum world-wide abundance estimate would be 750,000, acknowledging that most of the range of the species has not been surveyed for abundance estimation, and some of the estimates included in the summation are out of date.<br/> <br/> <a name=""_Hlk523388145"">Recent surveys by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017) have estimated 97,964 Bottlenose Dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico <strong>(</strong>5,806 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.39) in oceanic waters beyond the shelf edge, 51,192 (CV = 0.10) on the outer continental shelf, 39,734 in coastal waters, and 1,232 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. There are approximately 110,000 Common Bottlenose Dolphins off the east coast of North America (including 77,532 (CV = 0.40) in offshore waters, 31,212 in coastal waters, and 1,209 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. For both regions, current estimates are not available for most of the bays, sounds, and estuaries (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Recent stock assessment reports for U.S. Pacific waters indicated that there are 453 (CV = 0.06) Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal California waters, and 1,924 (CV = 0.54) in the offshore waters of California, Oregon, and Washington (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). These stock assessments include abundance estimates for individual stocks in Hawaiian waters: Kauai/Niihau, 147 (CV = 0.11), Oahu, 594 (CV = 0.54), 4-Islands, 153 (CV = 0.24), Hawaii Island, 102 (CV = 0.13), and Hawaii Pelagic, 5,590 (CV = 0.59) (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific resulted in an estimate of 243,500 (CV = 0.29) (Wade and Gerrodette 1993), but this estimate should be considered with caution given the fact that it is more than 25 years old. No recent abundance estimates for Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Japanese waters are available (Kasuya 2017). Japanese surveys prior to 1993 resulted in estimates of 168,000 (CV = 0.26) in the Northwestern Pacific west of 180ºE, including 36,791 (CV = 0.25) in Japanese coastal waters (Miyashita 1993). In the eastern Sulu Sea, Dolar <em>et al.</em> (2006) estimated 2,628 Common Bottlenose Dolphins 1994-1995 (CV = 0.40). </a></p>  <p>A large-scale survey (SCANS-III) of European Atlantic waters from the Strait of Gibraltar in the south to 62°N in the north and extending west to the 200 nm limits of most European Union Member State Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) was conducted in 2016 (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). The final surveyed area excluded offshore waters of Portugal and to the south and west of Ireland (surveyed by the Irish ObSERVE project), and included coastal waters of Norway north to Vestfjorden. In total, 27,700 (CV = 0.23) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). As part of the ObSERVE aerial surveys of the Irish EEZ, 8,700 km of line transect aerial surveys were conducted in Beaufort sea state ≤4 in both the summer (May-June 2016) and winter (November-February) of 2016/2017. There were clear seasonal differences in habitat use and abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins, which showed an approximate 2.5 fold increase in density during winter (0.626 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) compared to summer (0.257 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>). The summer abundance estimate was 87,330 (CV = 0.21) (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Scottish waters, abundance was estimated as 195 (95% highest posterior density intervals (HPDI): 162–253) from the Moray Firth to Fife and 45 (95% HPDI: 33–66) in the Hebrides, leading to the conclusion that 200-300 Common Bottlenose Dolphins inhabit the inshore coastal waters of Scotland (Cheney <em>et al</em>. 2013). A community of 420 dolphins (95% confidence interval (CI) = 331–521) was documented in the Normano-Breton Gulf of the English Channel (Louis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Photo-identification surveys of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Shannon Estuary of western Ireland in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 107 (CV = 0.12; 95% CI = 83 to 131)) (Berrow <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Total abundance for the Mediterranean Sea Common Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation, listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, is unknown but thought to be in the low 10,000’s and decreasing (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). Surveys of 86,000 km<sup>2</sup> of the northwestern Mediterranean off Spain in 2002 estimated 7,654 (CV = 0.45) Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on surveys in 2000-2003 an estimated 584 (CV = 0.28) individuals occur in the Alboran Sea of Spain (Cañadas and Hammond 2006). Abundance estimates for other parts of the Mediterranean Sea include 148 (95% CI = 132 to 180) in the Amvrakikos Gulf, western Greece (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008), 1,676 (95% CI = 804-3,492) in the Pelagos Sanctuary of the western Mediterranean (Lauriano <em>et al</em>. 2014), 517 (95% CI = 406-658) in the Balearic Islands (Gonzalvo <em>et al</em>. 2014), and 42 (95% CI = 42.0 to 43.1)<strong> </strong>off northeastern Tunisia (Benmessaoud <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline in the resident Common Bottlenose Dolphin population inhabiting the Kvarnerić area of the northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia during 1995-2003 appears to have been reversed, with about 200 individuals currently using the area (Pleslić <em>et al.</em> 2013). Bottlenose dolphins near Lampedusa Island, Italy, have increased significantly since 1998 to 249 (95% CI = 162 to 449) (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins exhibit subpopulation structure, based on behavior, toxicology, diet, and genetics (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2005, Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>The total population size of the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies, currently listed as Endangered, is unknown. However, there are abundance estimates for parts of the range suggesting that population size is at least several thousand individuals (Birkun 2006, 2012).</p>  <p>Off South America, 83 (95% CI = 73 to 112) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated in Bahía San Antonio, Argentina in 2006-2008 (Vermuelen and Cammareri 2009). Further to the south in Patagonia, in Golfo San José and adjacent areas, Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance has declined since the 1970s from at least 53 to 34 dolphins (CV = 0.20) and range shifts have been observed; the causes of these changes could not be conclusively determined (Coscarella <em>et al</em>. 2012). Investigations into possible short-term declines in Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance due to bycatch in Patos Lagoon, Brazil, found the population to be stable over the period 1998-2012, with an estimate in 2012 of 78 animals (95% CI = 70-86) (Fruet <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015). &#160;</p>  <p>Off New Zealand, the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation is listed as Critically Endangered, with only 205 (95% CI: 192-219) individuals in 2008, of which 123 were mature (Currey <em>et al. </em>2009). Elsewhere in New Zealand, there are an estimated 211 Common Bottlenose Dolphins (95% CI = 195 to 232) in the Marlborough Sounds (Merriman <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 92 (95% CI = 80 to 111) near Stewart Island (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015). Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand showed a 7.5% annual rate of decline from 1997-1999 to 2003-2006 (Tezanos-Pinto <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Around the island of São Tomé, off the west coast of Africa, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the most commonly sighted cetaceans during a total of 226 surveys between 2002 and 2006, and in 2012. In total, 140 individuals were photo-identified, and the high rate of discovery of new individuals suggested that these were part of a much larger population (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2011-2013, during 13,694 km of visual survey transects in continental shelf and slope waters off Northwest Africa, between Tangier and Conakry<em>, T. truncatus</em> were (after the Common Dolphin <em>Delphinus delphis</em>) the second-most frequently encountered cetaceans, accounting for 9.6% of total sightings (Djiba <em>et al.</em> 2015). In offshore waters of the Western Indian Ocean, Bottlenose Dolphins, the majority of which appeared to be <em>T. truncatus</em>, were among the most common cetaceans observed (Ballance and Pitman 1998).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"Common Bottlenose Dolphins occur worldwide through tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1990, Wells and Scott 1999, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2000). They range poleward of 45° in northern Europe (as far as the Faroe Islands 62°N 7°W; Bloch and Mikkelsen 2000) and southern New Zealand (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the species was recently reported as far south as 53-55<sup>o</sup>S in South America (Olavarría <em>et al</em>. 2010, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the eastern Pacific they have been seen as far north as British Columbia (50<sup>o</sup>N) but their typical range is up to 41<sup>o</sup>N (Halpin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Common Bottlenose Dolphins are rare in the Baltic Sea (best considered extralimital there) and are vagrant to Newfoundland and Norway (Wells and Scott 1999). They occur regularly in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the Arabian Sea (Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 1999).","<p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins are hunted in some areas (St. Vincent, Sri Lanka, Japan, Indonesia, West Africa) for human consumption, and as bait in fisheries. In addition, Common Bottlenose Dolphins are sometimes removed from the wild and maintained under human care for public display, research, and training to support specific military and civilian functions at sea. They are increasingly the objects of dolphin watching (tourism) activities.</p>",Marine,"<p>The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

(Shanee<em> et al</em>. 2015). <em>Aotus miconax</em> occurs in primary and secondary forest (including disturbed forest, selectively logged and agroforestry ecosystems) (Cornejo <em>et al.</em> 2008, Shanee and Shanee 2011, Shanee <em>et al. </em>2015, Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2013). <br/><br/>As with most night monkeys, this species is nocturnal with an activity peak at the beginning of the night (Shanee<em> et al. </em>2013). In one study this species averaged 54% of their time travelling, 13% resting and 33% feeding; their diet consists of fruits (42%), flowers (5%), leaves (6%), buds (25%) and insects (19%). Favourite arboreal food sources include <em>Styloceras laurifolium, Cercropia montana, C. utcubambana, Hyeronima andina, Ficus eximia, Casearia decandra, Chrysophyllum venezuelanense, Ceroxylon peruvianum, Neosprucea montana, Solanum sp., Inga feuillei, Bunchosia armeniaca </em>and <em>Styrax</em> sp.(Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, living in small groups of up to six individuals (Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2013), consisting of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a sub-adult, with solitary individuals of both sexes found (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2011), possibly sub-adults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002; Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Males carry and care for the infants (Rotundo <em>et al.</em> 2005).","<em></em>The Andean Night Monkey (<em>Aotus miconax</em>) is endemic to Peru, where it is threatened by deforestation, habitat disturbance and hunting. Shanee <em>et al</em>. (2015), conducting field surveys from 2009 to 2013 and using combined GIS and ecological niche modelling, estimated the species’ original extent of suitable habitat at close to 33,000 km², the third lowest of the 11 <em>Aotus </em>species. Of this, approximately 17,700 km² of suitable habitat remained at the completion of those surveys, representing a loss of close to 50% (up to 2013). Habitat loss within three of the four provinces in which <em>A. miconax</em> is found—Amazonas, Huanuco and San Martin—has been disproportionately high, accounting for nearly 40% of Peru’s total deforestation during the period 2010-2014, this within only 14% of the national land surface (Ministerio del Ambiente – Peru 2015). Forest loss and fragmentation continue, especially within the peripheral areas of this species’ range, with an expansion of mining and large-scale monocultures reaching higher into the Andean foothills. Hunting for food follows immigration into new areas, with young night monkeys also routinely taken as pets in the process. Given that this species appears to adapt to shrinking habitats, it's  rate of decline may not be as precipitous, but is still sufficiently  significant to qualify it as threatened.","Little is known about the population characteristics of <em>Aotus miconax</em>. In some areas it appears to remain fairly common in forest patches and even able to persist in agroforestry ecosystems and shade coffee plantations (Shanee <em>et al. </em>2015, Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, rates of habitat loss approaching 50% throughout large portions of its distribution undoubtedly have negatively impacted populations to significant degrees.",Decreasing,"<em>Aotus miconax </em>is endemic to the Peruvian Andes, occurring south and east of the Río Marañón and west of the Río Huallaga in the departments of Amazonas, Huánuco, La Libertad, San Martin and possibly areas of Loreto (Hershkovitz 1983; Aquino and Encarnación 1994a; Shanee<em> et al. </em>2015). Shanee <em>et al.</em> (2015) suggested distributional limits for this species as the highlands of La Libertad and the Río Marañón to the west, the lowlands of the Río Marañón in Amazonas to the north and the lowlands of Loreto to the north-east, the lowlands of the Rio Huallaga valley to the east. The southern limit of this species distribution is still not well defined but <em>A. nancymaae</em> is present to ~1,000 m asl. in this area (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015).

166519315,13143,Melursus ursinus,Vulnerable,A3c,2020,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There are no reliable large-scale population estimates for Sloth Bears, nor any reliable large-scale estimates of population change. Since the total occupied area in India has been variously estimated at between 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauhan 2006) and 400,000 km² (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), or even more (Puri <em>et al</em>. 2015), it is impossible to gauge population trend from changes in occupied area. However, there is, throughout most of the range, a clear trend in deterioration of habitat, which has caused Sloth Bear populations to decline (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008). This deterioration in habitat is expected to accelerate in the future.<br/> <br/> Habitat outside of protected areas is under severe and growing pressure due to demands for natural resources and the ever increasing populations of both humans and livestock in the region (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006a). This problem is compounded by many factors including that in India, where the vast majority of Sloth Bear habitat is located: 1) the per capita forest area is only one-tenth of the world’s average; 2) there is a demand–supply gap for construction timber leading to over-harvesting and degradation of natural ecosystems; 3) an estimated 78% of forests are subjected to heavy grazing causing degradation of forest habitat; and 4) vast stretches of forest are still diverted for a variety of developmental and infrastructural projects (Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2009). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2015) reported that India had a 0.3% rate increase of forest area during 2010-2015, due to afforestation. However, the type and location of all the forest planted is unspecified. Much of this afforestation effort is occurring in more urban areas and it is not known how much is accessible to Sloth Bears.<br/> <br/> The human population growth in India is presently the greatest threat to Sloth Bears. It drives the loss and degradation of habitat and is likely the cause for growing human-bear conflicts in the country. The population of India is expected to increase by 366,000,000 people (roughly 30%) over the next 30 years&#160; (US Census bureau, International database <a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php"">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php</a>). This extraordinary population growth is likely to have major direct and indirect impacts on Sloth Bear populations, especially those existing outside protected areas. The human population growth of India is particularly alarming because 90-95%of the range of Sloth Bears is in India. Likewise, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> (2007) predicted a future decline in Sloth Bear numbers in Sri Lanka due to burgeoning human densities and commensurate habitat deterioration and increasing conflicts.<br/> <br/> The recent extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013) highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations, especially outside of protected areas, where half or more of the populations exist. Sloth Bears are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most readily used and developed by people. Moreover, the aggressiveness of this species makes them incompatible with high human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, Sloth Bear populations are expected to continue declining, at an increasing rate, resulting in a &gt;30% loss over the next 30 years (three generations).</p>","<p>Sloth Bears subsist primarily on termites, ants, and fruits. Sloth Bears are the only species of bear adapted specifically for myrmecophagy (ant and termite-eating; Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). Like other myrmecphagous mammals, they have especially small home ranges compared to other ursids (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The ratio of insects to fruits in the diet varies with the seasonal and geographical availability of each food (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1997, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Mewada and Dharaiya 2010, Sukhadiya <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fruits may comprise 70‒90% of the diet during the fruiting season, whereas termites and other insects may comprise &gt;80% of the diet the rest of the year (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears occupy a wide range of habitats on the Indian mainland including wet and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands, and grasslands (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ramesh <em>et al.</em> 2012). They are primarily a lowland species. Most Sloth Bear range in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is limited to habitats below 1500 m, although the species may occur as high as 2,000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats (Johnsingh 2003, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sri Lanka, Sloth Bears are confined to the remaining dry forests in the north and eastern parts of the island, mostly below 300 m (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006). In areas where forest cover is sparse but daytime temperatures are high (a large part of the range), the bear is principally nocturnal or crepuscular and shelters in rock outcrops, thickets, and tree cavities during the heat of the day. Although some Sloth Bears may be active during the day in protected areas (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999), they tend to be almost exclusively nocturnal in disturbed and fragmented forests interspersed with human habitations (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004; Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2012).<br/> <br/> Studies in Nepal and Sri Lanka suggest that Sloth Bears avoid areas where human disturbance is high, so crop depredation by Sloth Bears is uncommon (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). However, in some parts of India, Sloth Bears routinely raid peanut, maize, and fruit crops (Chhangani 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; In some of these areas the habitats are severely degraded and affected by human exploitation, including the extraction of several food sources of the Sloth Bear.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears typically breed May through July, and females give birth, usually to one or two cubs, from November to January (Laurie and Seidensticker 1977, Iswariah 1984, Gopal 1991, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Chauhan <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spady <em>et al.</em> 2007). Cubs often ride on the mother's back during their first nine months, presumably to reduce the risk of predation. Cubs remain with their mothers for 1.5-2.5 years resulting in a 2 or 3 year interbirth interval (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species are habitat loss or degradation (often related to human population growth), retaliation from human‒bear conflicts, and (to a lesser degree) poaching (Johnsingh 2003, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bargali <em>et al. </em>2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).<br/> <br/> In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and possibly Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).</p>","<p>Information is available on the area of potentially occupied range in India (Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar<em> et al. </em>2012), Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a), and Sri Lanka (Ratnayeke <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b). The potential Sloth Bear distribution in India was estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al. </em>2004, Chauhan 2006) but the more recent National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan 2012 (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the occupied range is twice that large (400,000 km²). An even more recent survey suggested that Sloth Bears may occupy 52% of the land area of India (Puri <em>et al.</em> 2015). Notably, though, the latter study was based on very large sampling cells (2,800 km² across a sampling region of nearly 3 million km²), and any cell estimated to be occupied would have been considered as fully occupied; this would inflate the range area considerably. In short, the results of this study do not appear to reflect the reality of Sloth Bear distribution in India as they clearly do not occur in &gt;50% of the land area. Additionally, the model predicts Sloth Bear occurrence in specific places where they are known to be absent, such as Gir Forest. However, the study does demonstrate that Sloth Bears can live in relatively small degraded areas.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears can occur at high densities. However, there are few reliable Sloth Bear density estimates: most estimates have been based on opinions gleaned from interviews and questionnaires (e.g., Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006). The one robust density estimate for this species, which was based on mark–resight of radio-collared bears, yielded an estimate of 27 bears/100 km² for Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and as high as 72 bears/100 km² in a core area of the park (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). Gopalaswamy (2006) attempted a rigorous estimate based on presence-absence records at camera traps (as per Royle and Nichols 2003), but detection rates were too low to produce a useful estimate.<br/> <br/> Attempts have been made to apply estimated densities in various protected areas to all occupied areas to obtain a range-wide population estimate. Depending on methods and data employed in this process, range-wide estimates have varied from &lt;10,000 to &gt;20,000 bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). None of these estimates are considered reliable enough to track changes in population size, especially since the total range area is not well defined. Estimates for individual Indian states are also not reliable enough to track population trends (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The population of Sloth Bears on the island of Sri Lanka is equally not well understood. Santiapillai and Santiapillai (1990) tentatively reported a population of 300–600 bears for the island. Ratneyeke <em>et al.</em> (2007a) estimated, based on home ranges of radio-collared bears that Wasgomuwa National Park alone may support more than 100-150 sloth bears. This national park only makes up roughly 5% of the known Sloth Bear range in Sri Lanka and therefore the population likely well exceeds the previous estimate.<br/> <br/> Increased habitat fragmentation and a decrease of occupied habitat have been observed in many parts of the Sloth Bear range (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008, Bargali 2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). However, rigorous assessments of population change are rare. Jhala <em>et al.</em> (2011) compared occupancy of Sloth Bears in select areas from 2006 to 2010, during a comprehensive Tiger survey across India, and reported five decreasing, four increasing, and three stable bear populations; although the methods and short time span between surveys probably precluded a reliable indication of population trend.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sloth Bear’s historical distribution includes a large portion of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as well as the southern lowlands of Nepal and presumably Bhutan. Some unverified reports suggested that they once occurred in the western-most corner of present day Myanmar (Erdbrink 1953), but this was never confirmed and seems unlikely based on the mountainous habitat. Historically this species overlapped the distributions of Asiatic Black Bears (<span class=""sciname""><em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) in northern India (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2012), and with both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) in northeastern India (Choudhury 2011).&#160;Historical records are confusing, though, because Sloth Bears and Asiatic Black Bears look alike and were often not reliably distinguished.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>India</u></strong><br/> At least 90% of the present Sloth Bear range occurs in India. Within India their distribution is constrained to the south by the ocean, to the northwest by deserts, and to the north and east by mountains. Although Sloth Bears were once common and even abundant throughout the Indian Peninsula (McTaggart Cowan 1972, Krishnan 1972, Brander 1982), their range has shrunk and densities reduced due to continuous habitat loss and human-caused mortalities. Although still found scattered across much of its former range, their actual distribution is now highly fragmented and confined mainly to five distinct regions, namely northern, northeastern, central, southeastern, and southwestern (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Johnsingh 2003, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The northern distribution region occurs largely within the state of Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012), but also includes the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and the northwestern tip of Bihar. This northern region borders the southern and western areas of Nepal and includes trans-border populations. However, the northern region remains completely isolated from the other population regions in India due to large scale forest removal and agriculture and human settlements.<br/> <br/> The northeastern region is the farthest east that this species occurs and is perhaps the least understood region in terms of Sloth Bear distribution. The bulk of the distribution appears to occur in the state of Assam (Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), though Sloth Bears are also known from Manipur, Megalaya and Arunachal Pradesh (where it is very rare). The fact that the distribution of Sloth Bears in this region overlaps with that of both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears has made reports of Sloth Bear occurrence less reliable.<br/> <br/> The central region is the largest region. The bulk of the distribution occurs in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, but includes the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Just south of this region, in the southern half of Andhra Pradesh, is the southeastern region, which occurs along the Eastern Ghats. It is not known whether bears move between the central and southeastern regions.<br/> <br/> The southwestern area follows the Western Ghats and principally falls within the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where there may be a connection to the southeastern region. They have been observed up to 2,000 m elevation in the Western Ghats (A.J.T. Johnsingh, personal communication, in Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a). They also stretch northwestward into Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Nepal</u></strong><br/> In Nepal, Sloth Bears are most common within the narrow strip of lowland grassland–forest mosaic called the Terai. They also range into the lower Siwaliks (maximum elevation is unknown). The bears are mainly in protected areas in the central and western portions of the Terai. Since the mid-1980s, they were thought to have been extirpated from the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in western Nepal, an area containing the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). However, during a 2013 Tiger camera trap study in the reserve a photo of a Sloth Bear was captured. Then in 2014 Sloth Bear tracks and scat were recorded in the reserve as well (Babu Ram Lamichane, National Trust for Nature Conservation—Suklaphanta Conservation Program, pers. comm., 2015). Therefore, it appears that Sloth Bears have recolonized Sulka Phanta Wildlife Reserve, likely from adjacent Piliphit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India, which is known to have Sloth Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012); alternately, Sloth Bears persisted in such small numbers that they went undetected for several years (Johnsingh 2003). Some of the Sloth Bear populations in Nepal remain connected with the Indian northern region (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bangladesh</u><br/> </strong>Sloth Bears have been extirpated from Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last documented records are from the mid-1990s (NCSIP-1 2001, Sarker 2006). Although they had been present in the southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, the forest patches in which they persisted have been largely removed (Sarker 2006).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bhutan</u></strong><br/> Recent investigations suggest that if Sloth Bears occupy Bhutan, they are very rare. Garshelis <em>et al.</em> (1999a) mapped two populations of Sloth Bears in Bhutan, including Royal Manas National Park (RMNP) and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Their range map was based on habitat-elevation information and purported documentation of presence.&#160; However, due to frequent confusion in distinguishing Sloth Bears from Asiatic Black Bears, it is now apparent that this range map was wrong. Sloth Bears appear to have a much narrower range in Bhutan, if at all. One camera trap photo in RMNP, taken in 2009, 2 km from the Indian border, is the only current verified record of presence (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Grasslands, which are preferred habitat for Sloth Bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999 a,b; Choudhury 2011) are present in both RMNP and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and both of these protected areas are connected to protected areas in India, known to contain sloth bears. However, it is not known whether a true trans-boundary population exists anywhere along this border, or if just a few vagrant bears occasionally come across to the Bhutan side (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Sri Lanka</u></strong><br/> The Sri Lankan Sloth Bear subspecies is distributed in the north and east sides of the island and is closely tied with forest cover (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). Sloth Bears occupy roughly 17% of the island and there is still a high connectivity between occupied areas. However, recent civil war activities largely occurred in the northern and eastern sides of the island, which are home to the largest contiguous forest patches and which historically supported healthy Sloth Bear populations. These areas have gone largely unprotected and it is still unknown how sloth bear distribution may have been affected (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007a).</p>","<p>Poaching of Sloth Bears for trade in parts has been reported (Servheen 1990, Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), but its current extent and impact on bear populations is uncertain. Compared to other Asian bear species, commercial trade in Sloth Bear parts appears to be relatively low (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Poaching also occurs for local use: male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997, Chauhan 2006). Occasional rashes of poaching incidents have been reported. For example, in Madhya Pradesh in 2014, at least eight male bears were found professionally poached, as indicated by the skilful removal of their reproductive organs, gall bladders and claws (Basu 2014, Naveen 2014). Two of the dead bears were found near the buffer area of Khana Tiger Reserve, while the others were found in less protected forests in the state. The manner in which the bear parts were removed led many to speculate that that the poaching may be taking place on a larger scale and that the parts may have been removed for illegal international trade.<br/> <br/> The capture of cubs, which often includes the killing of the mother bear, for use as street-show ""dancing bears"" (Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997) used to be a threat in some parts of India, but has been controlled to a significant level (D’Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2011). This practice has been illegal in India since 1972, though it continued in earnest until 2009. However it persists to a small degree in southern Nepal. It is unclear if the practitioners were always in Nepal or if they crossed the border to Nepal from India due to the political pressure to end the practice in India. Several dancing bears have been confiscated at the Nepal-India border while they were being brought into India (K. Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS, personal communication, 2015). Additionally, a cub was rescued that was being smuggled into Nepal with clear signs that it was to be sold for use as a dancing bear (Wildlife SOS 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Sloth Bears are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are completely protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. They are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in the other range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears are reported to exist in 174 Protected Areas (PAs) in India, which include 46 National Parks and 128 Wildlife Sanctuaries (Chauhan 2006). Populations appear to be reasonably well protected when inside these PAs, but face deteriorating habitat conditions outside (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dharaiya, 2009). Reduced cover and food resources outside PAs (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004) have led to increased human–bear conflicts, including frequent maulings (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is estimated that half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside PAs. Roughly half the occupied range in Sri Lanka occurs outside PAs (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b).<br/> <br/> Human-bear conflicts, both crop raiding and bear attacks, are a growing concern for this species. Given the aggressive nature of this animal, and the increasing number of encounters between bears and people, these bears are widely feared. Although education may help reduce human-bear conflicts and enhance a conservation ethic among locals, the root of the problem is largely related to the expansion of human settlement and deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of interaction between people and bears. Thus, habitat improvements (government or community-based reforestation) would be helpful in alleviating such conflicts. Potential solutions to this problem have not been studied in depth and further research on this issue is critical to getting this problem under control. The planting of fruit trees, to provide both food and cover, has been undertaken in several states in India.<br/> <br/> Other projects to help ameliorate human-bear conflicts will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human-bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance are likely to be keys to success.<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), India developed a National Conservation Action Plan for bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). This action plan was developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders and covers all four species present in India. The plan emphasizes mitigation of human-bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education. Priority actions in the action plan include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries, creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Capuchins are frugivores-insectivores, including a wide variety of fruits, seeds and arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals, supplemented by stems, flowers and leaves. They are extractive, manipulative foragers. Mean group size for<em> Cebus albifrons</em> is 19.8 individuals, with numbers of males exceeding the numbers of females, adult sex ratio of 1.08 (Fragaszy<em> el al.</em> 2004). Males disperse. Both sexes take up linear hierarchies, the top ranking male being dominant to the top ranking female. Subordinate males are often peripheral (Fragaszy <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is a peak birth season with an 18 month inter-birth interval (Fragaszy<em> et al</em>. 2005). Like other gracile capuchins, shock-headed capuchins prefer middle to upper canopy but can occasionally forage on the ground (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160; Detailed studies on the species’ foraging ecology and behavior are available in Terborgh (1983) and Janson (1986).<br/><br/>Size (<em>Cebus albifrons</em>): Adult male 1.7-3.26 kg (mean 2.49 kg); adult female: 1.4-2.23 kg (mean 1.81 kg) (Ford and Davis 1992).","<p>Across its range, hunting is the major threat to <em>Cebus cuscinus</em>, combined with forest loss and fragmentation.

They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging tree trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1976; Rylands 1984).

Ferrari (1993) states that it is easily distinguished from <em>M. nigriceps</em> (collected on the west bank at the same location) by the lack of pigmentation on the facial skin.

During this period it is estimated that the population has been reduced by at least 80% due both to deforestation and to hunting for bushmeat. Lopes and Ferrari (1993) and Ferrari and Queiroz (1994) concluded that <em>Cebus kaapori</em> is one of the most threatened of all the Amazonian primates. More recently the species was considered one of the most threatened primate species in the world (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2012). A further decline at the same rate is expected to affect this species over the next three generations.,"<em>Cebus kaapori</em> occurs in dense rain forest and deciduous forest environments of Eastern Amazonia. The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats, but it is not tolerant to changes/disturbance in its environment. Recent records from areas close to the coast at Pará State suggest that <em>C. kaapori</em> also uses stretches of mangroves and estuarine floodplain (Silva Jr. <em>et al</em>. 2009, Silva Jr. <em>et al.</em> 2010). Groups observed by Carvalho Jr <em>et al.</em> (1999) ranged in size from 1 to 7 individuals. The species is described as essentially frugivorous, supplementing their diet with arthropods and seeds. In the only study that followed a group throughout the dry season, at the Tucuruí hydroelectric scheme, Goianésia do Pará, the animals used their time mostly ranging (47.4%), feeding (24%) and foraging (15.3%). Time spent resting was only 9%, which is very low for gracile capuchin monkeys, suggesting a dietary stress for this group (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2014).&#160; In the same study, 74% of feeding records were of fruit intake, 13% of insects and 10% of seeds (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2014). The capuchins showed a preference for seven plant species in the study site: <em>Inga alba, Bellucia grossularioides, Attalea maripa, Alchorneopis floribunda, Gustavia augusta, Apeiba burchellii, </em>and <em>Bactris maraja</em> (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; They also ate caterpillars, ants, snails, spiders, wasp nests, honeycombs, and also an unidentified rodent (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). This group used 62 ha, and traveled for an average of 2.1 km/day (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). They used open ombrophylic forest, as well as secondary vegetation, acai palm forest, and riparian forest (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). This study remains the only one to describe in detail the aspects of the natural history of the species (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). Oliveira<em> et al. </em>(2014) found significant dietary overlap between <em>C. kaapori</em> and <em>Sapajus</em> (the robust capuchin), suggesting that sympatric competition with robust capuchins may exacerbate the risk of extinction for <em>C. kaapori</em> in the highly fragmented and anthropogenically disturbed habitats where both remain.<br/><br/><strong>Size: </strong><br/>Paratype. Adult male HB 46.5 cm, TL 51.0 cm, 3.05 kg (Queiroz 1982).","The major threat for the species is habitat loss, as its forests in southern Pará and Maranhão have been extensively destroyed over the last 30 years. It is the region with the highest human population density and the highest level of deforestation and habitat degradation in the entire Brazilian Amazon (Carvalho Jr. <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Gurupí Biological Reserve is the only protected area where the species is known to occur, but the reserve has lost more than half of its forests. Lopes (1993) concluded that selective logging was particularly prejudicial to <em>Cebus kaapori</em> due to the loss of trees providing fruits that are a significant component of its diet. The species is also hunted in the area. Guajá indians also keep them as pets (Queiroz 1992).","Carvalho, Jr. <em>et al.</em> (1999) observed group sizes ranging from 2 to 7 individuals. Oliveira <em>et al. </em>(2014) studied a group of nine individuals in the area of influence of the Tucurui hydroelectric dam.&#160; All field observations and previous abundance estimates suggest low densities for all studied sites, For instance, in Rebio Gurupí, Maranhão, it was found 0.06 groups/10 km (Lopes 1993); in Ranch Cauaxi, Paragominas, Pará, 0.99 groups/10 km or 5.49 ind./10km (Carvalho Jr. <em>et al.</em> 1999); in Ranch Amanda, Viseu, Pará, 0.28 sightings/10 km (Pereira 2002) and in Rio Capim, Goianésia, Pará 0.16-0.19 groups/10 km (Camargo<em> et al.</em> 2007). Lopes (1993) detected three groups in a 480 km survey inside the Gurupí Biological Reserve. Twenty years afterwards, Buss <em>et al. </em>(2014) found 0.25 groups/10 km. Densities estimates for the species in Rebio Gurupí, Maranhão, were also recorded from 0.2 to 0.98 ind./km² (Ferrari and Lopes 1996, Lopes and Ferrari 1996).<br/>The remaining total population size is not known, and neither is it known if the number of mature individuals of this species is greater than 10,000.

There is what would appear to be a natural hybrid zone with <em>Callithrix flaviceps</em>, at the Serra do Brigadeiro, Carangola, in south-eastern Minas Gerais (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1993, Cosenza 1993, Cosenza and Melo 1998).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from other Neotropical primates by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth on either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births.

Despite this, gum is an important part of their diet all year round, and largely obtained from sites where it is available without requiring gouging (Muskin 1984a, b; Coimbra-Filho 1991; Corrêa 1995; Ferrari <em>et al.</em> 1996; Martins and Setz 2000). Martins (2000) recorded them foraging on army ant (Eciton burchelli) swarms. Notable for this species is its consumption of fungi, otherwise recorded only in <em>Callimico goeldii.</em> They find the fruiting bodies of fungi on the stems of bamboo species (<em>Merostachys</em> spp.) and the South American mountain bamboo (<em>Chusquea</em> spp.), both of the family Poaceae.<br/>Size:Female weight: 400-450 g (Garber 1992); Male weight: 400-450 g (Garber 1992)","The widespread destruction of forests within this marmoset's range, especially along the valley of the Rio Paraiba and in the lowland forests is a major threat to this species (Coimbra-Filho 1986b; Brandão and Develey 1998). It might still remain in some areas of the lowland forest of Rio de Janeiro (Mambucaba, Angra dos Reis), but is considered extinct in lowland forests of São Paulo State (Brandão and Develey 1998). <br/><br/><em>Callithrix aurita</em> faces competition from other invasive marmosets (Pereira 2006, 2010, Melo and Rylands 2008, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2008, Port-Carvaho and Kierulff 2009, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bechara 2012,&#160; Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2013, Carvalho 2015, Melo <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nunes 2015, Goncalves 2016), as well as hybridization with several of its congeners (Pereira 2010, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2011, Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2013, Carvalho 2015). <br/><br/>The species is sometimes captured for the pet trade. <br/><br/>It is possible that introduced <em>Callithrix jacchus</em> and<em> Callithrix penicillata </em>have competed, and are still competing with and displacing this species, particularly in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Many non-native <em>Callithrix</em> are also interbreeding with <em>C. aurita</em> resulting in hybridization, although the extent of this threat needs further investigation.In the state of Rio de Janeiro, these threats are considered quite intense. Based on studies by Pereira (2006, 2010) and Pereira <em>et al</em>. (2008),<em> C. aurita</em> is certainly at a critical stage of extinction risk, especially due to the introduction of <em>C. penicillata</em>, <em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>Callithrix hybrids</em> into protected areas where <em>C. aurita</em> occurs.In the state of São Paulo, the risk of hybridization and competition with exotic, invasive species is also extremely worrying, but there is still no accurate diagnosis of the current situation. In the Serra da Cantareira, invaders and hybrids are both present particularly in the area surrounding PE Cantareira, a situation that did not prevail 10 years ago (M. Port-Carvalho, unpubl. data).","<em>Callithrix aurita</em> is nowhere common, and populations in the National Parks of Bocaina and Serra dos Orgãos are small (Coimbra-Filho 1984). Nine months of surveys in the Carlos Botelho State Park in the Serra do Paranapiacaba, in the south of its range, failed to provide any evidence for the survival of this marmoset (Paccagnella 1991; see also Torres de Assumpção 1983). Although recorded as rare in the Itatiaia National Park by Ávila-Pires and Gouveia (1977), Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (1982) reported it to be extinct there. It may still occur in much reduced numbers according to Coimbra-Filho (1986b). It is extremely rare in the private reserve of the Fazenda Barreiro Rico (3,259 ha of forest), São Paulo. Milton and Lucca (1984) estimated no more than 8-12 animals in the entire area.<br/><br/>Other recorded density estimates include: 15 individuals/km² at the Fazenda Barreiro Rico, São Paulo (Torres de Assumpção 1983); 0.02-0.08 individuals/km² in the Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais (Stallings and Robinson 1991); and 20-23 individuals/km² in the Serra do Mar State Park (esp. Núcleo Cunha), São Paulo (Corrêa 1995). Currently, it is estimated that the size of the remaining total population is 176 subpopulations (Bechara 2012), with the number of mature individuals of this taxon being greater than 10,000. The species has suffered severe population decline, due to the loss and fragmentation of their habitat, as demonstrated by Bechara (2012), which showed a reduction of approximately 43% in this marmoset's area of occupancy (AOO) within 18 years. The population decline estimated for the species is intensified by competition and hybridization with invasive species, like <em>C. penicillata</em> and<em> C. jacchus</em>, and hybrids of the genus <em>Callithrix</em>. Thus, it is suspected that the reduction of <em>C. aurita</em> populations is at least 50% over the last 18 years.",Decreasing,"<em>Callithrix aurita</em> occurs in the montane rain forests of  south-eastern Brazil, in the southern part of the state of Minas Gerais,  the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the East and North-east of the state  of São Paulo (see Coimbra-Filho 1986b, Olmos and Martuscelli 1995,  Brandão and Develey 1998, Ferrari<em> et al</em>. 1996). Hershkovitz  (1977) marks the northern limit in Minas Gerais as the Rio Muriaé, but  it occurs to the north in the Rio Doce State Park in Minas Gerais  (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1982), and hybrids (with <em>C. flaviceps</em>)  have been recorded at Carangola in the Serra do Brigadeiro, Minas  Gerais (Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Mendes 1997a,d; Cosenza and Melo 1998).  Melo and Rylands (2008) described the geographical distribution of this  taxon. The northern boundary of its distribution seems to be the  Piracicaba River, in Minas Gerais; the southern limit is the river Doce.  In the West, it seems to extend to Espinhaço in Minas Gerais, and to  the transition areas of the Cerrado in São Paulo. To the East, in Rio de  Janeiro, the species is limited to the tops of the slopes of the Serra  do Mar, with the exception of the southern state, where <em>C. aurita</em>  can be found almost at sea level.Its southern boundary is still  unknown, because the great mass of Paranapiacaba in Sao Paulo can house  relict populations, as well as <em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> (Lima <em>et al.</em>  2003). Hershkovitz (1977) indicated the south-easternmost locality to  be the Rio Ribeira de Iguapé in São Paulo. However, Olmos and  Martuscelli (1995) failed to find evidence for this. They reported that  extensive fieldwork (1982-1995) in such localities as the Fazenda  Intervales State Park, Alto Ribeira State Park, Ilha do Cardoso and  Carlos Botelho, and the Jureia Ecological Station and the muncipalities  of Juquitiba amd Miracatú in the Serra da Paranapicaba consistently  failed to find <em>C. aurita</em>. They proposed the southern limit to  be near the city of São Paulo, north of the junction of the Rios  Pinheiros and Tietê. The Rio Tieté forms the southernmost boundary and  the most southerly record is close to Ipanema (23º26’S, 47º36’W), today  Araçoiaba da Serra (the type locality for<em> Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em>).  From there it extends west between the upper reaches of the Rios  Tieté/Piracicaba. Again the exact limits are unclear, but believed to be  the junction of these two rivers (Olmos and Martusecelli 1995).<br/><br/>Brandão and Develey (1998) carried out surveys to better understand the range of <em>C. aurita</em>.  Although generally believed to be largely montane in its range  (600-1,200 m asl) according to Olmos and Martuscelli (1995), and  (500-800 m asl) according to Rylands (1994), museum specimens have been  collected on the foothills of the Serra do Mar, south of Rio de Janeiro  (Pedra Blanca, municipality of Paratí at 80 m asl, and Mambucaba,  municipality of Angra dos Reis at 100 m asl; Brandão and Develey 1998).  Coimbra-Filho (1991) and Mendes (1993) also indicated that it occurred  elsewhere in lowland Rio de Janeiro, including the North-east, but is  probably today extinct there. All recent records are montane. Brandão  and Develey (1998) carried out extensive surveys of the lowland coastal  forests of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and were unable to obtain  evidence of the species’ existence anywhere except at Mambucaba where  they found one in captivity and observed a group at 165 m asl.<br/><br/>This  marmoset has been recorded north of the Rio Paraíba do Sul at the  following sites: Mogi-Guaçú (Rio Mogi-Guaçú) by R. A. Mittermeier  (unpubl.) and Muskin (1984); Alfenas, upper Rio Grande, in Minas Gerais  (Hershkovitz 1977, Muskin 1984a); Vargem Grande, São Paulo (Muskin  1984a); Fazenda Monte Alegre, Monte Belo, Minas Gerais (Muskin 1984a)  and in the vicinity of Viçosa, Minas Gerais (Mendes 1993); Serra do  Capanema, Rio de Janeiro (21º03’S, 42º03’W) (Mendes 1993), Fazenda João  Abdo, Rio de Janeiro (21º27’S, 41º56’W) (Mendes 1993). The westernmost  locality shown by Hershkovitz (1977) is Boracéia, north-east of Bauru,  on the upper Rio Tieté (22°10'S, 48°45'W), but Olmos and Martuscelli  (1995) found this to be an outlier and suggested that this locality  actually refers to the Boracéia Biological Station near the headwaters  of the Rio Tietê.Recent <em>C. aurita</em> records have been published, in the northwest of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Bergallo <em>et al</em>.  2009a,b;. D. Pereira, unpubl. data) and in enclaves of Cerrado in São  Paulo and in the southern and southeastern areas of Minas Gerais  (Bechara 2012). More samples to define the southern distributional limit  are required. Regions such as the great mass of Paranapiacaba and the  south bank of the Tiete River in Sao Paulo are areas of potential local  occurrence of this taxon (Melo and Rylands 2008).<br/><em></em>",The species is sometimes captured for the pet trade.,Terrestrial,"<em>Callithrix aurita</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Although declines need to be considered over a period of 45 years (three generations), the species is more of a habitat generalist than other species with similar life-histories. However, the species is declining in some parts of its range, especially due to hunting and this combined with a reduced area of distribution.</p>","<p>This species inhabits nearly all types of Amazonian lowland and submontane forest.<br/><br/>Capuchins are frugivores-insectivores, including a wide variety of fruits, seeds and arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals in their diet, supplemented by stems, flowers and leaves. They are extractive, manipulative foragers (see Struhsaker and Leland 1977, Izawa 1979).&#160;</p><p>Mean group size is 18 individuals, with numbers of females exceeding the numbers of males (adult sex ratio of 0.85). Males disperse. Both sexes make up linear hierarchies, the top-ranking male being dominant to the top-ranking female. Subordinate males are often peripheral (Fragaszy <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p><p>Size: Adult male 1.35-4.8 kg (mean 3.05 kg); adult female: 1.76-3.4 kg (mean 2.4 kg) (Jack 2007).</p>","<p>The species is hunted for food and for pets (among the most common primate kept as pets). The release of pet<em> S. a. margaritae</em> back into the wild is another threat for these primates (Martinez <em>et al. </em>2000). Such releases must be considered in terms of the level of risk of disease transmission and hybridization. In Peru, Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reported that hunting has led to its extirpation in areas around human settlements. The species is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urban/human population expansion.</p>","<p>The species is widespread and common, though it is suspected that populations are decreasing.<br/><br/>Population density of the Margarita Island Capuchin has yet to be properly estimated. Results of an ongoing project about ecology and conservation of the Margarita Island Capuchin will allow the determination of densities in the near future. According to Sanz and Marquez (1994), total population is only 250-300 animals. Marquez and Sanz (1991) estimated between 0.02 and 0.23 groups/hours of observation in different forest fragments. Group size was 4.5 ind/group in average. During surveys conducted in 2007, group size varied between 2 and 15 individuals (N. Ceballos-Mago, direct observation).<br/><br/>In Tinigua National Park, Stevenson <em>et al.</em> (1992) recorded a density for <em>Sapajus apella</em> of 16 individuals/km² and, later Stevenson (2007) estimated a density of 27 individuals/km² (Stevenson 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>Freese (1975, 1977) estimated the population density in the Manu National Park to be 36 individuals/km², and similar densities (40 individuals/km²) were found by Terborgh (1983, Terborgh and Janson 1985, Janson 1985a,b).<br/><br/>Further population densities estimates have been published as follows: Gallery forest in El Tuparro National Park, Colombia - 15-17 individuals/km² (Defler and Pintor 1985); Pacaya-Samiria, Peru - 8-10 individuals/km² (Soini 1986); Estación Biológica de Caparú, Colombia - 8 individuals/km² (Defler 2004); Río Puré, Colombia - 5.8 individuals/km² (Defler 2004); Samiria basin, Peru - 24 individuals/km² (Freese 1975, 1977). In Brazil, group size variesfrom 7 to &#160;21 individuals (Peres 1988a, Izawa 1980). The following are density estimates in different sites: 14.6 ind/km² and 24.11 ind/km² in Carauari, AM; 0.71 ind/km² in Coarí, AM; 6.84 ind/km² in Tefé, AM; 6.73 ind./km² in Sena Madureira, AC (Peres 1988a); 8.62 ind/km² in FLOES do Antimary, AC and 8.95 ind/km² in Fazenda Bela Esperança, AC (Calouro 2005); 1.38 ind/km² and 8.18 ind/km² in Lago Mamori, AM and 6.61 ind/km² (Vulinec <em>et al</em>. 2006); 0.19 groups/10 km survey TI Campinas/Katukina (Calouro 2007), 0.27 groups/10 km survey Reserva Florestal Humaitá (Botelho <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This is a wide-ranging species in the lower Amazon.
