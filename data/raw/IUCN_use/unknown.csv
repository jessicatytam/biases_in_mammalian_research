It is gregarious and lives in groups of up to 50 animals (Johnson 2008).,"There appear to be no major threats to this species, although land clearing has probably resulted in the loss of suitable habitat and certainly has been responsible for range contraction at the southern end of its range. This species is commercially harvested in Queensland.","This species is common, but patchily distributed.

It&#160;has a fragmented distribution comprising one native subpopulation and a tiny introduced subpopulation. It has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 22 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) of around 5 km². The entire population within its small native range is considered to occur in only one location as it is all under threat from hunting, and it is experiencing a decline in area, extent and quality of habitat  associated with a causeway construction and increased disturbance from  local people and invasive mammals.<br/><p></p>",The species is found exclusively in Red Mangrove (<em>Rhizophora mangle</em>) where there is no firm ground&#160;(Borroto-Páez and Mancina 2011). It builds communal shelters in mangrove trees (Nowak 1999).,"The primary threat to this species is hunting; the species is accidentally captured in traps designed to catch the larger Desmarest's Hutia (<em>Capromys pilorides</em>) by fisherman who frequent the islands&#160;(Borroto-Páez <em>et al</em>. 2011). There is some level of competition with the introduced Black Rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>), which is abundant in the area and shares refuges with <em>Mesocapromys angelcabrerai</em> (Borroto-Páez 2013);&#160;however, the extent of this threat is unknown. A recently built causeway from the mainland to the Cayos Salinas has damaged mangrove habitat and has enabled increased access for local people, who might also cause fires, and invasive predators and competitors.&#160;The increase in sea level and frequency of hurricanes has the potential to destroy mangrove forest habitat and could affect the species (Borroto-Páez <em>et al.</em> 2011).","<p>The total population has around 750 individuals (based on a count of 190 refuges with each one estimated to have four individuals) and the population could be considered as stable in recent times. The population on the island Cayo la Loma, where six individuals were introduced in 2005,  is estimated at 20 individuals (Borroto-Páez <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), however this area has not been surveyed recently and may no longer be present. </p>",Unknown,"This species is endemic to Cuba. Despite previous reports, it has never been recorded on the Júcaro coast (Borroto-Páez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).

22190005,10300,Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.","The species occurs only in habitat close to water including marshes, estuaries, and along rivers and streams (Eisenberg and Redford 1999). Depending on habitat and hunting pressure, they are found singly or socially. They are diurnal or nocturnal depending on hunting pressure and the season (Eisenberg and Redford 1999). In Venezuela and the Brazilian Pantanal, the species breeds throughout the year, usually with a single breeding cycle. Gestation lasts up to 120 days after which an average of 3.5 young are born (range, one to seven), the peak birth period is during February in the Brazilian Pantanal (Eisenberg and Redford 1999). They live in large groups of extended family members, with group size varying from 2 to 30 individuals with one dominant breeding male. The mating system is one of resource defence polygyny, where males defend access to foraging resources associated with bodies of water (Lacher 2016).","The primary threat is hunting for meat and leather, but there are a number of captive populations that have reduced demand; however some local&#160;populations have been extirpated (Eisenberg and Redford 1999).&#160;Capybara leather is valued in South America and from 1976 to 1979 almost 80,000 skins were exported from Argentina (Eisenberg and Redford 1999). There is a large internal market for the skins. In Peru and Bolivia some Capybaras are hunted and used for bait (Guizada-Duran and Aliaga-Rossel 2014).","It is locally common and widespread, but uncommon or rare in populated areas of the Amazon (Emmons and Feer 1999). Populations in the rainforest are small and narrowly restricted to open watersides (Emmons and Feer 1999). Home range size is dependent upon the quality of habitat, and can vary from 10 ha in resource rich areas to over 200 ha in more resource poor areas.&#160;In the Brazilian Pantanal, densities can reach 15 animals per hectare (Lacher 2016). In some areas of Bolivia the species are abundant however in the central distribution their numbers are declining (an estimation of 0.4 to 0.59 ind./km) with small groups of one to seven maximum individuals (Guizada-Duran and Aliaga-Rossel 2014).",Stable,"This species has a broad distribution that spans east of the Andes in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, the Guyanas, all of Brazil, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northwestern and eastern Argentina (Lacher 2016).",The Capybara is hunted for its leather.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),The species occurs in many protected areas throughout its range.,Neotropical,,false,false,Global
45198149,8994,Genetta abyssinica,Data Deficient,,2016,2016-02-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Data Deficient because there is little current information on the population status and trends of this species, its exact distribution, or possible threats. Although the species has been previously collected or sighted in various habitats and over a wide altitudinal range within its estimated large distribution (<em>ca</em>&#160;500,000 km²), some reports indicated that it is very uncommon or even rare. Of several faunal studies in the core range of this species (Ethiopia) over the past two decades, perhaps only one recorded this species. Other sightings or other forms of records might exist but have not been reported, or individuals might have been misidentified as other species, notably Common Genet (<em>Genetta genetta</em>). The species could warrant listing as Least Concern if it is indeed more abundant than currently known. Conversely, Ethiopian Genet might be widespread but extremely rare, naturally highly localised, or restricted to specific habitat 'pockets' or 'refugia' which have not yet been affected by some potentially expanding threat(s). Surveys are urgently needed to clearly establish the distribution, abundance, possible (micro-)habitat preferences and threats to this species.","Although the habitat requirements of this species are not well known, it appears to have a wide altitudinal and ecological range, from coastal plains and open dry lowlands to montane heather moorlands and Afroalpine grasslands (Gaubert 2013). Diaz Behrens and Van Rompaey (2002) provide records of this species in montane dry forest where dominant species include Tree Heath (<em>Erica arborea</em>), Curry Bush (<em>Hypericum revolutum</em>) and Abyssinian Rose (<em>Rosa abyssinica</em>). Haltenorth and Diller (1980) stated that the Ethiopian Genet is sometimes found near urban areas, but the original basis for this&#160;statement was not given, and it&#160;could be because of confusion with Common Genet (<em>Genetta genetta</em>) and/or wrong assumptions from market sellers.","<p>Some Ethiopian Genet skins bought in Addis Abeba markets before the 1970s are kept in the Berlin Museum. It is unknown whether this species's skins are still sold in current days, and if so, volumes and geographic spread of trade would be equally unknown. Felling and cultivation in <em>Acacia</em> woodland and thornbush, together with pressures of herds of domestic stock in both arid lowlands and high plateaux, occur in Ethiopia (Yalden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996)&#160;and might—depending on its precise habitat use—threaten this species.&#160;The species’s natural history is too poorly known to identify which other potential threats are likely to affect it.</p>","<p>The current population status is not known, but the species is evidently rare (Gaubert 2013). Yalden <em>et al.</em> (1996) considered it very uncommon. Known from fewer than 20 museum specimens, a small number of direct observations (Diaz Behrens and Van Rompaey 2002) and some skins in village possession (Diaz Behrens and Van Rompaey 2002) and sold in markets (P. Gaubert pers. obs. 2003–2004).</p>",Unknown,"Patchily recorded in Ethiopia, northern Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti and south-eastern Sudan (Yalden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Gaubert 2013, A. Ferguson pers. comm. 2016). It has an estimated range of <em>ca</em>&#160;500,000 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;Diaz Behrens and Van Rompaey (2002) convincingly documented the presence of the species up to 3,750 m a.s.l. in the Abune Yosef massif, in Ethiopia. It occurs down to sea-level (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996).",There are records of Ethiopian Genet skins sold on Addis Abeba market before the Second World War (unknown use; P. Gaubert pers. obs. 2003–2004). It is unknown whether Ethiopian Genets are currently killed and their skins sold on markets.,Terrestrial,"<p>In Ethiopia, the Abune Yosef massif lies within a proposed biosphere reserve (Saavedra 2009). It has been suggested that only three National Parks are likely to support populations of the Ethiopian Genet: Yangudi-Rassa, Awash and Simien Mountains (Gaubert 2013), although the species’s natural history is too poorly known for a high confidence in this assessment. There is an urgent need for further survey work to generate a better understanding of the distribution, habitat requirements and population status of, and threats to, the species, so that its conservation needs, if any, can be determined.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
45220840,44165,Poiana leightoni,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2015-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"West African Oyan is listed as Vulnerable based on a likely total population of 6,700–10,000 mature individuals (roughly estimated based on a range area of <em>ca</em> 50,000 km², an average population density highly unlikely to exceed 2–3 individuals/10 km², and a proportion of mature individuals of 67%) and a likely population&#160;decline of at least 10% over the last 12 years (assuming a generation length of four years) based on the loss of habitat within its range in the upper Guinea forests, combined with the impacts of hunting.","An inhabitant of the rainforest canopy (Van Rompaey and Colyn 2013), where it apparently builds nests at a height of at least&#160;2 m above the ground in which to sleep during the day (H.-J. Kuhn <em>in</em> Nowak 1999).","Like Johnston's Genet (<em>Genetta johnstoni</em>),&#160;Bourlon's Genet (<em>G. bourloni</em>)&#160;and Liberian Mongoose (<em>Liberiictis kuhni</em>), this species is believed to be affected by ongoing habitat loss in the upper Guinean forests, possibly more so given that it is a canopy species. It is unclear to what degree this semi-arboreal species is impacted by bushmeat hunting, but this could be a threat since most of the specimens collected during field expeditions were acquired from hunters.","There is no reliable information on the population status of this species.&#160;Apparently it is rare and very localised (Rosevear 1974).&#160;The most recent confirmed records are&#160;from Liberia in the late 1980s (Taylor 1992), but no serious search effort has been undertaken since then. The species has apparently not been reported from bushmeat markets over the past 25 years; this might reflect the limited number of surveys within and around its known range and/or the fact that the arboreal behaviour of this species takes it out of the range of most of the hunting effort.",Decreasing,"West African Oyan is endemic to West Africa. It is confirmed only in south-western Côte d’Ivoire, where it is known from two records; and in eastern Liberia, where there are several records (Van Rompaey and Colyn 2013). The presence of this species in the Kounounkan Massif in south-western Guinea (Barnett <em>et al.</em> 1996) requires confirmation (Van Rompaey and Colyn 2013). There is no confirmed record of the species from Sierra Leone.","Specimens have been collected from hunters, but it is unclear whether this species is used as bushmeat, for its pelt or in traditional medicine.",Terrestrial,"It may occur in the Sangbé National Park (NP) in Côte d’Ivoire (Hoppe-Dominik 1990) and the type locality is not far away from the northern boundary of Liberia’s Sapo NP (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). This is a priority species for further survey work, particularly to determine its current range and population status, whether or not it is subject to damaging levels of&#160;hunting, and to investigate other aspects of its ecology. It is presently too poorly known to define relevant conservation needs.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
