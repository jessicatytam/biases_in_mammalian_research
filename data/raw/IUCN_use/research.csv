2782611,22563,Tursiops truncatus,Vulnerable,A2cde,2012,2009-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This subpopulation qualifies for listing as Vulnerable based on criterion A2cde.<br/><br/>Generation time for this species is estimated as 23 years (Taylor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Therefore, three generations from 2009 would go back or forward 69 years, to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ca</span>. 1940 and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ca</span>. 2078, respectively.<br/><br/>In northern portions of the Mediterranean basin, there is a well-known history of intentional killing, including extensive extermination campaigns conducted until at least the early 1960s, and there has been (and continues to be) substantial incidental mortality in fishing gear (A2d). It is not possible, however, to make robust estimates of either kind of mortality for other than short time periods and limited areas within the total subpopulation range. There is strong evidence that overfishing of dolphin prey has resulted in a form of habitat loss and degradation and likely also in a decline in area of occupancy (A2c). Other factors, such as disturbance by marine traffic, may be contributing to those processes. High levels of contamination by pollutants are another source of concern (A2e). Of the identified threats, only the extermination campaigns have ceased.<br/><br/>According to literature from the 19th century, “dolphins” were abundant throughout Mediterranean coastal waters. On the northern side of the basin, the animals were mostly seen as vermin, and one of the main concerns of fishery managers from the late 18th century onwards was to develop and deploy new means of killing the largest possible number of dolphins. Conflict with fisheries was reportedly acute in several areas of Spain (A. Aguilar, pers. comm.), France, Italy, and former Yugoslavia (today’s Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro), where thousands of animals were killed for bounties (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). Bottlenose and Common Dolphins were the main targets of the extermination campaigns in Mediterranean coastal areas. Numbers of Bottlenose Dolphins in some areas where they were formerly high are now lower, and this pattern can reasonably be extrapolated to other areas in the northern part of the basin. Given this, a reduction in population size of more than 30% since 1940 is suspected. Thus, the main drivers to justify a listing of Vulnerable are (a) the extensive extermination campaigns in the northern part of the western basin that ceased in the 1960s followed by (b) more recent bycatch in fisheries and prey depletion in a number of areas as well as generalized deterioration in quality of habitat (see ‘Threats’ section). It is suspected that even though substantial recovery may have occurred as the culling came to an end several decades ago, the other threats that have developed and increased in recent decades have either kept numbers down or slowed recovery so that the population is still at least 30% below its 1940 level. This extrapolation from a small number of areas to the rest of the Mediterranean, for much of which there is little or no information on the status of Bottlenose Dolphins, represents a precautionary rather than evidentiary interpretation of evidence. As explained in the March 2010 Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, version 8.0 (sections 3.2.3, 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 in particular), assessors are encouraged to ‘adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude, and to resist an evidentiary attitude to uncertainty when applying the criteria’.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Note on population structure</span>: although this listing treats the Bottlenose Dolphins throughout the entire Mediterranean Sea as a single unit, separate subpopulations probably exist in some areas, e.g., the Adriatic Sea, where the species has declined dramatically (quite likely by at least 50%) over the past 50 years (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2008). Other geographically distinct subpopulations are known to reside within relatively small semi-closed basins such as the Amvrakikos Gulf in western Greece (400 km²), where they exhibit specialized behaviour and feeding habits (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008a). Therefore, the listing of Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins as a single subpopulation should not be interpreted to mean there is no further subpopulation structure within the region.","<p>Bottlenose Dolphins in the Mediterranean are often regarded as predominantly ‘coastal’ or ‘inshore’ animals but this designation may be misleading as they can be encountered in continental shelf and shallow plateaux waters at any distance from the coast (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). They inhabit a wide variety of habitats including continental shelf waters, lagoons and enclosed seas, and the waters surrounding islands and archipelagos (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Alborán and Balearic Seas they occur across the entire shelf, along the shelf edge and in deep waters of the continental slope, and in productive waters 200–500 m deep (Cañadas <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2005, Forcada <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Strait of Gibraltar, at or near the western limits of what is defined here as the Mediterranean region, Bottlenose Dolphins occur mainly in water 200–600 m deep, over steep slopes (de Stephanis <em>et al.</em> 2008). In Greek waters they are found in coastal areas, straits, gulfs, semi-closed eutrophic waters, and steep coasts with no continental shelf (Frantzis <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2008).<br/></p><p>  </p><p>The size of Bottlenose Dolphin groups varies according to biogeographic region, prey availability, activity and other factors. Most encounters have been with groups of fewer than ten individuals (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Associations with other cetacean species are uncommon, although in some areas mixed aggregations with Short-beaked Common Dolphins (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Delphinus delphis</span>) and Long-finned Pilot Whales (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Globicephala melas</span>) have been observed (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/></p>  <p>In Mediterranean coastal waters Bottlenose Dolphins target primarily demersal prey during feeding sessions characterized by dives lasting 3–5 min and occasionally up to 8 min, depending on water depth (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Reported prey items include demersal species such as European Hake (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Merluccius merluccius</span>), European Conger (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Conger conger</span>), Red Mullet (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mullus barbatus</span>), Striped Red Mullet (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mullus surmuletus</span>), Common Cuttlefish (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sepia officinalis</span>), Common Octopus (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Octopus vulgaris</span>) and a variety of other bony fishes and molluscs (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). As most studies have relied on stomach contents from stranded animals, inferences may be subject to bias (Barros and Clarke 2002). In some Mediterranean areas Bottlenose Dolphins also feed on Clupeidae or other epipelagic prey (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/></p>  In the Mediterranean Sea, predation is regarded as a minor cause of mortality. Bottlenose Dolphins, as well as other small Mediterranean delphinids, are preyed upon occasionally by sharks, principally Great White Sharks (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Carcharodon carcharias</span>) but also several other species (Fergusson 1994, Morey <em>et al</em>. 2003). The numbers of large sharks have declined drastically in Mediterranean waters over the past century (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008) and this may have reduced predation pressure considerably.&#160; Other potential dolphin predators<em>,</em> such as the Killer Whale (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Orcinus orca</span>) and the False Killer Whale (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pseudorca crassidens</span>), are rare in the Mediterranean (Notarbartolo di Sciara 1987, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).","Owing to their occurrence in coastal waters, Bottlenose Dolphins in the Mediterranean are exposed to a wide variety of human activities. Whilst intentional killing was likely the most important cause of mortality until the 1960s (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2008), important ongoing threats include incidental mortality in fishing gear and the reduced availability of key prey caused by region-wide overfishing and environmental degradation. Additional potential or likely threats include the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals, epizootic outbreaks, direct disturbance from boating and shipping, noise, and the consequences of climate change. It is worth noting that this same array of known and potential threats applies to riverine, estuarine and coastal cetaceans in many other parts of the world as well (e.g., Reeves <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fishery-related mortality</span><br/>Due to their opportunistic behaviour and predominantly coastal occurrence, Bottlenose Dolphins in the Mediterranean are at risk of entanglement in many types of fishing gear. In addition to incidental mortality, depredation and damage caused by dolphins to fishing gear may result in animals being shot or harassed in retaliation (Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994). Incidental mortality of Bottlenose Dolphins has been reported from Algeria, Croatia, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, and Turkey (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Bycatch in set nets reportedly is frequent in coastal waters throughout the basin (Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994, Díaz López 2006, Brotons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Significant mortality also was reported in pelagic driftnets off Morocco, Spain, Malta, Italy and Turkey (Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994, Di Natale 1995). Few attempts have been made to assess the impact of fishery-related mortality on local populations of Bottlenose Dolphins, and the actual magnitude of bycatch and retaliation events is unknown in most cases (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). However, the available studies and circumstantial evidence for local populations raise serious concern, suggesting that annual fishery-induced mortality is locally unsustainable in at least some cases (e.g. Brotons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Data from strandings can be informative with regard to the occurrence and relative scale of bycatch. Along the Italian coasts in the years 1986–2005, Bottlenose Dolphins were the second most numerous species classified as bycaught after the Striped Dolphin (301 and 71 records, respectively; Podestà 2007). Of 694 Bottlenose Dolphins stranded in Italy during the same period, 71 (11%) showed signs of bycatch (Podestà 2007). Of a total of 21 Bottlenose Dolphins stranded in France in 2003, eight reportedly had been bycaught (Dhermain 2003). Signs included specimens gutted, missing peduncles or fins, obvious net scars, and/or ropes tied to the tails. These percentages are likely underestimates, considering that the majority of the remaining carcasses were in an advanced state of decomposition and therefore signs, if present, would not necessarily have been observable. Bycatch in trawl nets appears to be infrequent in most Mediterranean areas, but may be locally significant. For instance, of 67 Bottlenose Dolphins found dead stranded or adrift along the coasts of Israel between 1993 and 2004, 26 (39%) were judged to have been taken in trawl nets (Feingold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). Bottlenose Dolphins have not been reported entangled in fish farm gear in the Mediterranean, except when anti-predator nets (mesh size 15 cm) are deployed (Díaz López and Bernal Shirai 2007). The overall frequency of intentional killing (see ‘Past culling campaigns’) has drastically declined over the years, due in part to protective legislation in most Mediterranean countries. However, targeted kills still occur in certain areas (e.g. Tudela 2004, Gazo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In addition to killing in retaliation for damage to fisheries, killing with harpoons or guns for local consumption of meat was reported as recently as the early 1990s in the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas, notwithstanding legal protection (Di Natale 1991, Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994). Such occurrences seem to have become rare in more recent times. The illegal use of dynamite for fishing in several Mediterranean areas (e.g. Reynolds <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Tudela 2004) represents another fishery-related threat to Bottlenose Dolphins. Though impact at the basin level is probably low, it may be significant locally and a few Bottlenose Dolphin deaths suspected to have been caused by explosives have been reported.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Prey depletion</span><br/>Overfishing is having profound direct and indirect impacts on Mediterranean ecosystems (Sala 2004) and it has contributed significantly to dramatic ecological changes, including decline of dolphins and other megafauna (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008) and caused the decline of many fish stocks (Caddy and Griffiths 1990, De Walle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1993, Stanners and Bourdeau 1995, Garcia <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). Some of the Mediterranean fish stocks that have been either ‘overexploited’ or ‘fully exploited’ include important bottlenose dolphin prey (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, 2010). Reduced carrying capacity (i.e., fewer prey available) due to overfishing was proposed as one explanation for the low densities of Bottlenose Dolphins in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Conversely, Bottlenose Dolphin densities tend to be high in areas where prey is still abundant (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Contamination by xenobiotics</span><br/>Contaminant levels, particularly of organochlorine compounds, in Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins are very high compared to the levels reported for Bottlenose Dolphins in some other areas (Corsolini <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Marsili and Focardi 1997, Aguilar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Fossi and Marsili 2003, Wafo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, Borrell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Borrell and Aguilar 2007, Storelli <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). At concentrations similar to or lower than those documented for Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins, compounds such as PCBs or PAHs have been associated with reproductive disorders, immune-system suppression and neoplasia (Lahvis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Reddy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Schwacke <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Jaber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, Hall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Although organochlorine contamination is decreasing in some areas, levels in Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins remain high (Tolosa <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997, Aguilar and Borrell 2004, Borrell and Aguilar 2007, Storelli <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Monitoring of toxic chemicals, risk assessment and intervention protocols therefore represent important precautionary measures (Schwacke <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Fossi and Marsili 2003, Jaber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, Porte <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Various and sometimes high levels of heavy metals have been found in stranded bottlenose dolphins from the Mediterranean (e.g. Leonzio <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1992, Frodello <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Roditi-Elasar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Lahaye <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).&#160; The effects of these metals at the population level are unknown.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Epizootic outbreaks</span><br/>Epizootic outbreaks appear to have affected Bottlenose Dolphins to a lesser extent than other Mediterranean delphinids, such as the Striped Dolphin (Aguilar and Raga 1993, Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1993). Morbillivirus infections have been reported in a Bottlenose Dolphin stranded on the Mediterranean coast of Israel in 1994 (Tsur <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997) and another stranded in Mauritania (Atlantic coast of West Africa) in 1988 (Van de Bildt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). Bottlenose Dolphins elsewhere have experienced mass mortality from such outbreaks, e.g. in Black Sea waters (Birkun <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998, Birkun, 2006) and on the Atlantic coast of the United States, where more than half of one local population may have died (Lipscomb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Duignan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Schulman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997).&#160; As epizootic phenomena may be related to immune-system compromise induced by exposure to xenobiotics and/or by stress from poor nutrition (Aguilar and Borrell 1994, Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, O’Shea and Aguilar 2001), the risk of disease outbreaks in Bottlenose Dolphins in the Mediterranean may be considerable.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Boat traffic and acoustic disturbance</span><br/>There has been a great expansion of recreational boat traffic and shipping in the Mediterranean in recent decades (Dobler 2002) but the potential for resultant behavioural disruption and habitat loss has been investigated only to a limited extent. Permanent or temporary avoidance of one Mediterranean area by Bottlenose Dolphins as a consequence of a large seasonal increase in boat traffic was reported in coastal waters of Croatia (Fortuna 2006). Similar negative effects have been reported from other places around the world (Allen and Read 2000; Lusseau 2004, 2005; Bejder <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). The noise from various human activities in addition to boating/shipping - e.g. seismic surveys, dredging, drilling, underwater explosions, and the use of military or other sonars – is also a cause for concern (Richardson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Nowacek <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Climate change</span><br/>Some of the effects of global warming have become dramatically apparent in recent years (IPCC 2007). Climate change has the potential to affect a range of biological processes and cause significant shifts in marine and other biota (e.g., Peñuelas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Parmesan and Yohe 2003, Diaz-Almela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Increased seawater temperature has been observed in Mediterranean deep (Bethoux <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1990) and surface waters (Metaxas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991, Bethoux and Gentili 1996) and there is increasing evidence of biological responses to such warming (e.g., Francour <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Diaz-Almela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Effects of climate change on cetaceans, often mediated via changes in prey abundance and distribution, have become apparent in several non-Mediterranean areas (Learmonth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simmonds and Isaac 2007) and similar effects may be occurring in Mediterranean waters (Azzellino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Cañadas and Hammond 2006). At present, however, it is impossible to predict the net effect of climate change on Bottlenose Dolphins – either in the Mediterranean Sea or elsewhere.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Live capture</span><br/>The removal of live cetaceans from the wild – whether for captive display, for ‘dolphin-assisted therapy’ (Marino and Lilienfeld 2007) or for research purposes – is equivalent to incidental or deliberate killing, as the animals brought into captivity or killed during capture operations are no longer available to help maintain their wild populations (Reeves <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). ‘Takes’ of Bottlenose Dolphins are prohibited in most Mediterranean riverine States by national legislation or international agreements (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). However, live captures (and any mortality and social disruption associated with capture operations) still occur occasionally (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).","Total population size is unknown but may be in the low 10,000s based on observed densities in areas that have been surveyed (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Further subpopulation structure exists and may require future assessments at a finer geographical scale. Further genetic analysis with samples from areas not yet included are strongly recommended. <br/><br/>A declining trend is inferred, refering specifically to the time since the early 1940s (i.e., over the last three generations). It is uncertain whether the subpopulation is still declining and if so, at what rate.<br/><br/>Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins are genetically differentiated from those inhabiting the contiguous eastern North Atlantic Ocean and Scottish waters.&#160; Based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses, distinct populations have been identified across the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea (Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005). The genetic analysis of 145 samples along a continuous distributional range from the Black Sea to the eastern North Atlantic (16 samples from the Black Sea, 74 from the Mediterranean Sea, 35 from the eastern North Atlantic and 20 from Scotland) found population structure with boundaries that coincided with the transitions between different types of habitat. The different zones can be characterized by ocean floor topography and by features such as surface salinity, productivity and temperature. Five populations were identified: Black Sea, eastern Mediterranean, western Mediterranean, eastern North Atlantic and Scottish. The Black Sea population showed the highest differentiation from other populations. Significant genetic differentiation was observed between populations from the eastern and the western Mediterranean. The boundary between the western Mediterranean and the eastern North Atlantic was the weakest observed, although the two populations still showed significant genetic differentiation.&#160; Despite the lack of obvious physical barriers, the eastern North Atlantic and the Scottish populations also showed genetic differences. There was genetic evidence of directional emigration of females at the extreme of the range although neither sex showed a strong bias for greater dispersal (Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005). Population structure of Bottlenose Dolphins around the Iberian Peninsula was investigated through isotopic signatures and organochlorine pollutant loads in tissues of stranded animals from Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands and adjacent Atlantic waters (Huelva and Portugal; Borrell <em>et al.</em> 2006). Significant differences in stable isotopes of carbon (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) and in PCB congener profiles indicated that dolphins from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean do not intermingle.&#160; In the Mediterranean, dolphins from Catalonia and Valencia were indistinguishable, suggesting a common distribution area. However, dolphins from the Balearic Islands differed from those of mainland Spain in their DDT/PCB ratio and from all the other sample groups in their PCB congener profiles, suggesting that the deep waters between the Balearic Islands and the Peninsula represent an effective barrier for the species (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2006). Evidence of population structure also has been found in other Mediterranean delphinids, including Short-beaked Common Dolphins (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Delphinus delphis</span><em>) </em>(Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2008), Striped Dolphins (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Stenella coeruleoalba</span>) (Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Gaspari <em>et al</em>. 2007b) and Risso’s Dolphins (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Grampus griseus</span>) (Gaspari <em>et al.</em> 2007). These findings suggest not only that the more obvious physical boundaries such as the Strait of Gibraltar (minimum width about 45 km and sill depths less than 145 m) and the Turkish Straits system (Dardanelles minimum width about 450 m and sill depths less than 55 m) represent barriers to the movement of individuals, but also that the much wider Sicily Channel (143 km and sill depths less than 200 m), oceanic features such as the Almería-Orán front (Tintoré <em>et al</em>. 1988) and more generally differences in habitat characteristics tend to limit the movements of Bottlenose Dolphins (Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><p>There is no basin-wide estimate of numbers and the most reliable information comes from a few local studies&#160; (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Useful information on past and present occurrence also comes from stranding records from Algeria, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Morocco, Spain, and Tunisia (however, a stranded carcass is not necessarily indicative of the dead animal’s having lived nearby). Virtually nothing is known for large portions of the south-eastern part of the basin (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008c). Most studies in coastal waters are limited to areas of 400 to 1,000 km² and probably do not even cover the entire ranges of the groups under study.&#160; Relatively recent, broad-scale shipboard surveys (4,000–80,000 km²) showed that in some Mediterranean areas Bottlenose Dolphins are present both near shore and offshore, and densities can range between four and 20 animals per 100 km²<sup></sup> (Ben Naceur <em>et al</em>. 2004, Forcada <em>et al.</em> 2004, Cañadas and Hammond 2006, Gómez de Segura <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008c). Studies tend to focus on areas of relatively high dolphin density, although study site preferences also may depend on logistical and other considerations. Although the total population size in the Mediterranean remains uncertain, it unquestionably exceeds the threshold level for red listing as Vulnerable under the D criterion.</p><p>  </p><p>Indirect but convincing evidence of dolphin abundance in historical times can be found in early accounts describing interactions with fisheries and systematic attempts to exterminate dolphins (including Bottlenose Dolphins) in Mediterranean coastal waters (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/></p>  The only Mediterranean area with quantitative historical information that can be used to infer population trends over time scales of more than a couple of decades is the northern Adriatic Sea. There, Bottlenose Dolphin numbers likely declined by at least 50% in the second half of the 20th century, largely as a consequence of deliberate killing initially, followed by habitat degradation and overfishing of prey species (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2004). For some other parts of the northern Mediterranean, e.g. Italy and southern France, the available information is less precise but suggests similar trends (Blanco and González 1992, Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2000). In an area off southern Spain where the species has been studied intensively, abundance estimates have shown variability but no trend since the early 1990s (Cañadas <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Decreasing,"Bottlenose Dolphins are widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Although historically their distribution may have been continuous, at least in coastal waters, it is now marked by gaps with low densities that may be either natural or the result of anthropogenic effects (e.g., intensive exploitation, whether deliberate or indirect; habitat degradation or loss). Range includes inshore, coastal and offshore waters to near the continental slope.<br/>  <p>Bottlenose Dolphins occur in most coastal waters of the basin and have been reliably reported in the waters of Albania, Algeria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Gibraltar (U.K.), Greece, Israel, Italy, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey.&#160; They occur regularly around many of the region’s offshore islands and archipelagos (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Many of the Mediterranean areas inhabited by these dolphins are subject to intensive human use, e.g. the straits of Gibraltar, Bonifacio, and Messina, and the gulfs of Lion, Genoa, and Trieste. Within their overall range, gaps with very low densities of animals have been documented, e.g., in the north-western Ligurian Sea (France and Italy) and in the north-western Gulf of Vera (Spain). Variation in density is likely related to several factors, including a) habitat characteristics and b) local availability of suitable prey. The effects of past extermination campaigns (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004) and a variety of ongoing threats probably have contributed to the patchiness of the current distribution of Bottlenose Dolphins across the region. </p>","Live cetaceans from the wild are captured for ‘dolphin-assisted therapy’ (Marino and Lilienfeld 2007) or  for research purposes. ‘Takes’ of Bottlenose Dolphins are prohibited in most Mediterranean riverine States by  national legislation or international agreements (Bearzi <em>et al</em>.  2008). However, live captures (and any mortality and social  disruption associated with capture operations) still occur occasionally  (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Marine,"Several of the existing laws and treaties in force today (reviewed in Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008) could provide a potentially solid framework for the conservation of Bottlenose Dolphins and for the protection of their habitat in the Mediterranean region. Unfortunately, implementation and enforcement of those instruments have not been consistently effective. Actions taken to date have not been adequate to maintain a ‘favourable’ status of Bottlenose Dolphin populations (as advocated by the EU Habitats Directive) or to prevent further population decline. Tangible actions to protect Bottlenose Dolphins and other Mediterranean cetaceans have been surprisingly few, especially if one considers the large number of existing laws, regulations and agreements that have been in place for years and even decades (Bearzi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>About a hundred national Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of different types, sizes and purposes have been established in Algeria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Malta, Monaco, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey, but specific measures for cetacean conservation are rarely included in their management plans. A notable exception is the 87,000 km² cetacean sanctuary created in 1999 by France, Italy, and the Monaco Principality in the Corso-Ligurian-Provençal Basin (the ‘Pelagos Sanctuary’; Notarbartolo di Sciara <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In addition, three years of provisional protection (from July 26th, 2006) were granted to the waters east of the islands of Losinj and Cres (Croatia) following a proposal for the creation of a special zoological reserve for dolphins. However, that period has expired and so far no protection measures have been enforced. If appropriately managed, MPAs could contribute to Bottlenose Dolphin conservation by preserving their prey and habitat, reducing the risks of mortality in fishing gear, providing refuge from noise and other types of disturbance, raising awareness, stimulating research and facilitating exchange of information (Hoyt 2005). However, levels of enforcement are often low and many of the existing Mediterranean MPAs merely represent ‘paper parks’ (Bearzi 2007, Guidetti <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Other types of action that can provide direct or indirect benefits to Bottlenose Dolphins include area-, season-, or fishery-specific reductions in fishing effort, changes to fishing gear or fishing practices to reduce incidental mortality, curtailment of inputs of toxic pollutants, and boating regulations.",Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

9203833,20472,Spermophilus citellus,Vulnerable,A2bc,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Spermophilus citellus</em> has shown overall declines of at least 30% across its range in the Mediterranean region and qualifies for Vulnerable (VU A2bc). There are several isolated subpopulations and subspecies that deserve special attention. The subspecies <em>macedonicus</em> in Greece is practically extinct as a result of widespread habitat loss (G. Mitsain pers. comm. 2007), and subspecies <em>gradojevici</em> has very restricted range in Greece and Macedonia. Another isolated subpopulation in Karamani (Macedonia) has an extremely small range (certainly &lt;100 km² and scattered distribution) and deserves particular attention. In Turkish Thrace, habitat destruction is causing serious ongoing declines and the popualtion there should also be closely monitored; it may be close to extinction within the next ten years if declines continue as they are (Yigit, N. pers. comm. 2007). Ground squirrels are very sensitive to habitat changes: conversion and abandonment of short-grass habitats can cause very rapid population declines.","The European souslik has quite specific habitat requirements. It is restricted to short-grass steppe and similar artificial habitats (pastures, lawns, sports fields, golf courses) on light, well-drained soils, where it can excavate its burrows (Kryštufek 1999, Spitzenberger 2002). It avoids cultivated land, with the exception of vineyards in some parts of its range (Spitzenberger 2002). It has an omnivorous diet including seeds, roots, shoots, flowers, and arthropods (Nowak 1999, Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).","The main threats to this species are the conversion of steppe-grassland and pasture to cultivated fields or forestry, and the abandonment of pasture and its subsequent reversion to tall-grass meadows or scrubby habitats which are not suitable for the souslik (Kryštufek 1999). In Austria it is therefore largely restricted to vineyards, airstrips, golflinks, sport- and camping grounds and other frequently mown lawns where it is completely dependent on the toleration of the owners (Spitzenberger 2002). Although not a major threat, some Gypsy communities in central and eastern Europe still catch sousliks for use as a traditional meal (J. Mateju pers. comm. 2006).","The European souslik is currently in serious decline. Its population has become fragmented, and extinctions have occurred in peripheral parts of its range in Germany (where it went extinct c.1985 because of forestry) and Poland (where the last definite autochthonous records date from the 1970s, although the species has recently been reintroduced (Kryštufek 1999, H. Meinig pers. comm. 2006, A. Gondek pers. comm. 2006). Although there are still some large and apparently stable subpopulations, there have been many reports of declines, especially in the north-western part of its range; it is also declining in the southern part of the range. In optimal habitat, densities of 18-48 individuals per hectare have been recorded, although lower figures of 5-14 individuals per hectare are also reported (Kryštufek 1999). In Romania, the population has been estimated at c.15,000 (Botnariuc and Tatole 2005). In parts of Dobrudja (Romania and Bulgaria) populations may have stabilised and started to increase since 1989, as a result of abandonment of intensive agriculture following the fall of the communist regime (I. Coroiu and D. Murariu pers. comm. 2006). In Greece, populations of two subspecies <em>macedonicus</em> and <em>graolojenici</em>) have been lost (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006). <br/><br/>In the Czech Republic there were 83 known localities in 1995, but by 2000-2001 only 26 of them still existed (Cepáková and Hulová 2002). Since 2001, there has been regular monitoring of <em>S. citellus</em>. Five new sites have been found, six colonies have disappeared, one was re-established due to reintroduction and one site has been naturally colonized following conservation  management. Fluctuation or stagnation of abundance has been observed at eleven sites, numbers of sousliks have steadily decreased at seven sites, and only in five colonies have populations increased.

However, over the last ten years the rate of decline has slowed (perhaps to ca. 20%, but no data are currently available to support this figure). Since the population is still declining, albeit at a slower rate, and habitat loss and fragmentation is continuing, the species is assessed as Near Threatened at the global level (approaching A2bc+3bc).","Like its congener the European souslik <em>Spermophilus citellus</em>, the spotted souslik prefers open areas with short grass (including steppes, pastures, and road verges). Unlike the European souslik, it can also sometimes be found on cultivated ground and can survive ploughing (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). It feeds chiefly on grasses and cereals, although arthropods and small vertebrates are also taken.","It is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of appropriate habitats. Causes of habitat loss include expansion of agriculture and forestry, urbanisation, reclamation of wasteland and industrial development (Glowacinski <em>et al.</em> 2001, Piskorski 2005, Z. Glowacinski pers. comm. 2006). More than 50% of the remaining Polish population is threatened by the expansion of Lublin airport (A. Gondek pers. comm. 2006). In some areas, it is persecuted as an agricultural pest. Hybridisation with <em>S. pygmaeus</em> and <em>S. citellus</em> has been recorded, but is not likely to be a major threat. Currently all populations are declining and becoming more fragmented, which makes hybridisation less of a problem.","The spotted souslik has suffered marked declines in both population and range. Its extent of occurrence has contracted in both Poland and southern Russia, and the number of colonies in Poland and the Ukraine (where no more than 10% of the former range described in mid-twentieth century is left) has decreased markedly (Glowacinski <em>et al.</em> 2001, Piskorski 2005, I. Zagorodnyuk pers. comm. 2006). Populations in the southern and eastern parts of the range are more stable. Over the last ten years some populations have shown increases in population size. However, across the global range, the total population is declining, although the rate of decline over the last ten years is likely to be less than 30% (I. Zagorodnyuk pers. comm. 2006). The Polish population of the spotted souslik has been estimated at c.20,000 individuals living in 7 compact and no more than 10 scattered colonies. The most numerous of these colonies, with 10,000-12,000 individuals, is found at Swidnik airport (near Lublin) and is the result of an unofficial introduction in the early 1980s. The present population of <em>S. suslicus</em> is one third of what it was in the 1960s, the number of localities has markedly decreased and the area occupied has shrunk by a half. If this trend continues the souslik will die out in Poland at the first decades of the 21th century (Glowacinski <em>et al.</em> 2001, Piskorski 2005, Z.

There is no indication that the population has declined to an extent that would qualify for a threatened category. Consequently this species is assessed as Least Concern at the European regional level.","The common minke whale occurs in both coastal and offshore waters and exploits a variety of prey species in different areas according to availability.  In the Northern Hemisphere some populations migrate to higher latitudes in summer, but it is also found year-round in some areas.  With the exception of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea- East China Sea population, conception and birth occur in winter.  Most animals occur singly, and few in groups of more than two.  <br/><br/>In the North Atlantic, studies in the Barents and Norwegian Seas show that minke whale diet varies greatly between areas and years, being dominated by krill in the northern areas, but by herring or capelin in other areas according to what is most abundant that year, with gadoids being taken when herring and capelin were scarce (Lindstrøm and Haug 2002).  In the North Sea the diet consisted almost exclusively of sandeel (data from one year only).  Minke whales taken off Iceland in 2003-04 contained mainly sandeel, with some capelin and gadoids (Víkingsson <em>et al.</em> 2006). Minke whales caught off Newfoundland during 1966-72 contained mainly capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1974).<br/><br/>The overlap of the diet of this species with the targets of commercial fisheries poses difficult questions in ecosystem management. The question of whether minke whales should be culled to reduce their fish consumption is a particularly controversial issue.","Whaling on this species has been intensive in the Northeast Atlantic, and reduced the population over the period 1952-83.  Catches were phased out by 1987, but whaling resumed, at a lower level, in 1993. Norway sets national catch limits based on the IWC’s Revised Management Procedure, a formula for setting safe catch limits (Hammond and Donovan in press). In presenting the RMP to the IWC for approval, the IWC SC offered three variants that it believed were acceptable and the IWC chose the most conservative option. Up until 2000, Norway used this option to set its national catch limits. It is now using the least conservative option presented by the SC. The national catch limit for 2006 was 1,052 whales, but only 521 were taken.<br/><br/>Coastal catches averaging about 200 per year were taken off Iceland until 1985 when the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling came into effect. Small (a total of 100 expected for the period 2003-2006) experimental catches resumed in 2003.  Catches off West Greenland continue, under an IWC catch limit of 175 whales annually, valid through 2007.  As discussed above the IWC Scientific Committee has expressed concern at its inability to provide scientific advice on an appropriate catch limit (IWC 2007).<br/><br/>Minke whales are subject to some level of incidental catch in fishing gear throughout much of their range, but in most areas the numbers involved are probably not significant.","<strong>North Atlantic</strong><br/>The IWC recognizes four stocks of minke whales in the North Atlantic: Northeast Atlantic, Central North Atlantic, West Greenland, and Canadian East Coast. The latter includes the US east coast.  Population estimates were last reviewed by the IWC SC in 2003 (IWC 2004), but a new estimate for West Greenland was accepted in 2006 (IWC 2007).  The best/most recent available estimates for the whole North Atlantic total about 182,000, and the Northeast Atlantic stock was estimated at c.80,000 individuals.<br/><br/>Minke whales have been exploited in the North Atlantic, mainly since the 1940s, and recorded catches total about 140,000 (IWC 2006).  The largest catches have been by Norwegian “small-type” whalers who have taken about 120,000 since 1948, mainly in the Northeast Atlantic.  Annual catches peaked at over 4,000 in the late 1950s, declining to about 2,000 annually in the early 1980s. Catches were phased out from 1984 to 1987. Commercial minke whaling resumed in 1993 at a lower level and continues to the present.  <br/><br/>About 4,000 minke whales were taken off Iceland during 1941-85, but recent abundance estimates imply that this would have had no discernible effect on the population.  About 8,000 common minke whales have been caught by small-type whaling off West Greenland, mainly since 1960. The present catch limits (up to 175 annually for the years 2003-7) were set by the IWC in the absence of advice from its Scientific Committee. Some concerns have been expressed by the IWC Scientific Committee over the sustainability of the catch levels given the uncertainty over the size of the population available to the hunters off West Greenland (IWC 2007) although sex ratio information suggests that the population may not have been significantly impacted by the catches (Witting 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Generation time</strong><br/>No satisfactory method of age determination has been developed for this species to date. Therefore the value of Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) was used. Unlike Antarctic minke whales, common minke whales tend not to develop ear plugs with readable layering (Lockyer 1984).  A method based on layer counts in tympanic bullae (Christensen 1981) could not be reproduced by later workers.  Other aging methods are being researched, but none is yet at the stage where it can be reliably applied to this species (Olsen and Øien 2002).",Unknown,"The common minke whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all oceans and in virtually all latitudes, from 65°S to 80°N.  In parts of its range it is very abundant, in other parts much less so.  Its migration patterns are poorly known.  It occurs in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere, but is not known in the northern Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>North Atlantic<br/>In summer, minke whales are common throughout the northern North Atlantic as far north as Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya, and as far south as 40°N (New Jersey) on the US east coast (Anon. 2005),  and as far south as the Hebrides (northwest British Isles) and the central North Sea in the east.  In mid-Atlantic the southern limit of summer abundance is at least as far south as 50°N (Sigurjónsson <em>et al.</em> 1991).  It is likely that at least a part of the minke whale population overwinters in the summer range, but there has been very little observation effort in winter to confirm this.<br/><br/>Minke whales also occur south of this range in the southeastern North Atlantic, but with no obvious seasonality, and are not common, with the exception of the Canary Islands, where they appear to be frequent year-round (van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1999).  There have been occasional sightings (Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 1983) and strandings (van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1999) off Spain and Portugal, Western Sahara, Mauritania and Senegal. Minke whales are rare in the Azores and not recorded from Madeira. The minke whale is considered a “visitor species” in the Mediterranean (average &lt;1 record per year) with one vagrant recorded in the Black Sea (Reeves and Notabartolo di Sciara 2006).  <br/><br/>There are very few winter records, but a summary by Mitchell (1991) indicates that they do occur in winter near Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Antilles, and the US coast south of 40°N. Ten strandings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson and Schiro 1997) but hardly any live sightings. A Norwegian winter expedition sent to the tropical Atlantic in 1989/90 to “find the breeding grounds of the minke whale” encountered just two minke whales, at 20°N and 10°N off West Africa in December (Folklow and Blix 1991).",,Marine,"Catch limits for all commercial whaling have been set at zero by the IWC since 1986. However, this moratorium does not apply to Iceland, Norway or the Russian Federation which have objected to this provision. IWC members are allowed to issue permits for whaling for scientific research. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling is permitted by the IWC for common minke whales off Greenland. Takes of dwarf minke whales have been excluded from the Japanese scientific whaling programme in the Antarctic (JARPA) since summer 1992/93 (Nishiwaki <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Minke whales, including <em>B. acutorostrata</em>, are listed on Appendix I of CITES, with the exception of the population from Greenland which is included in Appendix II. This implies prohibition of commercial international trade in its products, but that does not apply to Iceland, Norway or Japan, who hold reservations on the species. Common minke whales benefit from national protection measures implemented in several range countries.","",,false,false,Europe
9448238,2478,Balaenoptera physalus,Near Threatened,,2007,2007-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"European regional assessment: Near Threatened (approaching A1d). The population and range are large enough that Criteria B and D do not apply. Does not meet Criterion C (even at Near Threatened) because although the number of mature individuals is fairly low, there is no evidence of continuing decline. Generally in the North Atlantic populations are either stable or increasing, or there is no quantitative data. There are no estimates of historical or pre-exploitation abundance for the marine area covered by the European Mammal Assessment, but populations were undoubtedly depleted by commercial whaling. It is suspected that, by comparison with population levels 81 years (3 generations) ago, the population is currently 30-49% lower. This is a precautionary assessment that is not based on quantitative data, and it is strongly recommended that further surveys and modelling studies are carried out to better determine current and historic population size and trends.<br/><br/>The Mediterranean population of the fin whale was assessed in 2006 as Data Deficient (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).","Fin whales are often portrayed in the secondary literature as eating fish including juvenile herring (e.g. NAMMCO undated). However, the available quantitative evidence suggests that the fin whale's reputation as a fish-eater is largely overstated. In Icelandic catches, 96% contained krill only, 2.5% a mixture of krill and fish, and 1.6% fish only (Sigurjónsson and Víkingsson 1997), while only one of  267 fin whales caught in the northeast Pacific off British Columbia, Canada,  contained fish (Flinn <em>et al.</em> 2002), and over 99% of stomachs with food in the Antarctic contained krill (Kawamura 1994). On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) report apparent feeding of fin whales on American sand lance (sand eel) <em>Ammodytes americanus</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1975) found that capelin comprised 80-90% of prey in fin whales caught off Newfoundland.  Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and fin whales may feed opportunistically on capelin in high-capelin years. In summary, although the fin whale is more flexible in its diet than the blue whale (<em>B. musculus</em>), its consumption of fish is not necessarily a significant problem.","Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, fin whales were largely immune from human predation because they were too hard to catch.  Fin whales were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1975, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small aboriginal subsistence catches off West Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, with nine fin whales being taken that year.  A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of fin whales in the Antarctic in 2005, taking 10 whales each during 2005/06 and 2006/07, with plans to take 50 per year from the 2007/08 season (IWC 2006).  It seems unlikely that catching of fin whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/><br/>Fin whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale in vessel collisions (Laist<em> et al.</em> 2001). Five fatal collisions are recorded off the US east coast during 2000-04 (Cole <em>et al.</em> 2006).  Collisions with vessels appear to be a significant, but not necessarily unsustainable, source of mortality for the Mediterranean population (Weinrich <em>et al.</em> 2005, Reeves and Notabartolo di Sciara 2006).  <br/><br/>Fin whales are occasionally caught in fishing gear as bycatch: four deaths and serious injuries from this source are reported from the eastern US coast during 2000-04 (Cole <em>et al.</em> 2006); recent Japanese Progress Reports to the IWC (www.iwcoffice.org/sci_com/scprogress.htm) report about one fin whale by-caught per year on average.","<strong>North Atlantic</strong><br/>North Atlantic fin whales were comprehensively assessed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 1991 (IWC 1992), and an update for the northern part of the region was undertaken in 2006 in a joint workshop with NAMMCO (IWC 2007).  North Atlantic fin whale stocks had previously been assessed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 1976 (IWC 1977). Based mainly on past whaling operations, the IWC recognizes seven management areas in the North Atlantic: Nova Scotia; Newfoundland-Labrador; West Greenland; East Greenland-Iceland; North Norway; West Norway-Faeroe Islands; British Isles-Spain-Portugal.  Based on genetic evidence, it is now considered more likely that there are from two to four breeding stocks, which utilize these seven management areas in different proportions (IWC 2007).<br/><br/>The best available estimates of recent abundance accepted by the IWC Scientific Committee (IWC 2007) are: 25,800 (CV 0.125) in 2001 for the central North Atlantic (East Greenland-Iceland, Jan Mayen and the Faeroes);  4,100 (CV 0.21) in 1996-2001 for the northeastern North Atlantic (North and West Norway); and 17,355 (CV 0.27) in 1989 for the Spain-Portugal-British Isles area (Buckland <em>et al.</em> 1992). The only accepted estimate for West Greenland is 1,046 (CV 0.35) in 1988 (IWC 1992); a newer estimate from a 2005 survey could not be accepted due to methodological problems. There are no complete estimates for the western North Atlantic Northwest Atlantic, but partial estimates are 1,013 (95% CI 459-2,654) for Newfoundland in 2003-3 (IWC 2007), and 2,814 (CV 0.21) for the east coast of North America from the Gulf of St Lawrence southward (Anon. 2005).  <br/>  <br/>No significant trends were found in the total abundance for any of the above areas, but when the area west and southwest of Iceland was singled out, a significant increasing trend was found (IWC 2007).<br/><br/>Fin whales were heavily exploited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, starting in 1876, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes and British Isles.  Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Catch statistics for the early years are probably incomplete, and a large number of whales were killed but lost, due to lines breaking, etc., perhaps up to one-half in the first 20-25 years and one-third in the next 15-20 years (Tønnessen 1967).  The IWC Scientific Committee added 50% to recorded catches up to 1915 to allow for this (IWC 2007): recorded catches up to 1915 total 15,315 fin whales plus 29,024 unspecified whales of which about half may have been fin whales, thus the total kill may have been about 45,000 up to 1915.  The total recorded catch post-1915 has been about 55,000 fin whales.  The approximate figures by area are:  Canada 12,000; Norway 10,000; Iceland 10,000; Faeroes 5,000; Greenland 1,000; British Isles 3,000; Spain and Portugal 11,000; and pelagic operations 3,000. <br/><br/>The behaviour evident for the various North Atlantic fin whale populations following earlier reductions through whaling differs. It ranges from clear evidence of recovery to no firm indications of any increase. An estimated 14,000 fin whales were killed off North Norway during 1876-1904, and a further 1,500 during 1948-71, but fin whales are rare there now (although quite abundant off western Spitsbergen, where about 1,500 whales had been killed during 1904-11) (Øien 2003, 2004). An estimated 12,000 fin whales were killed off Iceland during 1890-1915, until whaling was suspended partly due to concerns about the reductions in the stocks, but the modern abundance data suggest that the there has been a recovery in the population that may still be continuing, particularly west of Iceland, despite catches during 1948-89 averaging about 220 per year (Branch and Butterworth 2006).  An estimated 10,000 fin whales were taken from the Faeroes, but about 25% of these were actually caught off eastern Iceland (IWC 2007).  Whaling from the Faeroes and West Norway petered out during the 1960s as whales became scarce (IWC 1977), but catches had apparently been mainly of migrating whales rather than local populations.  <br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>Catches of about 7,000 fin whales taken near the Straits of Gibraltar in the 1920s apparently depleted the local abundance, and fin whales are still rare there today, but this did not seem to affect the abundance of fin whales off northern Spain, where catches continued until 1985. The impact of catches on the fin whale stocks in the Northwest Atlantic is unclear (Mitchell 1972). The population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western Mediterranean at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al.</em> 1996).  It is likely, but not certain, that the historical catches near the Strait of Gibraltar were from the North Atlantic rather than from this population (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).  Palsbøll <em>et al.</em> (2004) found that Mediterranean fin whales probably have a small but non-zero genetic exchange with fin whales elsewhere in the North Atlantic.<br/><br/><strong>Generation time</strong> <br/>The default value of 27 years for generation time given in Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) was considered appropriate, given an absence of any indications to the contrary from available biological information for the species.",Unknown,"Fin whales occur worldwide, mainly but not exclusively further offshore. They are rare in the tropics, except in certain cooler-water areas such as off Peru.  <br/><br/><strong>North Atlantic</strong><br/>In the North Atlantic, the fin whale's range extends as far as Svalbard in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001). Their main summer range in the northwest Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (39°N) northward (Anon. 2005). In former times, fin whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar. While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it does not necessarily involve the entire population, and North Atlantic fin whales may occur to some extent throughout the year in all of their range, as suggested by acoustic data (Clark 1995).<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>There is a resident population in the central and western Mediterranean which is genetically distinct from that of the North Atlantic (Bérubé <em>et al.</em> 1998).  The species also occurs, but rarely, in the eastern Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).",,Marine,"The IWC set catch limits to zero for fin whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere in 1976. Catch limits for all commercial whaling have been set at zero by the IWC since 1986.

Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling is permitted by the IWC for fin whales taken off West Greenland.

10414811,41291,Oryctolagus cuniculus,Near Threatened,,2007,2006-05-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"European and EU 25: Populations in all parts of Europe where the rabbit has been established since before 1500 A.D. are considered for this assessment. Significant declines have been reported in many parts of the rabbit's European range, and it is inferred that declines approach 30% over the last 10 years overall. Consequently the species is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A2b). In many countries outside Europe, the rabbit is an alien invasive species that is itself a threat to many other species; the listing of Near Threatened in Europe should not in any way deter efforts to eradicate the rabbit in areas where it is a conservation problem.","The rabbit occupies a variety of habitats, including grassland, meadows, pastures, arable field-margins, sand-dunes, grassy cliffs, heathland and open woodland. In summer, it feeds on the vegetative parts of a variety of grasses and herbaceous plants, and in winter it eats grasses, bulbs and bark (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). It can be an agricultural pest in areas where it is abundant, and it has caused severe damage to native ecosystems in some areas where it has been introduced (for example Australia) (Ward 2005). Rabbits are an essential keystone element of the Mediterranean ecosystem in Spain and Portugal, being preyed on by at least 39 predator species including the Critically Endangered Iberian lynx <em>Lynx pardinus</em> and the vulnerable and range-restricted Iberian imperial eagle <em>Aquila adalberti</em> (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006). Rabbit declines are considered to have had a negative impact on both of these threatened species (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006).","Myxomatosis caused severe population declines in the 1950s, but numbers subsequently rallied as the myxoma virus become less virulent and the rabbit more immune (Macdonald and Barrett 1993, Macdonald and Tattersall 2001). Myxomatosis was deliberately introduced to Europe in 1952 in an effort to control rabbit numbers; it originates from South America (Ward 2005). Declines in recent years have been attributed to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; also known as DHV), myxomatosis, and over-hunting (Ward 2005, Spitzenberger 2005). RHD is believed to have originated in Europe, where it was first detected in 1987 (Ward 2005). Habitat loss (due to agriculture, forestry, development, forest fires and land abandonment) is considered to be a contributory factor to rabbit decline in Iberia (Ward 2005). It is a popular game species, and over-hunting may be a problem in some parts of its range. Pest control measures may cause local population declines. There have been attempts in Australia to develop a genetically modified immunocontraceptive virus for rabbits, and accidental or deliberate illegal spread of such a virus could be a threat to rabbits in the future (Henzell and Cooke 2003, Trout 2003, Ward 2005).","It is a common species throughout much of its European range. Population densities of 0.5 to 10 individuals per hectare are typical, with densities of up to 100 individuals per hectare having been recorded (Homolka and Zima 1999). However, in at least some parts of Europe the species has undergone significant decline in recent years. In Portugal, a population reduction of 24% was recorded between 1995 and 2002 (Alves and Ferreira 2002), and in Spain and Portugal as a whole it is estimated that there are now as few as 5% of the number of rabbits that existed 50 years ago (Ward 2005). Large declines since 1990 have also been noted in Austria (Spitzenberger 2005) and Germany (Eylert 2004), and in the UK the species declined significantly between 1995 and 2002 (different survey methods give a 48% decline from 1995-2002 and a 23% decline from 1997-2002: Battersby 2005). Subspecies <em>O. c. huxleyi</em>, which occurs on certain Atlantic and Mediterranean islands, has a restricted range and may be threatened (Homolka and Zima 1999).",Decreasing,"<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> is a widespread and abundant species, which has been introduced to all continents except Antartica. It was originally restricted to Spain, Portugal, western France, and northern Africa, but it has spread over the last two millenia to almost all parts of the European region, including the British Isles, many Mediterranean islands, the Azores, and Madeira. This range expansion occurred partly because of deliberate introductions, as the rabbit was widely exploited as a food source, and partly through natural spread. It remains absent from most of Fennoscandia, and occurs only sporadically on the Balkan peninsula. Outside Europe, it was introduced to Australia, in 1788 and again in 1859, where it is now widespread (Thompson and King 1994). It was introduced to South America unsuccessfully several times since the mid-nineteenth century, and successfully in about 1936; it now maintains a limited range in Argentina and Chile (Thompson and King 1994). Found in many islands in the Pacific, off the African coast, New Zealand, and the Caribbean (Thompson and King 1994).",,Terrestrial,"The issue of eradication of <em>O. cuniculus</em> from its introduced range (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and many islands) may have overshadowed the significance of rabbit decline in its native range. However, the importance of <em>O. cuniculus</em> within its natural range necessitates that it be considered for listing as threatened in spite of its global abundance. It is a keystone component of the Iberian ecosystem, as prey for specialist predators (Virgos <em>et al.</em> 2005) and as a landscape modeller (Delibes <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ward 2005). It is an important game species in Spain and Portugal (Ward 2005). <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> occurs in some protected areas within its natural range, including Donana National Park in Spain (Ward 2005) and Serra da Malcata Nature reserve in Portugal (700km<sup>2</sup>) where the Iberian lynx is protected.<br/><br/>Ward (2005) summarises key issues regarding the conservation of the European rabbit within its native range: <br/>""- Establish rabbit monitoring programs to accurately describe decline directly.<br/>- Create and implement a management plan for rabbit recovery that prioritizes critical ranges and populations. Some plans have begun for local regions, including Donana National park.  <br/>- Programs to limit the incidence and impact of new and existing diseases may be difficult in the wild, though some success has been observed in captive populations. Current vaccines do not confer total immunity to RHD or myxomatosis, have side effects such as increasing vulnerability to predators, and have short-lived effectiveness. A genetically modified live myxomatosis virus vaccine, LapinVac, is controversial because of the possibility of unpredictable evolution of the virus, and its potential spread to rabbit populations outside the natural <em>O. cuniculus</em> range where eradication, not conservation, is the objective. Increasing habitat quality may indirectly help rabbit disease resistance. Controlling disease vectors for myxomatosis has not been found to be effective. Preventing the spread of modified immunocontraceptive viruses engineered in Australia to control rabbit fertility may become an issue.<br/>- Reducing hunting impact is not guaranteed to reduce decline because disease effects often outweigh hunting as a threat, and because implementation of restrictions would likely not be realistic given the prevalence of hunting in Iberia. Revisions to existing hunting seasons have been proposed and some tested, but even moving the season to summer when rabbits are most abundant has caused concern in trials because the overall catch increases and the season coincides with a peak in death from disease. A growing recognition among hunters of the issue of rabbit decline has led to some self-restraint, and though often well intentioned, uninformed management strategies are leading to inappropriate actions. Rather than focusing on hunting restraint, many hunters exert efforts to reduce rabbit predators, which are not directly responsible for decline. As a very large demographic, hunters could represent a powerful force in maintaining sustainable hunting populations, if the awareness of the issue of decline increased within this group.<br/>- Rabbit populations affected by agriculture represent a sensitive issue, as rabbits are typically seen as a pest and an economic liability for farmers. Despite pressures from environmental groups, many farmers continue to take measures to eradicate rabbits from their land, even in areas where rabbit populations have declined dramatically. Awareness among farmers of rabbit conservation issues is low. Government policy allows farmers to control rabbits with permits, and though crop loss due to rabbit damage is economically subsidized, no requirement of those compensated is made for conservation.<br/>- Halting and reversing habitat loss and fragmentation was aided in the 1990s by the establishment of many national parks in Spain, but much optimal rabbit habitat is on private land. A shift from high-intensity farming and monoculture forestry back to mixed agro-forestry and small scale farming would help sustain rabbit populations. Natura 2000 promotion of sustainable development and EU subsidies supporting environmentally friendly agriculture are promising but underfunded and too new to demonstrate a significant impact. Eucalyptus plantation removal has demonstrated a positive effect on rabbit populations, but may compromise other environmental issues such as erosion and conditioned bird habitat, as well as economic impact.<br/>- Reintroductions have been a key focus of conservation efforts, with up to 500,000 released annually in Spain and France. The efforts so far have not increased rabbit populations, due to increased mortality from predation and inadvertent spread of disease, which may actually have a net negative impact. The flaws in reintroduction practices do not completely negate the importance of the efforts, which have been shown to help sustain predators and hunting populations. The success of introductions may be increased by fencing from predators and competitors and preventing dispersal.<br/>- Though rabbit predators have not directly caused rabbit decline, factors that have caused initial decline (e.g., disease, habitat loss) are exacerbated by some opportunistic predators (while not caused by specialist predators like the Iberian lynx and Imperial eagle). Game keeping efforts to increase rabbit populations often focus on predator reduction, sometimes counterproductively, causing decline of top predators that are already threatened. Efforts could be more productively focused on habitat protection, reduction of rabbit mortality by humans (hunting, poisoning), and reducing disease impacts.""",Afrotropical|Australasian|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

Other prey include ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares.  Cheetahs, unlike other African predators, rarely scavenge and do not remain long with their kills, many of which are stolen by other carnivores.  Cheetahs are primarily active during the day, unlike other predators, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are primarily found in open grassy habitats, but also make use of dry forest, savanna woodland, semi-desert and scrub, being absent from tropical rainforest.  There are reports of cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In the central Sahara, cheetahs occur in high mountain habitat - the Saharan mountains are hyper-arid, but still receive slightly higher rainfall than the surrounding desert.  They are thus better vegetated and support small permanent waterholes and antelope populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Cheetah habitat in Iran consists of desert, much of it with precipitation of fewer than 100 mm per year. The terrain ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m. The vegetation, if any, consists of a sparse cover of shrubs, most less than one meter tall, of the genera <em>Salsola</em>, <em>Artemisia</em>, <em>Zygophyllum</em>, <em>Astragulus</em>, <em>Aphaxis</em>, and others. Gazelles <em>Gazella subgutturosa</em> and <em>G. bennetti</em> were preferred prey, but they have now become scarce through over-hunting and replacement by livestock (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Opportunistic recovery of cheetah kills suggests that wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian ibex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are the key prey species today though none are considered optimal for cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among the felids.  Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three.  Some coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group.  Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, which remain attached to and mate with the females in a single pride, cheetah male coalitions mate with as many females as possible (Caro 1994), and females show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Female cheetahs in areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains) follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km²) and attempt to mate with females passing through (Durant <em>et al</em>. 1988; Caro 1994).  However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females have smaller, overlapping ranges that are similar in size (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  On Namibian farmlands, where prey is non-migratory, both cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km²); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range.  The reasons for such large home ranges were unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002).   <br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for lions, leopards, tigers and jaguars in prime habitat: Durant, 2007).  On the Serengeti plains, cheetah densities range from 0.8-1.0 per 100 km², but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km² (Caro 1994).  Caro (1994) attributes lower cheetah densities to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as lions and hyenas that can kill cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands, where lions and hyenas have been eradicated, cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km²) (Marker 2002).","In Eastern Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation was identified as the primary threat during a conservation strategy workshop (Anon. 2007).   Because cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of cheetahs (Durant 2007).<br/><br/>A depleted wild ungulate prey base is of serious concern in northern Africa (Berzins and Belbachir 2006).  Cheetahs which turn to livestock are killed as pests (Claro 2003; Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 2003; Wacher <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Conflict with farmers and depletion of the wild prey base are also considered significant threats in parts of Eastern Africa (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah <em>A. j. venaticus</em> is threatened indirectly by loss of prey base through human hunting activities. In addition, most protected areas are open to seasonal livestock grazing, which potentially places huge pressure on the resident ungulate populations through disturbance and potential competition (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, domestic dogs accompanying the herds present a likely threat to both cheetahs and their prey (H. Ziaie pers. comm. 2008)  An emerging threat is the possibility of fragmentation into discontinuous subpopulations as a result of increasing developmental pressures (mining, oil, roads, railways); this is particularly the case in Kavir N.P., currently the north-western limit of the Asiatic Cheetah's range (L. Hunter and L. Marker pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Conflict with farmers and ranchers is the major threat to cheetahs in southern Africa (Purchase <em>et al</em>. 2007).  Cheetah are often killed or persecuted because they are a perceived threat to livestock, despite the fact that they cause relatively little damage. In Namibia, very large numbers of cheetahs have been live-trapped and removed by ranchers seeking to protect their livestock (from government permit records, Nowell [1996] calculated that over 9,500 cheetahs were removed from 1978-1995).  While removal rates have fallen, in part due to intensified conservation and education efforts, many ranchers still view cheetahs as a problem animal, despite research showing that cheetahs were only responsible for 3% of livestock losses to predators (Marke, 2002). Although cheetah in Iran have been killed because of predation on livestock, since 2003, there has been no direct evidence of killing cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007), though it is likely most incidents go unreported. <br/><br/>Cheetahs are also vulnerable to being caught in snares set for other species (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>Another threat to the cheetah is interspecific competition with other large predators, especially lions. On the open, short-grass plains of the Serengeti, juvenile mortality can be as high as 95%, largely due to predation by lions (Laurenson 1994). However, mortality rates are lower in more closed habitats (Caro in press). <br/><br/>CITES allows legal trade in live animals and hunting trophies under an Appendix I quota system (annual quotas: Namibia - 150; Zimbabwe - 50; Botswana - 5).  This was accepted by CITES as a way to enhance the economic value of cheetahs on private lands and provide an economic incentive for their conservation (Nowell 1996).  The global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining; cheetahs breed poorly in captivity and in 2001 30% of the captive population was wild-caught (Marker 2002).  While analysis of trade records in the CITES database shows that these countries have reported almost no live exports since the late 1990s, Purchase <em>et al.</em> (2007) are concerned that there is a substantial illegal cross-border trade in live animals.  There is also concern about illegal trade in skins, as well as capture of live cubs for trade to the Middle East (Anon. 2007).  There is an increasing trade in cubs from north-east Africa into the Middle East (Amir 2005),  but there is currently little trade in cubs from the Sahel region, where it was previously considered a major problem (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are active during the daytime and there is concern that they can be driven off their kills by tourist cars crowding around, or mothers separated from their cubs.  Burney (1980) conducted a study and concluded that tourist cars did not seem to harm cheetahs, and in fact sometimes helped, as cheetah chases more often ended in a kill when there were cars around, distracting prey, providing cover from which to stalk, or otherwise waking cheetahs up to notice prey in the area.  However, tourist numbers have risen sharply by then, and its potential impact on cheetahs remains a concern (Caro 1994; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>The Eastern African cheetah conservation strategy (Anon. 2007) identified four sets of constraints to mitigating these threats across a large spatial scale.  Political constraints include lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability in some ecologically important areas, and lack of political will to foster cheetah conservation.  Economic constraints include lack of financial resources to support conservation, and lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife.  Social constraints include negative conceptions of cheetahs, lack of capacity to achieve  conservation, lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes leading to subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation.  These potentially mutable human constraints contrast with several biological constraints which are characteristic of cheetahs and cannot be changed, including wide-ranging behaviour, negative interactions with other large carnivores, and potential susceptibility to disease.<br/><br/>Disease is a potential threat to the cheetah (Anon. 2007), as its reduced genetic diversity can increase a population's susceptibility  (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1983).  However, the most serious disease mortality thus far documented in wild cheetahs was from naturally occurring anthrax in Namibia's Etosha National Park; cheetahs, unlike other predators, do not scavenge carcasses of ungulates killed by anthrax, and thus had no built-up immunity when they preyed upon springbok sick with the disease (Lindeque <em>et al</em>. 1998).  The cheetah's low density may offer some measure of protection against infectious disease; for example, cheetahs were not affected by an outbreak of Canine Distemper Virus in the Serengeti National Park which killed over 1/3 of the lion population.  Serological surveys of cheetahs on Namibian farmland indicate some exposure and survival of the disease (Marker 2002).","Southern Africa is the cheetah's regional stronghold, with a ""roughly"" estimated population of at least 4,500 adults (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).  This regional estimate breaks down as follows:  Angola - present but unknown; Botswana - 1,800; Malawi - &lt;25 (and probably extirpated: Purchase and Purchase 2007); Mozambique: &lt;50; Namibia - 2,000; South Africa - 550; Zambia - 100; Zimbabwe - 400.  A large proportion of the estimated population lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game, and where lions and hyenas have been extirpated.<br/><br/>The number of known resident cheetahs in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents.  Most population estimates were derived from applying a density estimate of one adult per 100 km² to mapped resident range areas during a conservation strategy workshop, although a few are based on research.  Only four of the 15 known populations were estimated to number &gt;200 animals; the largest population (Serengeti/Maro/Tsavo in Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 710.  It would be much smaller if unprotected lands were included.  Overall, less than half of the estimated cheetah population inhabits protected areas.  In addition, approximately half lives in habitat blocks which are trans-boundary, requiring international cooperation for conservation of the population.  Cheetahs possibly occur over an area which is several times as large as the range of the known population (Anon. 2007).  <br/><br/>These estimates can be compared with previous population estimates based on extensive field interviews and application of density estimates.  There is rough accord for Kenya at 793 (Gros 1998) and Tanzania at 569-1,007 (Gros 2002).  However, in Uganda, Gros and Rejmanek (1999) estimated 40-295 with a wider range in the Karamoja region, whereas now cheetahs have been extirpated and just 12 are estimated to persist in Kidepo National Park and surroundings (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In the remainder of Africa, there are few reliable population estimates.  Cheetahs are considered extinct or possibly extinct in many countries (Marker 2002).  In northwest Africa the population is probably fewer than 250 mature individuals and the subspecies A. j. heckii is listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>In Asia cheetahs are now known to exist only in Iran, where the subspecies A. j. venaticus is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007) and listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>The known cheetah population is not much greater than 7,000, and the total population is unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, thus meeting the criteria for Vulnerable.  The current known population is half the 15,000 estimated by Myers (1975) from his continental status assessment.  The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) could be less than half of the total population (Kelly 2001). <br/><br/>While the current rate of population decline is of most concern, and the historical rate of decline has been severe (Nowell and Jackson, 1996; Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005), attention has also focused on the cheetah's having perhaps suffered even more extreme losses in the distant past.  The cheetah species exhibits remarkably low levels of genetic diversity in comparison to other felids (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1986) (but not compared to carnivores in general: Merola 1994).  This is consistent with inbreeding among a very few individuals surviving one or more catastrophic population bottlenecks in the past, with the first possibly occurring during the late Pleistocene extinctions, around 10,000 years ago, according to analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien 1995).  <br/><br/>It is unclear what sort of agent could have caused such an extreme population decline in a wide-ranging species, and alternative explanations have been explored.  Hedrick (1996) suggested the low levels of genetic variation could result from a very low effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population that is actually passing on its genes), and Kelly's (2001) calculations of effective population size in cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains were quite low (44% or less of the actual population).  She found that only a few females contributed disproportionately to future generations by raising offspring which survived and reproduced (Kelly 2001).  Genetic analysis by Gottelli <em>et al.</em> (2007) showed that male cheetahs, on the other hand, passed on their genes more successfully than expected.  Female cheetahs mated with multiple males, many non-resident, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity.  This indicates that rates of genetic loss should be lower than anticipated by Kelly (2001), and underscores the importance of cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.   <br/><br/>While the causes of the cheetah's low levels of genetic variation are unclear, what is clear is that large populations are necessary to conserve it.  Since cheetahs are a low density species, conservation areas need to be quite large, larger than most protected areas.",Stable,"Cheetahs have disappeared from huge areas of their historic range.  They still occur widely, but sparsely, in Africa, but Ray <em>et al.</em> (2005) estimate that the cheetahs have disappeared from 76% of their historic range on the continent.<br/><br/>In Asia, the cheetah has lost almost all its vast historic range, which within the last century extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Habibi 2004; Mallon 2007).  Part of the reason for their disappearance in Asia is live captures of cheetahs, which were trained to hunt for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh, 1995).  The main cause, however, was likely depletion of the wild prey base, especially gazelles, as well as direct killing of cheetahs and development of their habitat (Mallon, 2007).  The Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered.  Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001).  While Habibi (2004) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, a cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, although there has been significant range loss in parts of these regions.  Cheetahs are known to occur only in 6% of their historical range in Eastern Africa (310,586 km²), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (Anon. 2007).  Current distribution in several countries remains largely unknown (Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Angola, Mozambique and Zambia).  Cheetahs are known to be extirpated from large areas in Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi (Anon. 2007, 2008).  In some parts of southern Africa they occur extensively outside protected areas on commercial ranch land where other large predators (lions and hyenas) have been extirpated (Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe) (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined most drastically in northern and western Africa (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).  The subspecies (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information on northwest Africa.  <br/><br/>Cheetah persistence in the eastern Sahara is unlikely.<br/><br/>Cheetahs are possibly extinct in Libya. Specimens were previously collected near the Egyptian border (northeastern part of the country), in Dahra, Sirtica (north-central), Bir Ghazal and Hamada-el-Homra (northwestern). Other records include Fezzan, Khor-el-Gifa, Gikherra (eastern), El Ftaia (near coastal area) and Mizda (Hufnagl 1972). Myers (1975) mentioned that cheetahs were noted in Niger/Libyan borders as well as Niger/Algerian borders. An inquiry with local Tuaregs suggested that the species might not longer be present in Akoukas Mountains (J.-L. Bernezat pers. comm. 2007).  <br/><br/>In Tunisia, cheetahs were formerly reported to roam in sandy expanses south of Chott-el-Djerid, the desert areas south of Foum Tatahouine and the Grand Erg Occidental and its surroundings (Schomber and Kock 1960). There are no recent records on the species in the country which make it presumably extinct. The El-Borma region, near the Algerian boundaries, was probably among the areas where cheetahs have last been seen in 1974 and documented (Louis 1979).  <br/><br/>As far as Egypt is concerned, data collated during the last few decades suggest that cheetahs are extremely rare, if not extinct, in the country. Osborn and Helmy (1980) provided original and literature-based records from the Matrouh Governorate and Sinai. According to Saleh <em>et al</em>. (2001), cheetahs became extinct from most of the Mediterranean coastal region and easily accessible inland habitats of El-Maghra and Siwa oases one decade after being widely distributed in the northern Egyptian Western Desert until the 1970s. The main reasons explaining cheetah extirpation have been attributed to extensive and uncontrolled hunting and the development of coastal lands (Saleh <em>et al</em>. 2001). If not completely vanished, the species is believed to be confined, with a very low density, to the Western Desert and around the Qattara Depression (Saleh <em>et al</em>., 2001; Hoath, 2003). Recent records from North Sinai, including one female and three cubs killed by Bedouin hunters in 1993, as well as one female seen with two cubs in November 1994, have not been verified (Hoath 2003). <br/><br/>In the eastern Sahel and central Africa, there is little current information:<br/><br/>Current cheetah distribution in most of its historic range in Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia are unknown (Anon. 1997).  In Chad, although cheetahs were still present and seen occasionally in Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim in the 1970s (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008). A recent wildlife survey in western and central Chad, including Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve, conducted by the Sahelo-Saharan Interest Group in 2001, failed to detect any cheetah presence in the region (Monfort <em>et al</em>. 2003). In the Central Saharan (northern) part of the country, cheetahs still occur, in very low density, in and around the Ennedi Massif (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008 based on Rava's pers. comm.). There is no information on previously reported populations in the Tibesti Mountains (Central Sahara). In southeastern Chad, cheetahs may still survive to date in Zakouma National Park (population still present in the protected area as of 2006 [N. Vanherle pers. comm. 2008]). <br/><br/>In central Africa, current cheetah distribution in the savanna regions of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo is unknown (Marker 2002).  It is considered extinct in Rwanda and Burundi, and possibly extinct in Nigeria.  Rosevear (1974) underlined the paucity of positive records for Nigeria and mentioned Lake Chad, Yan Tumaki (Katsina Division) and possibly Bauchi Plateau as localities for three specimens kept in the British Museum. Happold (1987) raised the possibility of their occurrence near Cameroonian boundaries, and also in the Yankari Game Reserve (Happold 1987). Recent reports from protected area managers and wildlife traders indicate that a threatened small cheetah population may still range in restricted areas in north-centre and northeastern parts of the country (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2008).","Cheetahs are hunted for sport and trophies, as well as handicrafts products. Live animals are also traded - the global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining. Pest animals are also removed.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson, 1996. However, a number of countries permit cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock (Purchase <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  In Namibia, for example, one is permitted to retain the skin as long as the killing is reported  (Nowell, 1996).  Such policies may at least permit cheetah killing to be monitored.<br/><br/>Promotion of livestock management regimes which minimize conflict with cheetahs are an important conservation measure, pioneered by the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia (Marker <em>et al.</em>, 2003) but now being applied more widely.  Elements of successful conservation management include availability of wild prey and more intensive livestock herd protection, especially using guard dogs.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Cheetah is protected in Iran. The main protected areas for this species include Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park and Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh P.A., and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge. A radio-telemetry study in Iran is providing the first detailed data on cheetahs in Iran (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Several countries, including Namibia and Kenya, have developed national action plans or conservation strategies for cheetahs (Nowell, 1996; Durant, 2007); regional conservation strategies have been developed for Southern (Dickman <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Anon., 2008) and Eastern Africa (Anon., 2007); and there is also a global strategy (Bartels <em>et al.</em>, 2002).  These plans call for a number of improvements in monitoring, surveys and information exchange (to better understand cheetah distribution and status); promotion of human-cheetah coexistence (to reduce conflict and develop incentives to conserve cheetahs); national land use planning (to ensure viable national cheetah populations); capacity building (to improve management); policy and legislation (to ensure legal consistency and remove loopholes) and advocacy (to raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation needs).<br/><br/>Several specialist networks of cheetah conservationists have been established, including the Global Cheetah Forum (affiliated with the IUCN Conservation Breeding Specialist Group) and the North African Regional Cheetah Action Group (NARCAG/OGRAN).  The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (www.catsg.org)<br/><br/>Important protected areas that represent strongholds for Cheetah populations in Africa include the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa, Botswana), Nxai Pan and Chobe National Parks, and Okavango Delta (Botswana), Etosha N.P. (Namibia), Liuwa Plains N.P. (Zambia), and, of course, the Serengeti N.P. (Tanzania, Kenya) (Caro in press). In West Africa, the major remaining stronghold for the species is the WAPO protected areas complex. There is a surviving population of Cheetah in the Ahaggar National Park in Algeria (Wacher <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>However, most cheetah occur outside of protected areas (where they are often persecuted as pests), and given their need for large areas they require conservation action on a landscape scale (for example, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, zoning for land-use to maintain habitat connectivity, and wild prey restoration) (Marker, 2002; Anon., 2007).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

Previously—under a slightly different taxonomic concept, which included <span><em>baumstarki</em> as a subspecies—<em>Erythrocebus patas</em> was assessed as Least Concern (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Although <em>Erythrocebus patas</em> has a wide geographic range and is sometimes locally common, there is an observed population reduction throughout its range, particularly in eastern Africa. <em>Erythrocebus patas</em> does not meet the criteria for Vulnerable; however, the criteria for A2cd are nearly met as the population has likely declined by more than 20% over the last 30 years (three generations). Abundance, extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are expected to continue to decline as the causes of these declines (mainly due to habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation, but also hunting) are ongoing and unlikely to be reversed.</p>","<p><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is a medium-sized, diurnal, largely terrestrial, monkey. Occupies vegetation types ranging from grassland, to wooded savanna, to woodland (Isbell 2013). Most common in thinly bushed <em>Acacia</em> woodland. Appears to have a preference for woodland-grassland margins. Generally avoids dense vegetation, including riverine forest (Hall 1965, Isbell 2013). In East Africa, <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> is strongly associated with Whistling Thorn Acacia <em>Acacia drepanolobium</em> open woodland (Isbell 1998). At Ennedi Massif, northeastern Chad, and Äir Massif, central northern Niger, <em>E. patas</em> occurs in subdesertic grass, sparse <em>Acacia</em> woodland, and bushland (Dekeyser 1950, S. Turner pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Although <em>E. patas</em> can climb trees when alarmed, it usually relies on its speed on the ground to escape.<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. pyrrhonotus </em>is omnivorous, feeding on gums, arthropods, berries, flowers, fruits, and seeds (Chism and Rowell 1988, De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2008, Isbell 2013). Visits to water are typically daily during the dry season. Often use man-made water sources (e.g., dams, tanks, troughts). Use fences to sit on and scan from. In all areas were encountered in Kenya, <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> are somewhat habituated to humans, mainly to pastoralists, farmers and 'monkey chasers' in crop fields. In Busia District, central western Kenya, they have adapted to a high human population and little natural vegetation. Here, they eat maize and other crops (De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2008, Butynski and De Jong 2014b). In Kidepo Valley National Park, northeastern Uganda, <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus </em>raid garbage bins on a daily basis (Butynski and De Jong 2014a).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. pyrrhonotus</em> lives in single-male groups of 13-56 individuals (Chism and Rowell 1988). Burnham (2004) reported longer day ranges for all-male groups (mean 7.3 km/day) compared with social groups (mean 4.7 km/day) in the same area of Laikipia County, central Kenya. Here, home range sizes of social groups are 23-40 km², depending on group size (Chism and Rowell 1988, Enstam and Isbell 2004), but elsewhere can be as large as 52 km² (e.g., group of 31 individuals in Murchison Falls National Park, northwestern Uganda; Hall 1965).</p>","<p>                   </p><p>Main threats to <em>Erythrocebus patas</em> throughout the geographic distribution, but probably particularly in East Africa, are habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due primarily to agricultural expansion and intensification (both crops and livestock), charcoal production and ’development’ activities (e.g., settlements, roads, powerlines, dams, wind farms).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is primarily distributed throughout the Sahelian Region and Sudanian Region. The Sahel is a region with major land degradation related to its rapidly growing human population (UNEP 2012). The Sahelian Region holds about 8 people/km², while the Sudanian Region has about 31 people/km² (Eva <em>et al</em>. 2006). Between now and 2050, almost 24% of the global human population increase will occur in 10 of the 11 countries of the Sahelian Region (UNDP 2017). The rapid growing human population has converted large parts of the originally wooded savanna to agriculture, grassland and bushland (UNEP 2012). The woodlands of the Sudanian Region are under similar pressure. During 1990-2000 alone, a massive 25,000 km²/yr of dry forest and woodlands were lost in the Sudanian Region (FAO 2005). This rapid and extensive loss of <em>E. patas</em> habitat over the Sahelian Region and Sudanian Region is expected to continue over the long term.<br/><br/>In Africa, the ‘Rate of Natural Increase’ of the human population is 2.5%, compared to 1.1% worldwide (PRB 2019). Over all of the range states for <em>E. patas</em>, the human population is doubling every 20-30 years. As such, there is ever increasing competition between people and <em>E. patas</em> for habitat and water (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009; Isbell 2013, Butynski and De Jong 2014b). In none of the range states are natural resources, such as water, soil, bushlands or woodlands, being used sustainably. Perennial water sources have been lost and competition with people and livestock over access to water is severe (De Jong and Butynski 2017). Among the results are widespread degradation, loss and fragmentation of <em>E. patas</em> habitat, and a rapid decline in the abundance and geographic distribution of this species. <br/><br/>The species is in rapid decline in Laikipia County, central Kenya (De Jong and Butynski 2017).<em> E. p. pyrrhonotus </em>is the most threatened primate, despite the fact that this monkey is relatively compatible with livestock ranching, the primary economic activity in Laikipia (Butynski and De Jong 2014b). Habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation are predominantly caused by over-grazing and over-browsing by livestock, conversion of large areas to cropland, uncontrolled cutting of trees, charcoal production, and colonization of invasive plants, particularly Prickly Pears <em>Opuntia</em> spp. Damage is most severe in and around rural and communal areas – where the human population is most dense and where the extraction of natural resources is most intense and unsustainable (De Jong and Butynski 2017). High densities of Savanna Elephant <em>Loxodonta</em> <em>africana</em> over large parts of Laikipia County, and concentrations of Black Rhinoceros <em>Diceros</em> <em>bicornis</em> and Reticulated Giraffe <em>Giraffa reticulata</em> in some areas, have greatly reduced the abundance of Whistling Thorn Acacia, a key food species for Patas in Laikipia County (Isbell 1998, De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, De Jong and Butynski 2017).<br/><br/>In West Africa, much <em>E. p. patas</em> habitat has been degraded and lost due to fire, desertification, and livestock grazing and browsing (Oates 2011).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. patas</em> is hunted for food in Central Africa and West Africa (Kurpiers <em>et al</em>. 2016), and is widely persecuted as a crop pest (De Jong 2004, De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. villiersi</em> reported to raid crops (Dekeyser 1950) and is, most likely, persecuted in response.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is a widespread species which typically occurs at low densities. Probably more abundant in the western parts of the range (although there are no recent surveys to confirm this) than in the east (Isbell 2013). Typical density might be 1.5 animals/km². Hall (1965) recorded 110 Patas in a 3,112 km² area in northern Uganda. In Kidepo Valley National Park, northeastern Uganda, the rate of encounter with <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> from a slow-moving vehicle was 0.05 groups/hr. (0.002 groups/km; Butynski and De Jong 2017).<br/><br/>In Kenya, the geographic distribution of <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> declined about 56% from <em>ca</em> 93,120 km² prior to 1995 to <em>ca</em> 52,520 km² in 2014, and the size of gaps among populations increased (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, Butynski and De Jong 2014a).<br/><br/>During 1979–1981, Laikipia Country supported a minimum of 415 <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> (14–15 groups; Isbell and Chism 2007). The number in 2000 was 310–445 individuals (13–17 groups; Isbell and Chism 2007). In 2017, there were about 145-155 individuals (13 groups) in eastern Laikipia (De Jong and Butynski 2017). Although the 2017 survey did not include western Laikipia, the survey area was more than twice the size of that of the two previous surveys. Mean group size of <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> in eastern Laikipia in 2017 was 12 individuals. Patas numbers have declined in eastern Laikipia mainly through reduction in group size rather than through a reduction in the number of groups (De Jong and Butynski 2017). Although surveys in western Laikipia are required, the preliminary data suggest that there are far fewer Patas in western Laikipia than in eastern Laikipia (Y. de Jong and T. Butynski pers. obs). It is likely that Laikipia County supported &lt;225 Patas in 2017.<br/><br/>This subspecies<em> </em>appears to no longer be present at Alupe, Busia District, western Kenya. There is a population of unknown size and geographic distribution in the Karasuk Hills region of central western Kenya (De Jong and Butynski 2013, 2014, Butynski and De Jong 2014a).<br/><br/>In 2016, in an area of <em>ca</em> 200 km² on the Ennedi Massif, northeastern Chad, S. Turner (pers. comm. 2016) encountered five or six groups of <em>E. patas</em> (total 80-100 individuals) during a brief visit.<br/><br/>In Bafing Faunal Reserve, southern Mali, <em>E. p. patas</em> occurred at 1.7 individuals/km² in 1993 (Pavy 1993 in Oates 2011).<br/><br/>In Comoé National Park, northern Côte d’Ivoire, <em>ca</em> 1,150 <em>E. p. patas</em> occupied <em>ca</em> 11,500 km² in 1991 (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2000 in Oates 2011). <br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. patas</em> is common in the Gadabedji Biosphere Reserve, central Niger (T. Rabeil pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Magin (1990) estimated a population of 500 <em>E. p. villiersi </em>in the central massifs and plateau of the Aïr Massif, central northern Niger (IUCN 2017).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. villiersi </em>is common on Aïr Massif (T. Rabeil, T. Wacher and J. Darbey pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Between now and 2050, almost 24% of the global demographic increase will  occur in 10 of the 11 countries of the Sahelian Region (UNDP 2017). Across the species' global range, the rapidly growing human population has converted large parts of the originally wooded savanna to agriculture, grassland, and bushland (UNEP 2012). The woodlands of the Sudanian Region are under similar pressure. During 1990 to 2000 alone, a massive 25,000 km²/yr of dry forest and woodlands were lost in the Sudanian Region (FAO 2005). Based on these levels of habitat loss, the global population of <em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is suspected to have declined by at least 20% over the last 30 years (three generations).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is endemic to tropical Africa.

All Patas groups in Laikipia occur outside legally protected areas. Probably all live on private livestock ranches where there are large areas of Whistling Thorn Acacia woodland and artificial sources of water (Isbell and Chism 2007, De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, Butynski and De Jong 2014b).

Major threats to Geladas include the conversion of their habitat into farmland, grazing land and human settlements, as well as the climate change impacts (Dunbar 1998, Beehner <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, in the absence of more detailed data regarding current geographic range and demographic trends, the species remains listed as Least Concern.</p>  <a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Geladas are associated with Afroalpine grasslands and adjacent rocky gorges and precipices (Bergman and Beehner 2013). This species feeds mainly on the flat margins of high grass plateaus, known locally as high Wurch or Puna grassland steppe, with <em>Agrostis</em> and <em>Festuca</em> grasses and giant <em>Lobelia</em> groves. Gelada bands consist of 30–289 animals, subdivided into 5–26 one-male units (Bergman and Beehner 2013, Abu <em>et al. </em>2018). Bands keep within 2 km of the escarpment edges, where they retreat at night to sleep or if alarmed (Fashing &amp; Nguyen 2016). Typical annual home-range size for Geladas is 9–12&#160;km²&#160;(Hunter 2001, Moua 2015). Geladas are poor tree-climbers and are almost entirely terrestrial, partly a consequence of their unusual dietary specialization as a grazer (Dunbar 1983).<br/><br/>Geladas feed primarily on the leaves of graminoids (grasses and sedges) and also forbs (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). They also excavate and consume subterranean foods including roots, corms, tubers and rhizomes (Fashing <em>et al</em>. 2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey<em> et al.</em> 2018), especially during the dry season when green vegetation is less abundant (Fashing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). Invertebrates are eaten opportunistically (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2010, 2014), and cereal crops may be taken where agriculture encroaches onto the Geladas' habitat (Abu <em>et al. </em>2018, Jarvey <em>et al</em>. 2018).","<p>The overall range of the Gelada is being eroded by agricultural expansion resulting from rapid human population growth in the Ethiopian highlands. Conversion of Gelada habitat to farmland and livestock grazing is common (Bergman and Beehner 2013) and soil erosion is a serious problem throughout the region (Nyssen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grazing pressure is intense, and competition from domestic livestock has forced the Gelada to remain on the less productive gorge slopes in some areas (e. g. eastern Arsi) (Abu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gelada densities are considerably lower in heavily populated areas than in undisturbed habitats (R. Burke, pers. obs.).</p>  <p>Geladas are also harassed, shot or hunted with dogs as crop pests (R. Burke, pers. obs.) and occasionally sold locally as pets (Bergman and Beehner 2013). In the past, Geladas were trapped for zoos though this practice no longer occurs. Also, in the past, adult male numbers were reduced as a result of selective shooting for their capes of hair, which were made into ceremonial costumes used by the Oromo people (Dunbar 1977). The extent of this practice today is unknown. There are also historic records of Gelada capes being made into fur hats for tourists (Dunbar 1977).</p>  <p>Government-sanctioned trophy hunting of Geladas by tourists is currently allowed in controlled hunting areas, although the extent and impact of this practice are unknown.</p>  <p>Parasitic swellings caused by tapeworms (<em>Taenia serialis</em>) are a major cause of death in some Gelada populations (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2015, Schneider-Crease <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>Climate change poses a long-term threat to Geladas, especially for populations inhabiting higher elevations, where agriculture has previously been impossible or uncommon (Dunbar 1998).</p>","<p>Geladas are widespread throughout much of their present range, although they are probably not as abundant as they were in the 1970s, when an aerial survey of the central Ethiopian Highlands yielded a population estimate of 440,000 individuals (Dunbar 1977). A concurrent alternative estimate based on known ground densities from a small proportion of the Gelada’s geographic range and the total area of gorge face on the plateau yielded a figure of 884,000 (Dunbar 1977). Detailed ground surveys at five sites yielded overall densities varying between 15 and 69 animals/km², although densities of animals within their home ranges typically reached 70–80/km² (Dunbar 1977). A recent estimate for what is believed to be the largest remaining population of Geladas, in and around Simien Mountains National Park, was ~4,300 individuals, down from ~10,000 individuals in the 1970s (Beehner <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bergman and Beehner 2013).</p><p>While recent habitat conversion to farming and grazing lands has undoubtedly adversely affected the Afroalpine grassland habitats of Geladas (Fashing and Nguyen 2016), only further comprehensive surveys will reveal the extent to which Gelada populations across the highlands have changed since the 1970s.</p>",Decreasing,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Theropithecus gelada</em>&#160;is restricted to Afroalpine grasslands adjacent to deep gorges and cliffs in the Provinces of Tigray, Begemdir (Gondar), Wollo, Shoa and Arsi at altitudes between 1,800 and 4,400 m asl (Jablonski 2005, Gippoliti 2010).

Much like the study on Bonnet Macaques (a similar species) indicated steep declines in populations due to persecution and commensal populations becoming sinks over the last few decades, <em>Macaca fascicularis </em>is also suspected to have undergone declines of over 30% throughout its range in the last 36-39 years (three generations). Ignorance and lack of conservation action on an apparent ""abundantly"" seen species will continue to impact its status in the future, therefore we expect a reduction of at least 30% to also occur over the next 36-39 years.</p>","The species is extremely tolerant of a range of habitats, including mangrove and swamp forests, and can be found in agricultural areas near forest (secondary growth, secondary forest, and primary forest) (Thomas 1898; Fooden 1991,1995; Rabor 1986; Goodman and Ingle 1993; Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1991; Rickart <em>et al</em>. 1993; Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Nicobars, <em>M. f. umbrosus</em> is found in mangroves and coastal forests dominated by <em>Pandanus</em> species (Molur <em>et al</em>., 2003). <em>M. f. aureus</em> is found in evergreen forests and coastal mangroves (Molur <em>et al.,</em> 2003). The species has been reported as occurring to elevations of up to 1,000 m on Java, Borneo, and Sumatra (Indonesia), and up to 1,800 m in the Philippines (Heaney <em>et al.,</em> 1998). On the mainland, it generally occurs at lower elevations: up to 700 m in Thailand, while in Cambodia and Viet Nam it generally occurs below 300 m. This species is semi-terrestrial, diurnal, and omnivorous (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).","<p>Across much of the range, the major threat to the species is hunting. In mainland Southeast Asia, such as in Cambodia and Viet Nam, females are taken into breeding facilities and males are exported internationally primarily for use in laboratory research. A potential related issue is the release of confiscated long-tailed macaques from the border area of Viet Nam and China (which is where most of the current international trade is being recorded) into the native range of other macaque species. In the Philippines, the species is subject to a high level of hunting, where it is taken for local consumption and hunted for sport. It is also persecuted as a pest. Habitat loss is also a localised threat, but the species can persist in a variety of habitats and very adaptable.</p>","This is a widespread and often abundant species, and is sometimes commensal with humans. In the Philippines, it ranges from being locally common to uncommon, though this is largely dependent upon hunting pressure. In Bangladesh, the population has been estimated at less than 100 total individuals, and a population on the Teknaf Peninsula has been completely decimated due to development activities (ship-building) (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There is a paucity of information available on the population status of several island forms. Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2003) estimated about 4,800 individuals of&#160;<em>M. f. umbrosus</em>, but nothing is known about the status following the December 2004 tsunami. The islands of Katchall and Little Nicobar were submerged during the tsunami, and it is believed to have affected the habitat of this taxon; on the other hand, Shankaran&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2005) state that these macaques were not affected seriously on Greater Nicobar Island. The disaster could have impacted their populations on these two islands due to the fruiting&#160;Pandanus&#160;being affected by the tsunami (M. Singh pers. comm). The population on Con Son (<em>M. f. conderensis</em>) likely numbers less than 1,000 individuals, and a number of other island forms probably have a similar status.<br/><br/>In spite of its wide distribution, excessive hunting and persecution of this species is cause for concern. Studies of Bonnet Macaques (a similar species) indicated steep population declines due  to persecution and commensal populations being sinks over the last few  decades. For the same reasons, <em>Macaca fascicularis</em> is now suspected to be suffering similar population declines.",Decreasing,"<p>This species has a wide distribution, including Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India (Nicobar Islands), Indonesia (including Bali, Bangka, the Batu Islands, Bawean, Belitung, Java, Kalimantan Borneo, the Kangean Islands, Karimata, Karimunjawa, Lingga, Lombok, the Natuna Islands, Nias, Nusatenggara, the Riau Archipelago, Simeulue, Sumatra, Sumba, Sumbawa, and Timor), Lao PDR, Malaysia (including the Peninsula as well as Sabah and Sarawak Borneo), Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), the Philippines (Balabec, Basilan, Cagayan Sulu, Culion, Jolo, Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Palawan, and Samar), Singapore, Thailand (including offshore islands), Timor-Leste and Viet Nam.

In Pakistan this monkey remains in mountainous&#160; regions with forest cover; it is typically associated with Himalayan moist temperate&#160; forest (Roberts 1997). It is found at elevations up to 4,000 m (Molur et al. 2003).&#160; Due to hunting in Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species does not occur in commensal situations there, and is restricted to forest areas where it is generally&#160; associated with riverine environments over a range of altitudes (Timmins pers. comm.).&#160; In&#160; western and northern parts of its range it seems to occur in a wider array of environments.

While <em>M. mulatta</em> exists easily around humans, the increasing level of cohabitation has been associated with waning levels of human tolerance for the animals (Molur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Confiscation for laboratory testing is a mostly localized threat, but it is considerable in certain areas (A. Kumar pers. comm.). Capture and release of laboratory and “problem monkeys”&#160; from rural and urban&#160; areas into natural forests is a major&#160; threat to wild macaques.</p><p>In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the major threat to the species is hunting, although loss of forest in river valleys has also likely impacted the species (R.

Increasing hunting pressure for bushmeat and persecution as crop pests in many parts of their range are suspected to be causing a population decline. Habitat loss caused by mining, agriculture and human population growth is also a threat, but the total decline has not exceeded 30% over the past three generations (36 years).</p>","<p><em>C. sabaeus</em> occurs in riverine gallery woodlands, acacia savannas, Sahel savannas, Guinea savannas, savanna-forest mosaic, mangrove forest and at the edge of lowland tropical moist forest (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013). Temperature range is 1–57°C (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977).</p>  <p>Home ranges sizes are variable. For instance, in Saloum, Senegal, home range was reported as 138 ha (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976). In the Senegal River valley, home ranges are 157–164 ha (Galat 1983). Day range length is 2,000–8,000 m. In the Bandia Reserve, Senegal, day range can reach up to 11,000 m during the dry season, when the monkeys are searching for water (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). <em>C. sabaeus</em> is diurnal, semi-terrestrial and spends 28–61% of its time on the ground; 20–80% at 0–5 m height; 12–20% at 5–10 m; 2–8% at 10–20 m. On rare occasions, it climbs above 20 m, for example in <em>Dialium guineense</em> in Burkina Faso (Galat-Luong 1976, Galat 1983, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). Green monkeys swim readily (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976, Oates 2011, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p><em>C. sabaeus</em> occurs in multi-male/multi-female groups. In Senegal, troop size varies from 8 to 174, and large troops fission into one-male subgroups during the rainy and birth seasons (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977, Galat 1983). In Côte d’Ivoire, group size varies from 4 to 9 individuals (Galat and Galat-Luong 1980). Females of different troops guard offspring in common nurseries in large trees during daytime rest periods (Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).</p>  <p><em>C. sabaeus</em> is an opportunistic generalist omnivore (Galat <em>et al</em>. 2009). They feed on fruits (24–50%), leaves (28–50%), seeds (13%), flowers (3–13%), buds, young twigs, stems, bark and gum (11–15%), invertebrates (5–50%) and vertebrates, including birds’ eggs, birds, lizards and small mammals. Unusual food items include <em>Acacia seyal</em> thorns, fungi, bird faeces, and soil from termite mounds (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977, 1978, McGrew <em>et al</em>. 1978, Galat 1983, Harrison 1983). In the Senegal River valley, <em>C. sabaeus</em> were observed to prey upon <em>Arvicanthis niloticus</em>,<em> Streptopelia senegalensis</em>,<em> Passer griseus</em>,<em> Tockus erythrorhynchus</em>, eggs, <em>Lepus saxatilis</em>, lizards. They also dug out West African marbled lungfishes <em>Protopterus</em> <em>annectens</em> from their subterranean borrows during the dry season (Galat-Luong 1977, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Saloum mangrove, they feed on <em>Rhizophora mangle</em> aerial roots and prey upon fiddler crabs <em>Uca tangeri</em> (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976). In some locations, they crop raid and steal food from tourists (Galat 1983, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).&#160;</p>  <p>Territorial behaviour is related to habitat productivity and food availability. At sites with more than 500 mm annual rainfall, <em>C. sabaeus</em> occupies relatively small home ranges because productivity is sufficient to sustain a group in a small area. In rich environments, <em>C. sabaeus</em> live in small groups (less than 36 individual) in small home ranges (15–30 ha, with some local exceptions in less diverse habitats, such as plantations). In such conditions, a dominant male defends an exclusive territory using ritualized territorial displays. In habitats with less than 500 mm annual rainfall, food supply becomes more restricted because of low productivity and low predictability. In such poor environments, <em>C. sabaeus</em> lives in larger groups (up to 174 individuals) and has large home ranges (up to 140 ha). These home ranges are widely overlapping among groups without any territorial behaviour. Up to 300 individuals of different troops have been seen to share a large local food source simultaneously without showing any overt aggression. In smaller food patches, Galat and colleagues observed a form of queuing by subgroups (Galat 1983, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;</p><p><em>C. sabaeus</em> prefers to sleep in large tall trees with good visibility of surroundings, along riverbanks when available (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Senegal River valley, different troops may share the same sleeping trees (Galat 1983).</p><p>The natural predators of <em>C. sabaeus</em> are <em>Panthera pardus, Python sebae, Crocuta crocuta, Lycaon pictus, Pan troglodytes</em> and large eagles. <em>Caracal caracal</em>, Leptailurus serval,&#160;<em>Lupulella</em><em>&#160;adustus, Canis lupus familiaris</em> probably also prey on young green monkeys (Pruetz and Bertolani 2007, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).

Prevalence can reach 46% in wild populations (Galat and Galat-Luong 1997).</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Humans are major predators – <em>C. sabaeus</em> are hunted as bushmeat and killed to protect crops. Increasing hunting pressure and bushmeat traffic is affecting populations in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Sierra Leone (Ginn and Nekaris 2014, Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015). Green monkeys emit territorial loud calls at dawn and sunset, indicating the location of the whole troop (often a single large tree). This makes them easy to hunt; however, as hunting pressure increases and <em>C. sabaeus</em> density decreases, they adapt their behaviour and become quiet while dispersing into several trees, sometimes with as few as one monkey per tree. As a result, hunting becomes more difficult (A. Galat-Luong and G. Galat pers. obs. 1974–1976, 1988–2002).</p><p>There is evidence of increasing live trade as pets. In addition, they are persecuted as crop pests in many parts of their range (Wallis 2013). An exception is in Mali, where this threat is low according to Schleicher <em>et al</em>. (2014).</p>  <p>In addition to hunting pressure, habitat loss caused by mining, agriculture and human population growth are causing declines of populations across their range.

This species occurs in an area targeted for the use and expansion of illicit crops, which is currently reducing the species' range but has potential to become a greater threat. New highway construction and mining also pose additional future threats to the species. Based on a habitat model of museum records in Colombia, Ecuador, and  Peru shows a habitat reduction of 47% of their original habitat. Most  of the 30% reduction happened in the last ten years, at least in  Colombia, as result of severe deforestation and agriculture. Habitat  destruction has occurred for decades in the range of the Dwarf Red  Brocket. At least 50% of the expected range in Colombia is somehow  degraded due to colonization, deforestation, and burning for coffee  agriculture and cattle grazing (see Threats).","Records from Ecuador include ‘ceja de selva’, elfin forest, and grasslands (3,600 m), cloud forest / montane ‘Yungas’ forests, and sub Andean forests (1,400 m). Records from Peru include the same vegetation types as in Ecuador and Colombia, but without records in grasslands or over 3,600 m. The main habitat of <em>M. rufina</em> is paramos and tropical montane cloud forests above 1,500 m. The paramos are high altitude grasslands (Boom <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001), which are dominated by <em>Calamagrostis </em>spp. and gigantic Andean rosette plants from the genus Espeletia (Luteyn 1992). The tropical montane cloud forest is a type of vegetation that has special climatic conditions causing cloud and mist to be regularly in contact with the forest vegetation (Bruijnzeel and Veneklaas 1998). These forests support ecosystems of distinctive floristic and structural forms with lower canopy and thicker understory than lowland forests (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1963). <br/><br/>Along its distribution, <em>M. rufina</em> shares the same habitat with the northern pudu (<em>Pudu mephistophiles</em>) (Hershkovitz 1982); the mountain tapir (<em>Tapirus pinchaque</em>) (Lizcano <em>et al</em>. 2002); and the Andean bear (<em>Tremarctos ornatus</em>) (Peyton 1999). Details of its ecology are unknown, although it seems to be solitary, active by day as well as at night, and expected to be a browser/frugivore in the forest understorey. They are shy and secretive animals, rarely seen because of their nocturnal habits. They live either alone or in pairs and normally within a small territory. They usually defecate in latrines probably located at the boundaries of their territories. <br/><br/>The Brocket deer is a frequent visitor of salt licks (Lizcano and Cavelier 2004). In the Central Andes of Colombia its diet is composed of 40 species of plants mainly herbs, from which it prefers plants of <em>Solanum</em> spp. and <em>Begonia umbellata</em> (Lizcano 2006). They rely on their small size and knowledge of the habitat in which they live to escape predators, diving into thick vegetation when detected. Occasionally they present freezing behaviour before escaping. Nothing is known of reproduction or life in captivity. <em>Oxalis </em>sp. has been identified among plant species eaten by <em>Mazama rufina.</em> No research has been conducted to study the home range.","Habitat destruction occurs due to small scale cattle ranching and agriculture practised by local communities through forest cutting and burning of montane grasslands and shrublands. Illegal plantations of opium and Coca may be the main cause of habitat destruction in some areas of Colombia (Alvarez 2007). Mining, road construction and colonization expand habitat loss. Climate change might also result in area or quality decrease of available habitat for the species in the future, since cloud forests and paramos are broadly affected by atmospheric temperature increase (Foster 2001). Hunting occurs as a source of meat and medicinal products at the local level but needs assessment. They are preyed on by a small number of South American predators, such as puma and feral dogs.","Its density is low ranging from 0.06 (individuals/km²) in mature forest to 0.3 (individuals/km²) in ecotone paramo-montane forest. Its preferred habitats are paramo and forest-paramo ecotone over secondary and mature forest (Lizcano 2006). Collection sites in Colombia may be grouped into 3 to 5 locations distributed in the National Park Los Nevados, Las Hermosas, Nevado del Huila, and Doña Ana, and potentially in Pichachos, Macarena, Sumapaz, and Chingaza. Collection sites of Ecuador correspond to locations at Sangay and Podocarpus National Parks. In Peru collection sites are in and around Tabaconas – Namballe (Maravi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Current distribution and abundance need to be further assessed. A decreasing population trend is suspected from habitat destruction.",Decreasing,"Following (Czernay 1987) <em>M. rufina</em> is restricted to the Andes. It was originally found in montane forest and paramos at altitudes between 1500-3500 m.a.s.l. (Eisenberg and Redford 1999), from the Central Andes in Colombia to Huancabamba valley in northern Peru. It is currently restricted to remnant forest patches and paramos in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In Colombia it occurs in the states of Nariño, Huila, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Tolima, Risaralda, Quindío, Caldas, and Boyacá (Alberico <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). <em>M. rufina</em> has not been recorded for the Oriental Andes of Colombia (Cuervo <em>et al</em>. 1986, Alberico <em>et al</em>. 2000). Although <em>M. rufina </em>is not included in the list of mammals of Antioquia state (Cuartas-Calle and Muñoz-Arango 2003), photographic evidence of its presence and of its being hunted was recorded at the “Páramo de Belmira” in the Central Andes of Antioquia (Delgado-V. pers. obs. 2003), which is the northern most record for this species. In Ecuador it was recorded in the western and eastern Andes along the Chimborazo region axis (Tirira 2001). In Peru it is distributed on the eastern flank of the Andes in the watersheds of the Amazon river.<br/><br/>The southern limit of <em>M. rufina</em> is the Huacabamba valley which also acts as a biogeographical barrier for other mammal species (Hershkovitz 1959, 1982, Eisenberg and Redford 1999).

It is therefore listed Least Concern.,"<em>Ochotona rufescens</em> is most commonly found in rocky desert habitat, but may create burrow systems in fields where no stones exist.  <em>O. rufescens</em> also burrows in adobe houses and walls (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1990).  The species may be found in juniper forests and prefers habitats with vegetation cover between 30% and 60%, not higher (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1990). <br/><br/><em>O. rufescens</em> survives on a diet of native xeric plants, such as thistles, <em>Ephedra</em> and <em>Artemisia</em>, creating haypiles to store vegetation twice in each year (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1990). <em>O. rufescens</em> also consumes agricultural crops, making it a pest to humans in some areas (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>The reproductive rate of <em>O. rufescens</em> is high, with litter size averaging from 5.2 to 7.1, producing as many as five litters annually. The breeding season is long, from mid-March to late September, and young individuals begin breeding in their first summer (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1990).","Because <em>Ochotona rufescens</em> is considered a pest in some areas where it damages agricultural crops, it has been subject to control (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1990). The spread of agriculture also constitutes a threat, as habitat is converted to farmland, after which the pikas feed on crops, particularly by debarking trees in orchards (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>A population of <em>O. rufescens</em> on the Small Balkan Ridge may be endangered due to isolation.

Populations seem to be healthy, overall, although there exists some concern over range contractions, especially in the southeastern USA. The status of distinct subspecies along the Pacific coast is unclear.","<p>The Snowshoe Hare<em> </em>is associated with boreal and mixed deciduous forest of North America. It requires mixed forest with dense understory, which it uses as cover. Summer pelage is always brown; winter pelage color depends on snow duration and ephemerality and is white in most of the range, with winter brown morphs found in &lt;10% of the range almost all within a narrow strip along the maritime western Pacific coast of North America (Mills <em>et al.</em> 2018, Nagorsen 1983). Typically, stands aged 25-40 years are ideal. The Snowshoe Hare also seems to favor edge habitat. Diet consists mostly of grasses, forbs, sedges, and ferns (Murray 2003, Krebs and Murray 2018).<br/> <br/> The total length of Snowshoe Hares is 36.0 - 52.0 cm (Banfield 1974, Hall 1981). Their breeding season extends from March to September and is subject to photoperiod and hormonal control (Murray 2003, Zimova <em>et al.</em> 2018). The average number of litters varies according to location with 1.9 litters per year in Alaska and 3.8 litters per year in Wisconsin (Murray 2003). Litter size varies according to location and number of previous litters produced (Murray 2003).</p>","Southern populations may be subject to excessive habitat loss and  fragmentation, perhaps climate change plays a contributory role as well  (Sultaire <em>et al.</em> 2016, Zimova <em>et al.</em> 2016, Mills <em>et al.</em> 2018).","Populations of Snowshoe Hares are more or less continuous in Canada and Alaska, although patchily distributed in the contiguous USA.

Southern populations may be noncyclic or fluctuate with reduced amplitude (Krebs and Murray 2018, Krebs <em>et al.</em> Boutin 2018).

This may be related to habitat loss and increases in generalized predator (especially Coyote <em>Canis latrans</em>) numbers. Climate change is also likely to affect hare distribution and abundance, as decreasing snow duration increases camouflage mismatch of winter white hares on brown snowless backgrounds which in turn increases predation-induced mortality (Mills <em>et al</em>. 2013, Zimova <em>et al. </em>2016).",Stable,"The Snowshoe Hare appears in boreal and mixed deciduous forests of North America.

45198537,9561,Gulo gulo,Least Concern,,2016,2015-05-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The&#160;Wolverine&#160;is listed as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, remaining large populations, and the unlikelihood that it is in decline at a rate fast enough to trigger even Near Threatened. It occurs at low density and many populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (Ruggiero <em>et al</em>. 2007). There have been large past declines in some of its range but there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (Rowland <em>et al</em>. 2003). Thus although there is an overall continued decline due to human persecution and land-use change, the global decline of this species is not at a rate sufficient to qualify for categorisation&#160;even as&#160;Near Threatened&#160;as of 2015. However, in the mid-2000s&#160;the European Mammal Assessment determined that the European populations&#160;of Wolverine were in&#160;steep decline and would warrant a category of&#160;Vulnerable (A2c). Thus, the Least Concern global listing is driven by the large populations which remain in northern Asia and North America. Wolverine still faces&#160;some threats such as over-exploitation through hunting and trapping, predator-poisoning programmes and habitat resource extraction that caused the contraction of its&#160;historical range. More data on population trends, especially in northern Asia, might result in this species being re-assessed as Near Threatened or even Vulnerable in the near future.","The Wolverine inhabits&#160;a variety of habitats in the alpine, tundra, taiga, and boreal forest zones, including coniferous, mixed, and deciduous woodlands, bogs, and open mountain as well as tundra habitats (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em> 1999). Snow is generally regarded as an important component of its seasonal habitat requirements (Banci 1987, Hatler 1989). Wolverine habitat selection is negatively affected by human activity, including roads, infrastructure, and back-country recreation (May <em>et al.</em> 2006; Krebs <em>et al</em>. 2007). It has vast home-ranges (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1998), varying from 100 to 500 km²&#160;for males and 100 to 200 km² for females, and good dispersal abilities. Faecal DNA sampling has detected dispersal distances of more than 500 km (Flagstad 2005, Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2006). Hornocker <em>et al</em>. (1983) considered this species to be solitary, with large home ranges and extensive seasonal movements. It is largely nocturnal with some daylight activity&#160;(Whitman 1999).<br/><br/>The Wolverine has&#160;an average life expectancy of 4 to 6 years in the wild, with a maximum of about 13 years (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995). It reaches sexual maturity at 2.5 years. It breeds&#160;in early spring to late autumn with litters of 1-5 young (mean litter size: 3) born between February and April (Whitman 1999). <br/><br/>The Wolverine is&#160;thought to have evolved to scavenge from the kills of wild ungulates abandoned by other carnivores such as lynx <em>Lynx</em> and Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupu</em>s, as well prey animals felled by disease or injury. It also actively hunts&#160;smaller animals such as rodents, hares <em>Lepus</em>, musk-deer <em>Moschus</em>, roe <em>Capreolus</em>&#160;and wild sheep <em>Ovis</em>. Given the appropriate snow conditions it will also hunt larger animals such as moose <em>Alces</em>. Conflicts arise when Wolverines prey on livestock such as sheep or Reindeer. Given its&#160;dependence on other hunters for much of its scavenged food, the Wolverines is&#160;able to carry and cache large amounts of meat for later consumption.","Within its&#160;current range, extensive human activities continue to pressure Wolverine populations and habitat (Krebs <em>et al.</em> 2004). Overhunting (often by trapping), as well as predator-poisoning programs and resource extraction caused Wolverine populations to contract in the eastern and south-western portions of the&#160;species's&#160;historical range in North America since the early 1900s (Banci 1994).<br/><br/>The Wolverine is potentially locally threatened by its&#160;fragmented distribution and presumed low genetic diversity, as well as by 'population control' hunting and other consequences of perceived&#160;conflicts with people resulting from depredation of livestock. While this species inhabits a zone that is particularly affected by climate change (Rosenzweig <em>et al</em>. 2007), habitat change is not fast enough to be considered a major threat to it in the next three generations. Ample forest and tundra with suitable prey stocks are available throughout much of its range. A low rate of human land-use expansion into this range increases&#160;the frequency of interaction people, notably in conflict over livestock depredation. Given the remoteness of these locations, tolerance of Wolverines taking livestock is low and in some areas 'population control' hunting is used as a proactive means to avoid loss of animals. In Norway, where almost 10,000 sheep are believed to be killed by Wolverines each summer, government committees have instituted annual harvest quotas in an effort to control livestock losses; however, these quotas may not be sustainable as they are set very high even in relation to the most liberal estimate of Wolverine population size, and it is unclear whether this hunt actually reduces the numbers of sheep and semi-domestic deer lost to predators. <br/><br/>Wolverines are scarce in Europe today. Their continued survival is threatened because of their small and fragmented distribution, and the potential for their future survival may be weakened by the likelihood of low genetic diversity. Habitat loss <em>per se</em> is not a substantial threat. Large areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland are still covered by forests and mountains that offer a suitable prey base and habitat for Wolverine. These are not wilderness areas, and the&#160;species&#160;comes&#160;into conflict with a low, but crucial, number of human land uses. There are no large areas within&#160;Wolverine&#160;distribution with no livestock&#160;conflict potential. This results in a difficult situation for wildlife managers who are forced to try and balance Wolverine conservation against the conflicts with livestock. In Norway, farmers no longer use traditional sheep-herding methods that once deterred depredation, so Wolverines are often controlled in an effort to protect livestock. Poaching also occurs. In Russia, over-harvesting and declines in key prey species are threats.<br/><br/>1 and 2. The Scandinavian and&#160;southern Norwegian&#160;populations are subject to illegal killings because of depredation conflicts (sheep, domestic reindeer). The scope of this is difficult to quantify. Furthermore Wolverines are sensitive to human disturbance (settlements, public and private roads, etc.) especially near their dens (May <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;Most people in Norway are settled in southern Norway.<br/><br/>3. In the Swedish forest population/occurrence, high genetic similarity among individuals in the two areas indicates inbreeding, possibly including brother-sister matings (Hedmark 2006). Inbreeding depression and demographic stochasticity are therefore likely to be threats (Pimm <em>et al</em>. 1988). These forest dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of 'domestic' Reindeer, which form the most common prey for Wolverines further north (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1997). Establishment in the forest landscape is judged to be a way of reducing Wolverine&#160;conflict with the domestic Reindeer industry (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>4. In the Finnish – Western Russian population, about half the Finnish population lives&#160;within the Reindeer management area in the north (Kojola 2005), in conflict with this&#160;industry (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b) with associated illegal killings. The scope of this is unknown. The Russian economic depression during the 1990s is believed to have led to widespread poaching of ungulates, and to a reduction of the domestic reindeer herding industry through large calf/breeding losses. This is believed to have indirectly reduced the Wolverine’s&#160;numbers and distribution&#160;in the European and most human-populated part of Russia (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2000a, 2000b; Novikov 2005). In Russia the Wolverine is harvested for fur, apparently without harvest restrictions. Russia has not yet ratified the Bern Convention. <br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population is small and presumably isolated: it is likely that it will face inbreeding problems (Hedmark 2006) as well as being exposed to demographic stochasticity (Pimm <em>et al</em>. 1988). Inbreeding depression and demographic accidents are therefore main threats, especially because&#160;these forest-dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of semi domesticated reindeer.","Wolverine&#160;distribution and abundance reduced&#160;notably&#160;in the 20th century in the United States of America (Pasitschniak-Arts and Larivière 1995), and during the 19th century, species&#160;disappeared from the south of its European distribution mainly through persecution, but also because of deforestation and other human developments. After this&#160;substantial range reduction, there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (Rowland <em>et al.</em> 2003). Throughout its&#160;range, Wolverine occurs&#160;at relatively low densities and requires&#160;large home ranges, typically of 100-600 km² (Whitman 1999). Densities are never high&#160;(Makridin 1964,&#160;Aubry&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007), and it has been found to be less abundant than is Grey Wolf <em>Canis&#160;lupus</em>, even in optimal habitats (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995). Densities range from one per 500 km² in Scandinavia to one per 65 km² in Montana, USA (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995).<br/><br/>In North America,&#160;substantial populations occur in northern Canada and Alaska. In the USA outside Alaska, the population in Montana is considered to be the largest and most stable one, given its close proximity to healthy populations in Canada (Cegelski <em>et al</em>. 2003). Many wolverine populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (Ruggiero <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In North America, population density estimates range from one animal per 65 km²&#160;in Montana (Hornocker and Hash 1981) to one per 200 km²&#160;in northern British Columbia (Quick 1953), Alaska (Becker and Gardner 1992), and the Northwest Territories (Lee and Niptanatiak 1993). Lofroth and Krebs (2007) estimated densities in British Columbia using existing Wolverine distribution, Wolverine food, ecosystem mapping and human development data. Estimates ranged from 6.2 Wolverines/1,000 km²&#160;in high-quality habitat to 0.3/1,000 km²in low-quality habitat. Their total population estimated for British Columbia was 3,530 Wolverines.<br/><br/>The European population was recently&#160;estimated at approximately 2,260 individuals: 1,400 in European Russia (Novikov 2005), 150 in Finland, 326 (±45) individuals in Sweden and 269 (±32) individuals in Norway (Sæther <em>et al</em>. 2005). The southern Norwegian population was naturally re-established during the late 1970s and was a result of protective legalisation (Landa and Skogland 1995). To the east, the eastern Russian Wolverine population is believed to comprise more than 18,000 individuals (Novikov 2005). The species is not abundant in Mongolia, but still relatively widespread: it is only found in northern taiga habitats in Hentii and Hövsgöl mountain ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamsteren 1970), northern parts of Hangai Mountain Range and Mongol Altai Mountain Range (Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989). The European distribution is connected to the eastern Russian population along the Urals. The overall European population forms a relatively continuous distribution with five geographically distinct subpopulations. <br/><br/>1. The Scandinavian population has shown a low genetic variability and subdivision among populations indicating that the Wolverine in Scandinavia has lost variation through a previous bottleneck and that the current populations are the result of a recent common genetic background (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2001, Flagstad <em>et al.</em> 2004). A recent population estimate is of 580 individuals (at or over one year of age) with approximately 200 in Norway and 380 in Sweden (Larsson 2005, van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2005). The population has a continuous distribution and is narrowly connected to the Finnish – western Russian population along the border of the country of Finnmark in the northernmost parts of this population's&#160;distribution. An initial genetic analysis indicated a clear genetic distinction between these populations (Ø. Flagststad <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006). In its southern distribution, the Scandinavian population is a source for the&#160;southern Norwegian population (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2001; Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006) as well as a source for the Swedish forest population(s) close to the Gulf of Bothnia in&#160;southern Sweden (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>2. The&#160;southern Norwegian population was naturally re-established during the late 1970s and was a result of protective legalisation (Landa and Skogland 1995). This population has recently increased in numbers and distribution, but is currently kept at around 100 individuals by various control measurements (Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2006). Genetic surveys have shown that the&#160;southern Norwegian population is genetically distinct from the Scandinavian population, but the geographic gap between the southern and the main Scandinavian population to the north and east decreased from 100-200 km by the early 1990s to near-connectivity by 2006. Exchange of individuals is limited and the&#160;southern Norwegian population seems to form a sink (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b, Flagstad <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).<br/><br/>3. Swedish forest Wolverine occurrences were naturally established during the mid 1990s (Hedmark 2006). These new occurrences, in two localities,&#160;were probably established by as few as 2 and 2-4 individuals respectively,&#160;and by the mid 2000s&#160;consisted of  2 and 10 individuals, respectively (Hedmark 2006). Non-invasive genetic surveys showed that these occurrences have little, if any, contact with the main Scandinavian wolverine population (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>4. The Finnish – western Russian population, in recent decades, increased in&#160;size&#160;and distribution in Finland, but decreased in Russia (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b). The western Russian population is estimated to be approximately 1,400 individuals (Novikov 2005). To the west this&#160;population is narrowly connected to the Scandinavian population along common borders with Norway and Sweden. Initial genetic analysis indicated a clear genetic distinction between the Scandinavian population and the Wolverines in northern Finland (Ø. Flagststad <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006). It is unclear how the western part of this population (Finland, Kola, Karelia) connects along the narrow isthmus between the White Sea and Lake Onega in Western Russia. This area is judged as an extremely important connection for the northern element of the taiga fauna (Lindén <em>et al</em>. 2000) and these concerns should be further investigated. To the east, the European Russian population has a wide connection to the much larger eastern Russian population adjoining along the Urals in western Siberia. The eastern Russian population is believed to comprise more than 18,000 individuals (Novikov 2005). <br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population was established by translocating&#160;Wolverines from domestic Reindeer <em>Rangier tarandus</em>&#160;herding areas in the north during the 1980s-1990s. It is estimated to comprise&#160;about 10-15 individuals and seems to reproduce naturally (Kojola 2005). The gap between this and the Karelia distribution is about 200-300 km and little is known about exchange between these populations. This population should be judged as isolated from other populations pending further knowledge.",Decreasing,"Wolverine&#160;has a circumpolar distribution, corresponding with the Boreal zone of the northern hemisphere (Kvam <em>et al.</em> 1988). Its&#160;resident&#160;range reaches from Scandinavia across&#160;the Russian Federation (including Siberia),&#160;Mongolia,&#160;and northern&#160;China (provinces of&#160;Heilongiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia)&#160;to Alaska (USA), Canada and the western lower states of the United States of America (Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon and California)&#160;(Whitman 1999).&#160;During the 19th century, Wolverine disappeared from its&#160;southernmost European range mainly through persecution, but also because of&#160;deforestation and other human developments. In Europe the species is now found, mainly&#160;north of 60ºN, in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the European part of Russia.&#160;It is a rare vagrant (from Russia)&#160;to&#160;Estonia (T.

However, beca<u>u</u>se of&#160;its high spatial requirement, very few reserves will contain the full home ranges of more than a small number of individuals (Schreiber <em>et al.</em>&#160;1989).<br/><br/>European range states have different monitoring and management regimes varying from strict protection in Finland and Sweden, licensed harvest and control measurements in Norway to legal harvest year-round in Russia.&#160;In North America, Wolverine management issues include regulating trapper harvest, preventing human disturbance at denning sites, and mitigating for habitat loss and fragmentation (Krebs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).<br/><br/>Key conservation measures that need to be implemented revolve around minimising conflicts resulting from depredation of livestock, reducing legal and illegal hunting of Wolverines, establishing well-planned conservation areas and carrying out surveys to gain a better understanding of the&#160;species's&#160;population and ecology. <br/><br/>Farmers and local communities should be educated in and encouraged to adopt husbandry practices that will minimise depredation of livestock thereby reducing conflicts. Economic incentives could encourage farmers to conserve Wolverines on their land instead of hunting them. A compensation and education programme has been implemented in Sweden with Reindeer herders, where the herders profit financially from identifying dens on their land and protecting them; similar programmes could be applied elsewhere&#160;in the species's&#160;range. <br/><br/>Governments and researchers require a more solid knowledge of Wolverine&#160;population dynamics, prey relationships, habitat-use and distribution, to ensure that legal, government-permitted hunting quotas are appropriate and small, localised, endangered populations are protected. Better enforcement of laws that prohibit Wolverine&#160;hunting is required in applicable parts of the species's&#160;range, with higher penalties to discourage poachers. Governments need also improve coordination between wildlife conservation and agriculture programmes to ensure that conservation areas are established in regions with little risk of conflict with farmers and herders.<br/><br/>The Wolverine has been petitioned twice for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act in the conterminous United States, but the most recent petition was denied citing lack of information on distribution, habitat requirements, and threats (United States Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). In North America, the eastern Wolverine population continues to be Endangered, and the western population remains Special Concern. The&#160;species&#160;is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex II* and Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. European range states have different monitoring and management regimes varying from strict protection in Finland and Sweden, licensed harvest and control measurements in Norway to legal harvest year round in Russia.<br/><br/>1. The Scandinavian population is covered by both Swedish and Norwegian management regimes, which are quite different. However, both Norwegian and Swedish populations are monitored through annual counting of active natal dens (Landa <em>et al.</em> 1998) and non-invasive faecal DNA surveys (in southern areas). There is cooperation and data exchange between the two national programmes. The Swedish national interim goal is to reach a minimum of 90 annual Wolverine reproductions (requiring approximately 575 individuals over one year of age) (Riksdagen 2000). Sweden has international obligations through the Bern Convention for the conservation of the European wildlife and habitats, the regulation of trade through the European Council Regulation on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora, and the EU Habitats&#160;Directive. The Wolverine is in Sweden is officially listed as 'endangered' and is not subject to hunting. However, recently a few family groups have been killed in the purpose of reducing conflict with the domestic Reindeer herding industry in northern areas. Norway was recently (2003) divided into&#160;six&#160;different management regions with politically appointed management boards (Miljøverndepartementet 2003). The Norwegian national goal is to control the total population within the limits of 39 yearly active reproductions (21 within the Norwegian part of the Scandinavian Wolverine population) (Miljøverndepartementet 2003). The total of 39 breedings equals approximately 250 individuals &gt;1 yr of age. Control measurements, killing of family groups in early spring and licensed harvest is used as a management tool to restrict Wolverine distribution and predation on unattended sheep during summer and domestic Reindeer all year around. Wolverines in Norway are covered by the Bern Convention (Bern 1979) and as of 2005 were officially listed as 'vulnerable'. <br/><br/>2. The&#160;southern Norwegian population is&#160;subject to the&#160;same measures and legislation as the Norwegian part of the main&#160;Scandinavian population. <br/><br/>3. The Swedish forest population/occurrence is&#160;totally protected; also see description for the Scandinavian population for further details. <br/><br/>4. The Finnish – western Russian population is&#160;subject to different&#160;management between Finland and Russia. In Finland the species is monitored through a national fauna monitoring programme based on tracks crossing fixed 4x4+4 km triangles. Wolverine has&#160;been fully protected in Finland since 1982. In Russia, Wolverine,&#160;a game/pelt species, is monitored via tracking surveys and numbers are estimated based on daily pats and a calculation coefficient (Novikov 1994, 2005).<br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population, which is&#160;small and introduced, seems to function without the presence of semi-domesticated Reindeer, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, or lynx <em>Lynx</em>. Across the country the&#160;species has been&#160;fully protected since 1982.&#160;A research project comparing nutritional ecology of Wolverines within the three national areas of the&#160;species's&#160;distribution has been initiated. A future aim is to develop non-invasive molecular genetic monitoring of&#160;Finland&#160;Wolverines, similar to that conducted in Scandinavia (Kojola 2005).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

While declines occurred in some regions in the past due to overexploitation, it can be assumed that the population has not been reduced by more than 50% relative to three generations ago (Red List criterion A1 for Vulnerable), given that the estimated catches, including net catches, taken during 1951-2017 (three generations of 22 years) sum to less than 180,000. The models used by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee to assess the populations predict that the population has been recovering in the North Atlantic and is still declining in the western North Pacific, but work is underway to compare these predictions with recent empirical data. The Common Minke Whale is listed as Least Concern.<br/></p>  <p></p>","<p>The Common Minke Whale occurs in both coastal and offshore waters and exploits a variety of prey species in different areas according to availability.<br/><br/>In the North Atlantic, studies in Icelandic shelf waters showed a decrease during in 2003-07 in Sandeels (Ammodytidae), krill (Euphausiacea) and Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) relative to previous years, and a corresponding increase in Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>) and Haddock (<em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em>). I<span lang=""EN-GB"">n Norwegian waters in 2000-2004, krill dominated the diet near Svalbard, while Capelin dominated the diet around Bear Island and contributed considerably to the diet along the coast of northern Norway, along with Herring and Haddock. The diet in the Norwegian Sea consisted of mainly of Herring, while the diet in the North Sea was dominated by Sandeels and Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>) (Windsland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Minke Whales caught off Newfoundland during 1966-72 contained mainly Capelin (Mitchell 1974).<br/><br/>In the offshore northwestern Pacific, the diet during 1996-2014 consisted mainly of Japanese Anchovy (<em>Engraulis japonicus</em>), Pacific Saury (<em>Cololabis saira</em>), and Walleye Pollock <em>(Gadus chalcogrammus</em>). Krill (<em>Euphausia pacifica</em>) and squid (Tamura <em>et al</em>. 2016a). In some of the Japanese coastal areas, Pacific Sandlance (<em>Ammodytes personatus</em>) is also important (Tamura <em>et al</em>. 2016b). In the Okhotsk Sea the diet was dominated by krill (Lindstrøm <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Feeding habits of the Dwarf Minke Whale are poorly known. The stomach contents of an individual bycaught in Brazil contained exclusively krill (<em>Euphausia similis</em>) (Secchi <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>All Minke Whales are subject to predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), and tend to flee at high speed to evade them (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Minke Whales' apparently dispersed distribution outside the summer feeding season may be an adaptation to Killer Whale predation pressure (Ford and Reeves 2008).<br/><br/>With the exception of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea population, conception and birth in Common Minke Whales is believed to occur in winter. Most animals occur singly, and few in groups of more than two. The reproductive cycle of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea stock (the J stock) appears to be four months out of phase with other North Pacific Minke Whales, with conceptions occurring in October-November instead of February-March for the Okhotsk Sea – West Pacific population (Omura and Sakiura 1956, Kato 1992). This is the only known case of breeding asynchrony in baleen whale populations from the same hemisphere.<br/><br/> Methods of age determination have been developed only recently for this species (Maeda <em>et al</em>. 2018) and a direct estimate of generation time is not yet available. The limited number of individual age estimates obtained to date (Maeda <em>et al</em>. 2017) is consistent with a female age at first reproduction of 8 years as estimated from inter-specific comparisons by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007). Hence, the Taylor <em>et al</em>. generation time estimate of 22 years is plausible. </p>","<p>Whaling on Common Minke Whales was intensive in the northeastern Atlantic especially during 1940-83, when it reduced the population by about half (IWC 2018a). Commercial catches were phased out during 1984-87, but resumed at a reduced level in Norwegian waters in 1992 and in Icelandic waters in 2002, initially under scientific permits (IWC 2018c). The IWC Scientific Committee has approved in principle catch levels for North Atlantic Minke Whales according to its Revised Management Procedure, but catch limits are set at national level using a modified version of the procedure that allows higher limits (IWC 2018a). However, the catches actually taken have on average been below the limits set.<br/><br/>“Aboriginal subsistence whaling” has continued uninterrupted in Greenlandic waters since the 1960s. The IWC Scientific Committee regularly reviews the situation and has advised that the currently allowed levels of take of Common Minke Whales will not harm the population (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>Catches by whaling vessels in the North Pacific peaked in the mid-1970s when the annual catch exceeded 1,500, and were phased out over 1983-87 with the coming into effect of the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling's moratorium on commercial whaling, but resumed in 1994 under a scientific permit issued by the Government of Japan. Since 2014, active whaling on Common Minke Whales has been limited to coastal operations off the Pacific coast of Japan (IWC 2018b). Net catches, including incidental catches in fisheries, do not count as “whaling” and are not regulated by the IWC, but are taken into account in the IWC Scientific Committee's assessments of population status and sustainable take levels. Net catches increased during the 1980s and have continued off Japan and Korea, and possibly also off China. The IWC Scientific Committee has expressed concern over the sustainability of takes from the autumn-breeding Sea of Japan–Yellow Sea–East China Sea population (IWC 2009), and most of its population projections predict a continuing decline of this population (IWC 2014). However, the Committee in 2017 recommended that the projection model be revised to ensure consistency with available information on recent trends in abundance (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>Outside of the western North Pacific region, reported entanglements of Minke Whales in fishing gear are few in relation to the apparent overall abundance of the species (e.g., 6.5/year on the eastern U.S. seaboard, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Reports of ship strikes on this species are also few (e.g., 1.6/year on the eastern U.S. seaboard, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although most ship strikes probably go undetected or unreported, the data suggest that this species may be less vulnerable to shipping than are the larger whale species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em> </em><br/></strong>The IWC traditionally recognizes four stocks of Minke Whales in the North Atlantic: Northeast Atlantic, Central North Atlantic, West Greenland, and Canadian East Coast (which includes the U.S. east coast) but the evidence for these is equivocal. Recent genetic analyses suggest that there may be just two main breeding populations, whose winter distributions are unknown and which mix on the summer feeding grounds (Anderwald <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The latest review of abundance, catches, and population structure was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (IWC 2018a). The Committee’s review resulted in stock structure hypotheses involving 1, 2, or 3 breeding stocks being considered equally plausible.<br/><br/>Population estimates for this species by area have been variable over time (IWC 2017), probably mainly due to changes in distribution, but possibly also affected by methodological issues. The most recent estimates from surveys conducted during 2007-2015 in the main summer range are: <br/></p><ul><li>US waters (Virginia to lower Bay of Fundy): 2,591 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.81) in 2011 (Palka 2012); <br/></li><li>Canadian Atlantic waters and Gulf of St Lawrence: 20,741 (CV 0.30) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin, 2011); <br/></li><li>West Greenland: 5,095 (CV 0.46), East Greenland: 2,762 (CV 0.47) (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); <br/></li><li>central North Atlantic pelagic: 6,306 (CV 0.35), Iceland coastal: 12,710 (CV 0.53) in 2015 (IWC 2018a); <br/></li><li>Jan Mayen: 10,991 (CV 0.36) in 2010; <br/></li><li>West Svalbard: 5,009 (CV 0.29) in 2008; <br/></li><li>East Svalbard: 22,281 (CV 0.18) in 2008; <br/></li><li>Barents Sea: 34,125 (CV 0.34) in 2013; <br/></li><li>Norwegian Sea and Faeroes: 21,218 (CV 0.32) in 2011; <br/></li><li>British Isles and North Sea: 12,808 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (excluding most of Irish waters) (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017).</li></ul>These total about 156,000 with a nominal CV of 0.12.<br/><br/>Pre-modern catches of&#160;Minke Whales in the North Atlantic are known to have occurred but were probably small (Holt 1988). Recorded catches from modern whaling begin around 1930 and total just under 150,000 whales (Allison 2017). The most intense whaling on this species took place&#160;in the northeast Atlantic during 1941-83, when over 100,000 whales were taken. Simulations of the population indicate that it was reduced by about half during this period (IWC 2018a). The decline in the population was noticed at the time from the decline in catches per whaling vessel per day (IWC 1984). Commercial catches were phased out during 1984-87, but were resumed in 1993 at a reduced level and continue to this day. Catches by indigenous hunters continue in West Greenland waters, and in small numbers off East Greenland. The average annual catch of Minke Whales in the North Atlantic during 2013-17 was about 800, taken mainly in Norwegian waters (IWC 2018b). The population is predicted to have partially recovered from the past period of high catches (IWC 2018a) but abundance estimates have been too variable to corroborate this.<em><br/><br/><strong>Western North Pacific</strong></em><strong><em></em><br/></strong>The IWC recognizes three management areas in the North Pacific: Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea; Okhotsk Sea – West Pacific (west of 180°); and “Remainder” (east of 180°). However recent work has focused on delineating the range of the ‘J stock', which is now known to include the near-shore waters of the Pacific coast of Japan, mainly within 20 km of shore, where animals from this stock are partially sympatric with other Minke Whales, and are subject to direct and incidental takes (see Geographic Range).<br/><br/>The latest review of abundance, catches, and population structure of Minke Whales in the western North Pacific was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2013 and resulted in a number of alternative hypotheses for the population structure in this region being treated as plausible, without consensus on all of them (IWC 2014). The most recent abundance estimates accepted by the IWC Scientific Committee for the western North Pacific (west of 170°E) derive from data collected during 2005-12 and total 27,000 animals (CV 0.16), of which about 60% were in the Okhotsk Sea (Allison <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Minke Whales have been caught in nets on the Japanese coast at least since the 17th century (Kasuya 2009), and net catches have continued in modern times alongside direct hunting (Kim 1999, Toboyama <em>et al</em>. 1992). Estimated catches in the western North Pacific since 1946 total about 60,000 Minke Whales, of which 38,000 were taken by whaling operations and 22,000 in nets (Allison 2014, IWC 2018b). These were taken primarily off Japan and Korea, plus a limited number of catches off China and some offshore catches. Catches in recent years have declined to about 250 per year, taken mainly in nets (Japan 2014-17, Korea 2013-17). The Korean fisheries catching Minke Whales are described by Song <em>et al</em>. (2010); most of the catches were in set nets, gill nets or pots. The IWC Scientific Committee has in the past expressed concern about incomplete reporting of net catches, especially as genetic capture-recapture analyses of meat market products suggested that more individuals were entering the markets than were reported caught (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2007, IWC 2009), but has since agreed on revised estimates of the net catch (Allison 2014).<br/><br/>Most of the net catch has been from J stock, given that genetic sampling of markets has shown that nearly all the products sold in Korea and nearly half the products sold from Japan have been from that stock (Lukoschek <em>et al</em>. 2009). The IWC Scientific Committee has in the past expressed particular concern on the effects of catches on the J stock, which had already been depleted by past catches (IWC 2009). The latest assessment by the Committee predicts continuing decline in the J stock (and in the Yellow Sea stock, if it is separate from the J stock) under most of the scenarios examined (IWC 2014). However, the trend has not been corroborated by other evidence, and the Scientific Committee has called for the assessments to be updated to take account of auxiliary information (IWC 2018c).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong></em><strong> (east of 180°E)</strong><br/>Minke Whale densities in the eastern North Pacific are generally lower than in the western region: for example, 636 (CV 0.72) for the U.S. west coast during 2008-14 (Barlow 2016), 522 (CV 0.30) for the waters of British Columbia during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al</em>. 2015), 2,020 (CV 0.73) for the eastern Bering Sea shelf (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013), and 1,232 (CV 0.34) for coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska and the eastern and central Aleutian Islands (Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2006). Only 12 Minke Whales were seen in the international POWER surveys of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska north of 40°N east of 170°E during 2010-12, and none were seen south of 40°N during 2013-16 (IWC 2018d). <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GD_1;mso-comment-date: 20180319T1738"">However, because Minke Whales were not a target species and surveys continued in sea states considerably above those suitable for observing this species, no abundance estimate has been calculated (IWC 2016).</a><em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>It is not possible at this time to estimate the abundance of <em>B. acutorostrata</em> in the Southern Hemisphere, because most of the available quantitative sighting data do not distinguish it from the more numerous <em>B. bonaerensis</em> with which it is partially sympatric. <em>B. acutorostrata</em> has not been subject to significant exploitation in the Southern Hemisphere. Of more than 1,700 Minke Whales taken by Antarctic pelagic whaling from the 1987/88 to the 1992/93 season (when the two species have been reliably distinguished), only 16 were Dwarf Minke Whales (Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. 2005). One was taken at 65°S and the remainder between 55° and 62°S, 55°S being the northern limit of whaling operations. Surveys of the Antarctic Peninsula in summer during 1994-2008 found only 11 Dwarf Minke Whales versus 519 Antarctic Minke Whales (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the IDCR/SOWER series of international cetacean surveys south of 60°S, only 0.2% of Minke Whale sightings were <em>B. acutorostrata</em> (Branch and Butterworth 2001).",Unknown,"<p>The Common Minke Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all oceans and in nearly all latitudes, from nearly 70°S to 80°N. It occurs in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, throughout the Southern Hemisphere and possibly also in the northern Indian Ocean. At least parts of the populations migrate to lower latitudes in winter, but there are no known areas of regular winter aggregation, except at the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, where Dwarf Minke Whales congregate in winter (Arnold 1997) and support a local swim-with tourism industry (Curnock <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is likely that the winter distribution of most Common Minke Whales is highly dispersed. The species can be hard to spot at sea except in fairly calm conditions but it is possible to detect its presence acoustically thanks to the confirmed identification of certain underwater sounds made by this species (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic (B. a. acutorostrata)</em><br/></strong>In summer, Minke Whales are common throughout the northern North Atlantic as far north as Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, Svalbard (Norway), Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya, and as far south as 40°N on the U.S. east coast (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and as far south as the western English Channel and the central North Sea in Europe (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the mid-Atlantic, summer concentrations of Minke Whales occur to at least as far south as 50°N (Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>. 1991). It is possible that at least a part of the Minke Whale population over-winters in the summer range, but there has been little observation effort in winter to confirm this.<br/><br/>Minke Whales also occur south of the above described range in the southeastern North Atlantic, but with no obvious seasonality and not commonly seen, with the exception of the Canary Islands where they occur year-round (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999). There have been occasional sightings and strandings off Spain and Portugal, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, and the Cape Verde Islands (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 1983, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999, Hazevoet <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). Minke Whales occur regularly in the Azores, apperently year-round but in low numbers (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011, Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014) and are occasionally seen off Maderia (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Minke Whale is considered a “visitor species” in the Mediterranean (average &lt;1 record per year) with one vagrant recorded in the Black Sea (Reeves and Notabartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/> <br/> There are few winter sightings, but a summary by Mitchell (1991) indicates that Minke Whales do occur in winter near Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Antilles, and along the U.S. coast south of 40°N. A Norwegian winter expedition sent to the tropical Atlantic in 1989/90 to “find the breeding grounds of the Minke Whale” encountered just two at 20°N and 10°N off West Africa in December (Folklow and Blix 1991). Ten strandings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson and Schiro 1997) but very few live sightings. Minke Whales were detected off Puerto Rico in an acoustic survey in 1994 (Mellinger <em>et al</em>. 2000). A whale was satellite-tagged off western Iceland in August 2004 and tracked past the Azores to about 25°N by December before contact was lost (Víkingsson and Jørgensen 2015).<br/><br/>Acoustic monitoring from sites spaced along the mid-Atlantic ridge and the U.S. eastern seaboard, and in the eastern Caribbean showed the presence of Minke Whales in winter (November to March) at sites south of about 35°N, and only in other seasons at sites further north; these data suggest seasonal migration, but with different corridors for the spring and autumn migrations (Risch <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific (B. a. scammoni)</em></strong><br/>Minke Whales occur in summer all across the North Pacific north of about 30°N in summer, with a tendency for the distribution to shift northward in mid-summer. They are particularly abundant in the Okhotsk Sea in August (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996a), and also occur in the Bering Sea, around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2002, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2006) and the Chukchi Sea (Ivashin and Votrogov 1981).<br/><br/>In the western North Pacific, there are at least two distinct subpopulations, and possibly more. The so-called “J stock” is an autumn-breeding population that occurs in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, and along the Pacific coast of Japan within 20nm of the coast, with some penetration into the Okhotsk Sea. The ""O stock,"" which like most baleen whales breeds in winter, occurs in summer in the northwestern Pacific, including off the northeastern coasts of Japan and in the Okhotsk Sea (Omura and Sakiura 1956, Kato 1992, Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2009). Minke Whales in the Yellow Sea may be distinct from the remainder of J stock (Wade <em>et al</em>. 2010, IWC 2014).<br/> <br/> The winter distribution in the western North Pacific is poorly known. Japanese expeditions to look for wintering grounds in the southwestern North Pacific during 1993-95 failed to locate any Minke Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996b). The timing of the arrival of Minke Whales in Korean and western Japanese waters is suggestive of migration from the south in spring and return in autumn (Ohsumi 1983). Minke Whales were detected acoustically at low densities around the Mariana Islands in winter and spring 2007 (Norris <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In the eastern North Pacific, there appears to be a year-round subpopulation off California and Baja California and in the Gulf of California, and Minke Whales occur in summer off Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Minke Whales have for many years been detected both acoustically and visually around the Hawaiian Islands in winter but not in substantial numbers (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The wintering area in the eastern North Pacific (U.S. mainland to Hawaii) has been identified acoustically to be primarily between 15° and 35° N latitude, with a boundary at around 135°W between two populations with acoustically distinct signatures (Rankin and Barlow 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Northern Indian Ocean</em><br/></strong>There have been very few records of Minke Whales in the northern Indian Ocean and none of them have been confirmed (Brownell<em> et al</em>, 2017). Deriyanagala (1963) described a new subspecies of Minke Whale, <em>B. acutorostrata thalmaha, </em>from strandings in Sri Lanka but subsequent examination of&#160; the type specimen indicated that it was probably from a Bryde's whale, <em>B. edeni </em>(Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere (Dwarf Minke Whales)</em></strong><br/>Much of the data on the occurrence of Minke Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is ambiguous with respect to identification as <em>B. acutorostrata</em> or <em>B. bonaerensis</em>, because the two species are partially sympatric. Japanese scouting vessel data indicated high abundance of Minke Whales in November between 10°-30°S in the central South Pacific and in much of the eastern and southern Indian Ocean to 50°S (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996a), but the species identity is unclear. The limited information available from surveys in low and middle latitudes from the 1987/88 season onwards, when the two species were reliably distinguished, indicates that most of the Minke Whales were <em>B. bonaerensis</em> (Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. 1991), probably on route to the Antarctic from (as yet unknown) low-latitude breeding grounds, but that <em>B. acutorostrata</em> is also present in these latitudes.<br/><br/>Dwarf Minke Whales (<em>B. acutorostrata</em>) also occur at higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere but are much less common than <em>B. bonaerensis</em>. A winter survey in the Bellinghausen Sea in August 1993 found two Dwarf Minke Whales, including one at 69°25’S which is the southernmost record for this species (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). </p>  <p>In coastal waters, Dwarf Minke Whales have been recorded off most of the South Atlantic coast of South America (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1996, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the Beagle Channel (Chile/Argentina) (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006), and off South Africa (Best 1985), Australia (Arnold <em>et al</em>. 1987, Arnold 1997), New Zealand (Dawson and Slooten 1990), and New Caledonia (Garrigue and Greaves 2001). The most northerly confirmed Southern Hemisphere record is from 2°S, off the northern coast of Brazil (Magalhães <em>et al</em>. 2007). Three Dwarf Minke Whales were caught in whaling operations off Costinha, Brazil in 1980 along with 900 Antarctic Minke Whales (da Rocha and Braga 1982).</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Common Minke Whales were heavily hunted in the past, and hunting at a reduced level is ongoing in parts of the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The latest available Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade reports show 199 tonnes of Minke Whale products exported from Norway to Japan in 2016, and 110 tonnes exported from Iceland to Japan in 2013 (CITES 2017).

The moratorium does not cover net catches (which occur mainly in Japan and Korea), catches taken under Special Permits for scientific research (which, for this species, have since 2014 only been issued for takes off the Pacific coast of Japan), or catches for “aboriginal subsistence whaling” under IWC management (which, for this species, is currently practiced regularly only off Greenland). <em>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</em> is included in Appendix I of CITES, with the exception of the West Greenland population which is included in Appendix II. The Appendix I listing implies prohibition of commercial international trade in products, but such prohibition does not apply to Iceland, Norway, or Japan, who hold reservations on the species (see Use and Trade).

The IWC Scientific Committee has since accepted circumpolar population estimates of about 500,000 based on surveys conducted during 1993-2004 (IWC 2013). The population was estimated to have declined by 31% relative to the previous circumpolar surveys (1986-1991) but imprecision in the abundance estimates means that the decline is not statistically significant. In addition, an unknown proportion of the population would have been in unsurveyed pack ice habitat at the time of the surveys (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). The imprecise abundance and unknown proportion of whales in pack ice contributes to an overall lack of confidence in status determination based on decline rate. Because the decline may not have ceased and its causes are not understood, Red List criterion A2b for Vulnerable, for which the decline threshold is 30%, could apply. Given an estimated generation time of 22 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), the time window for application of the A2 criterion would be 1952-2018. In the absence of a decline estimate for the whole period, and lacking understanding of the cause of the suspected decline, the Antarctic Minke Whale is classified as Near Threatened (NT), approaching Criterion&#160;A2b, following the Red List Guidelines because the species represents a case where, considering all available evidence, Least Concern, NT, and Vulnerable are equally plausible.</p>","<p>While in the Antarctic, Minke Whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill), primarily <em>Euphausia superba</em>, but also <em>E. crystallorophias</em>, <em>E. frigida,</em> and <em>Thysanoessa macrura</em> (Tamura and Konishi 2009). Observed densities of Minke Whales are highest near the edge of the pack ice, but they also occur within the pack ice (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is not known whether Antarctic Minke Whales feed to any significant extent while outside the Antarctic on their wintering grounds or migration routes. Best (1982) found a very low level of feeding, almost entirely on euphausiids, by Antarctic Minke Whales taken in winter off Durban, South Africa. Antarctic Minke Whales may themselves be an important prey for type-A Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em> (Pitman and Ensor 2003).</p><p></p><p>  </p><p>The Antarctic Minke Whale is considered pagophilic (ice-loving) in the sense of being better able than the larger baleen whales to use habitat with high pack ice densities. The proportion of the population found within the pack ice is not well known but has been estimated at 10-50% in Area IV (southeast Indian Ocean sector) in summer (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p></p>  <p>Antarctic Minke Whales reach sexual maturity at about 7-8 years of age and the generation time is estimated to be 22 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>","<p>  </p>  <p>Whaling of Antarctic Minke Whales has not been as intensive as for the larger baleen whales. Substantial catches, apart from some experimental catches in the late 1960s, have been made by pelagic expeditions only since 1971, following depletion of the larger baleen whales. Nearly 100,000 Minke Whales were taken by pelagic whaling expeditions in the Antarctic during 1972-87, in addition to over 14,000 taken from the Brazilian land station at Costinha during 1964–85 and over 1,100 off South Africa during 1968-75 (Allison 2017). Since 1987, pelagic whaling continued under special permit at a reduced level. Nearly 11,000 Minke Whales were taken under such permits during 1987-2014. Catches were suspended for the 2014/15 season following a ruling by the International Court of Justice but resumed from the 2015/16 season with an annual catch target of 333 whales (IWC 2017).&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Sea ice cover in the Antarctic is predicted to decline by 50% in winter and 30% in summer (Cavanagh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and there is concern that this could negatively impact species such as Antarctic Minke Whales for which areas with sea ice constitute a substantial part of their habitat. </p>","<p>As for other baleen whales, the IWC’s management of Antarctic Minke Whales has been based on six Areas, I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50°–70° wide. The population structure is poorly known, but recent analyses suggest a genetic distinction between whales in the Indian Ocean sector of the Antarctic (west of 165°E) and the Pacific Ocean sector (east of this line) with presumably some overlap (Pastene and Goto 2016). With the exception of the two marked whales mentioned above, the relationship between the Antarctic distribution and putative breeding areas is largely unknown.<br/> <br/> Ship-based summer surveys of the area south of 60°S were conducted each summer from 1978/79 to 2009/10, under the auspices of the IWC Scientific Committee, as part of the International Decade of Cetacean Research—later Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research—programme, and covering a different area each year, such that circumpolar coverage was achieved &#160;every 6-10 years (IWC 2011). These have been used to estimate Minke Whale population sizes, on the assumption that the bulk of the population is found south of 60°S in the survey season (Branch and Butterworth 2001). The survey vessels do not enter the pack ice, where Minke Whales are known to occur to some extent (Williams <em>et al. </em>2014). Since then surveys have continued under a Japanese national programme in the southwest Pacific and southeast Indian Ocean sectors (Hakamada <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>  <p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p>The IWC Scientific Committee in 2012 agreed upon abundance estimates totalling 720,000 (95% confidence interval (CI)  512,000-1,012,000) for the period 1986-91 and 515,000 (95% CI 361,000-733,000) for the period 1993-2002, with a 31% decline between the means of the two periods. However, the confidence intervals of the two estimates overlap and the IWC report listed  a number of factors that could affect the comparison (IWC 2013). The Committee did not feel able to produce reliable estimates from the 1979-85 data. The Committee noted substantial inter-annual variability in the estimates over and above what would be expected from sampling variance, which is suggestive of genuine fluctuations in distribution (IWC 2015). The Committee has to date been unable to identify a definite cause for the decline, but has considered population models that are capable of reproducing the decline given certain assumptions (IWC 2015). Some evidence suggests that the pre-whaling population of Antarctic Minke Whales was lower than recent abundance (Mori and Butterworth 2006), while other evidence points to pre-whaling populations similar to or greater than recent abundance (Ruegg <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/></p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>The Antarctic Minke Whale is considered a Southern Hemisphere species, although there are records north of the equator from Suriname (de Boer 2015) and occasional vagrants as far as the Arctic (Glover <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; In summer they are abundant throughout the Antarctic south of 60°S, occurring in greatest densities near the ice edge, and to some extent within the pack ice and in polynyas. Particularly high densities have been observed in some years in high Antarctic areas such as Prydz Bay, the Weddell Sea, and the Ross Sea (Kasamatsu <em>et al</em>. 1998). Although Common Minke Whales have been found in the Antarctic as far south as 65°S they are much less common there than Antarctic Minke Whales (Branch and Butterworth 2001), such that all “Minke Whale” abundance estimates south of 60°S can for practical purposes be treated as estimates of Antarctic Minke Whale abundance.<br/> <br/> Although Minke Whales are seen outside the Antarctic in summer (Kasamatsu and Miyashita 1983) much of the summer data is ambiguous with respect to identification as Common or Antarctic Minke Whales, such that it remains unclear whether significant numbers of Antarctic Minke Whales occur outside the Antarctic in summer.&#160; <br/></p><p>The winter distribution is not well known. Some Minke Whales remain in the Antarctic in winter (Ensor 1989). Following the unambiguous association of the ""bio-duck"" call with Antarctic Minke Whales (Risch <em>et al</em>. 2014), it has become easier to detect their presence in winter, and it appears they remain abundant year-round in at least some areas, such as the western Antarctic Peninsula (Dominella and Širović 2016). There is a wintering area off Costinha, Brazil (7°S), where Minke Whales, almost exclusively Antarctic Minke Whales, were the target of a whaling operation during 1964-85, with the peak abundance in October (da Rocha and Braga 1982). Minke Whales were also seen (and small numbers caught) off Durban, South Africa: the seasonal distribution was bimodal, with peaks in April/May and September/October, suggestive of migration past the area (Best 1982). There are occasional records from Peru (VanWaerebeek and Reyes 1994).<br/> <br/> Japanese scouting vessel data indicated high abundance of Minke Whales (species ambiguous) in November between 10°–30°S in the central South Pacific and in much of the eastern and southern Indian Ocean from the tropics southwards to 50°S (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996). The limited information available from low-latitude surveys from the 1987/88 season onwards, when the two Minke Whale species were reliably distinguished, indicates that most were Antarctic Minke Whales, probably on route from (as yet unknown) low-latitude breeding grounds to the Antarctic  (Kasamatsu <em>et al.</em> 1995). The lack of any known areas of high concentration in winter suggests that the breeding distribution is rather dispersed and largely offshore. The species identity of Minke Whales seen in Indonesian waters in November (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996) is unclear.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p>Migratory connections between wintering and feeding grounds are poorly known. The recovery of two Minke Whales marked in the Antarctic in Area II at 62° and 69°S (Buckland and Duff 1989) by the whaling station in the Costinha demonstrates that at least some individuals from Brazil migrate to the Antarctic.

Catch limits for commercial whaling became zero from 1986 with the coming into effect of the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling. The summer range of Antarctic Minke Whales is also nominally protected by the IWC Southern Ocean Sanctuary, adopted in 1994, which prohibits catches south of a boundary located mainly at 40°S. Neither the moratorium nor the sanctuary provision applies to takes of whales under Special Permits issued by IWC member governments. Such catches continued from 1987 until 2014 when the International Court of Justice ordered a stop to the permit programme on the grounds that it was not for purposes of scientific research (Clapham 2015).

These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici<em>&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durant<em> et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003, Mills <em>et al. </em>2004, Cooper <em>et al. </em>2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall<em> et al. </em>2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker <em>et al. </em>2003c, Durant <em>et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir<em> et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis<em> et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe<em> et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al. </em>1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen <em>et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies <em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa,<em> A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel<em> et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for <em>A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase <em>et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Declines have been reported almost entirely across the species’ range. Also, genetic depletion of fragmented populations has been observed in Central Europe. Ongoing habitat destructions in more recently adhered EU member states such as Romania, Bulgaria and also Serbia, the latter also about to face an increased destruction of grassland habitats in the near future. The range and habitats of the species are mostly not protected and the accession of Romania to the EU has already resulted in agricultural intensification, which has also affected other steppic rodent taxa, and has a severe impact on the European ground squirrel. Further agricultural intensification is suspected to cause additional decline in extent of occurrence and quality of habitat within the next 10 years. Overall, known or suspected population reduction in the past, and suspected future population reduction likely over 50%.</p>","The European Souslik has quite specific habitat requirements. It is restricted to short-grass steppe and similar artificial habitats (pastures, airfields, lawns, sports fields, golf courses) on light, well-drained soils, where it can excavate its burrows (Kryštufek 1999, Spitzenberger 2002).&#160;Roadsides and river banks are very important habitats in some regions (e.g. southern Romania), where they are virtually the last remaining grassland habitats in large stretches of land, and could also serve as important corridors for ground squirrels and other grassland species.&#160;It avoids cultivated land, except for vineyards in some parts of its range (Spitzenberger 2002). It has an omnivorous diet including seeds, roots, shoots, flowers, and arthropods (Nowak 1999, Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).","The main threats to this species are the conversion of steppe-grassland and pasture to cultivated fields or forestry, and the abandonment of pasture and its subsequent reversion to tall-grass meadows or scrubby habitats which are not suitable for the souslik (Kryštufek 1999). In Austria it is therefore largely restricted to vineyards, airstrips, golflinks, sport- and camping grounds and other frequently mown lawns where it is completely dependent on the toleration of the owners (Spitzenberger 2002). In Bulgaria, colonies in the Sofia area are threatened by new road and building construction and in the Thracian valley the pasture habitat is being degraded (Koshev 2008). Although not a major threat, some Gypsy communities in central and eastern Europe still catch sousliks for use as a traditional meal (J. Mateju pers. comm. 2006).&#160;The bulk of European ground squirrel populations is currently found in four countries: Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. The former two are relatively recent EU member states, with drastically intensified agriculture and weak nature conservation legislature. With the EU accession of Serbia, it is expected that grassland conversion to arable land will be similarly drastic to the one experienced in Romania (Hegyeli <em>et al. </em>2014). Populations from Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic are highly dependent on the conscious and targeted management of their habitats, especially since grazing activity has shown a remarkable decrease with the reduction of farm animals, and since many colonies live in anthropic habitats such as airfields or golf courses (e.g. Matějů <em>et al.</em> 2010a).<br/><br/>In Austria intensification of agriculture has led to a decline of populations (Spitzenberger 2005). In Bulgaria pasture abandonment has led to a serious decline of habitats (Stoychev<em> et al.</em> 2004). Kryštufek <em>et al. </em>(2012) found the North Macedonian population to be threatened by pasture abandonment, spread of shrubs as burning. In post EU accession Hungary, the drastic decline of livestock and subsequent abandonment of grazing has led to sometimes irreversible deterioration of grassland habitats, leading to local extinctions or serious population declines. In Romania, many pastures traditionally grazed with cattle have recently seen a shift towards sheep grazing, leading to overgrazing and a more monotonous habitat composition, which probably affects the species. In this country, direct persecution is still an important factor: there is a high number of pest control firms which also undertake European ground squirrel control by means of poisoning and gassing of burrows, and in some places water management authorities use gassing of burrows to destroy populations on river embankments (Tihamér Fülöp and Zsolt Hegyeli, unpublished).<br/><br/>The role of fragmentation has been suggested by Řičanová <em>et al. </em>(2011), with important differences in allele frequencies between eastern and western population. Ćosić <em>et al.</em> (2013) have found that despite heavy fragmentation in Voivodina, genetic variation was higher than peripheral populations in Central Europe.<br/><br/>In the pannonian region of Romania, 40% of known colonies have been affected by transformation to arable land and 17% by constructions since Romania’s EU adherence, often within protected areas. In fact, inclusion in protected areas did not diminish these threats at all (Hegyeli <em>et al. </em>2014). Two projects aimed at ground squirrel and Saker Falcon (<em>Falco cherrug</em>) conservation (LIFE09NAT/HU/00384 and LIFE13NAT/HU/000183) have both had several protected target populations destroyed by illegal ploughing, despite continuous communication between the project staff and authorities. Destruction of grasslands as a result of agriculture intensification, forest plantations and constructions is still an ongoing cause of local extinctions, and an increasing threat in all lowland and hillside areas of Romania, even more so since grassland protection and nature conservation laws are rarely enforced. Baltag<em> et al.</em> (2014) found pasture degradation, building up and flooding to be the most significant threats for ground squirrels in eastern Romania. In the Voivodina region of Serbia, populations are also fragmented due to habitat conversion and infrastructure, and the small patches of suitable habitat are often outside of protected areas (Nicolić <em>et al. </em>2014).","Currently, the European Souslik is in serious decline. Its population has become fragmented, and extinctions have occurred in peripheral parts of its range in Germany (where it went extinct <em>ca</em> 1985 because of forestry) and Poland (where the last definite autochthonous records date from the 1970s, although the species has recently been reintroduced (Kryštufek 1999, H. Meinig pers. comm. 2006, A. Gondek pers. comm. 2006)). Although there are still some large and apparently stable subpopulations, there have been many reports of declines, especially in the north-western part of its range; it is also declining in the southern part of the range.&#160;In western Romania, the species (or its suitable habitats) could not be reconfirmed in 29 grids of 10x10 km (54% of all occupied grids), while this figure was 129 (60%) for regions east and south of the Carpathians (Hegyeli <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In optimal habitat, densities of 18-48 individuals per hectare have been recorded, although lower figures of 5-14 individuals per hectare are also reported (Kryštufek 1999).&#160;In Romania, a mean spring density of 110 burrows/ha has been recorded in Bărăgan region (Muntenia), and 136 in southern Moldavia, and even in 220 in Dobruja (Hegyeli, unpublished). Baltag<em> et el. </em>(2014) found lower densities across Moldavia (mean 15.4 ind./ha). In western Romania, summer burrow densities of 144/ha have been found, with slightly lower spring densities (projects LIFE09NAT/HU/00384 and LIFE13NAT/HU/000183).&#160;In Greece, populations of two subspecies (<em>macedonicus</em> and <em>graolojenici</em>) have been lost (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>In the Czech Republic there were 83 known localities in 1995, but by 2000-2001 only 26 of them still existed (Cepáková and Hulová 2002). Since 2001, there has been regular monitoring of <em>S. citellus</em>. Five new sites have been found, six colonies have disappeared, one was re-established due to reintroduction and one site has been naturally colonized following conservation  management. Fluctuation or stagnation of abundance has been observed at eleven sites, numbers of sousliks have steadily decreased at seven sites, and only in five colonies have populations increased. In 2006 the total number of <em>S. citellus</em> living in the Czech Republic was estimated at 2,750 (J. Mateju unpublished data). In North Macedonia the species is found in an area of 884 ha on Mount Jakupica, where densities (0.8–5.5 adults ha<sup>-1</sup>) are lower than those reported elsewhere for the species, and a total population of approximately 2,000 adults (Kryštufek <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).",Decreasing,"The European Souslik is endemic to central and south-eastern Europe, where it occurs at altitudes of 0–2,500 m.

Over much of its range, it is associated with fire-climax Miombo (<em>Brachystegia</em>) woodland. Both in this zone and especially to the northeast of its range, the species may also occupy dry bushland, thickets, steppes, and the coastal littoral (including mangroves). Fever Trees (<em>Acacia xanthophloea</em>) and Tortilis Trees (<em>A. tortilis</em>) are often used as both sources of food and shelter (Altmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Yellow Baboon typically forages in extended, well-spaced troops that may occasionally number up to 300 animals, though more typically average 30 to 80 individuals. The species is not territorial but, instead, uses home ranges that may overlap with other troops’ ranges. They drink almost daily, so their ranges tend to include a water source within a half-day’s journey (Altmann <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Like other members of the genus, Yellow Baboons are opportunistic omnivores. They primarily feed on the seeds, flesh, and pods of the leguminous trees including <em>Acacia</em>, <em>Albizia</em>, mopane (<em>Colophospermum</em>), and tamarind, all of which are seasonal staples. They also feed on grasses, shoots, fungi, lichens, and a range of animal prey, including invertebrates, lizards, birds, reptile and bird eggs, and small mammals. The latter include other primates, such as Vervet Monkeys (<em>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</em>) and Northern Lesser Galago (<em>Galago senegalensis</em>) (Altmann <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Yellow Baboons prefer foods with unusual chemistry, suggesting that this species has acquired special digestive adaptations.

In fact, some troops have adapted to living close to humans and regularly visit garbage dumps for foraging. While wild-foraging groups may spend approximately 70–75% of their time foraging and travelling up to 10 km per day, baboon troops that exploit garbage dumps forage for only 35–40% and travel only 2–4 km per day (Muruthi <em>et al.</em> 1991).</p>  <p>Extensive review and summary of the Yellow Baboon’s anatomy, behaviour and reproduction may be found in Altmann <em>et al</em>.

This decline is ongoing and is likely to result in extinction of this species, projected to occur within the period 2020-2050 if nothing changes.</p>  <p>The Common Hamster's range has declined in almost all European countries. Local and regional extirpations and extinctions have occurred in 13 European countries and in both the European and Asiatic parts of Russia. These include nearly 67% of the range states for this species. The decline does not affect only West European countries, but also affects the global range with declines in Russia and the eastern part of its range evidenced. From the previous assessment in 2016 there has been an estimated decline in the species area of occupancy of 226,835 km² and a 468,634 km² decline in its extent of occurrence.</p><br/><p></p>","Its original habitat was fertile steppe and grassland, but it has successfully spread into a variety of anthropogenic habitats including meadows, croplands (especially cereals), and field edges, road verges and scrubby fallow areas on farms. In eastern parts of its range it is found quite often in gardens and orchards, in close proximity to human habitation. It is more abundant in these man-made habitats than it is in natural grassland. It prefers relatively deep, heavy soils, in which it digs extensive burrows. Its diet mainly consists of the green parts of plants and seeds, supplemented by invertebrates and, occasionally, small vertebrates. At high densities it is considered an agricultural pest in some areas (Nechay 2000).","The causes of the global decline are complex, are not fully understood yet, and there are many hypotheses attempting to explain the breakdown of the species. Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed.  The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered “island populations”.  Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek <em>et al</em>. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye <em>et al</em>. 2012; Neuman <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005; Reiners <em>et al</em>. 2014). Agricultural intensification—specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides—are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli <em>et al</em>. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).  Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston <em>et al</em>. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke <em>et al</em>. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations.","<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has undergone severe range and population declines in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, and now has a highly fragmented distribution in these areas. The decline of the Common Hamster's range and numbers covers its whole distribution range (see Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016 for detailed analysis with maps). Extirpations and extinction on local and regional scales have occurred in a number of countries including Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (Ambros <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bihari 2003, Demyanchik 2004, Ziomek and Banaszek 2007, Tkadlec <em>et </em>al. 2012, Sidorov <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rusin <em>et al</em>. 2013, Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is extinct in Switzerland (Hediger 1944, Mohr 1954, no recent records) and most probably in Georgia, where it was present in one locality (Vinogradov and Gromov 1952, Bukhnikashvili and Kandaurov 2004). To the best knowledge of the assessors, it was never present in Luxembourg which was listed as country of occurrence in the previous assessment.<br/><br/>In general, decline was shown in each country where monitoring of the species was performed. The relative occurrence of the Common Hamster before and after 1970 was compared in Russian, Belarus and Ukrainian provinces, and Moldova. Before 1970, the Common Hamster was abundant in 28 provinces, common in 37 and rare in 20. Today, the species is abundant only in eight and common in 27 provinces, but it is rare in 42 and extinct in eight provinces. Moreover, the species' range is becoming or is already fragmented, due to it vanishing from more than 75% of its range in Central and Eastern Europe. There are only seven fragments in eastern part of the range where the species is common or abundant: two are in Ukraine, one in Caucasus, two in Volga and Ural area and two in Siberia. Nevertheless, the most important fact is that population decline and fragmentation in general concerns the whole eastern range (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has a large global range, extending from Western Europe, through Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Kazakhstan, reaching as far East as the Yenisey river (Asian Russia).

This decline is due to a combination of factors: a continuation of accelerated annual rates of forest loss throughout the species’ range, studies that demonstrate the unsuitability of remaining forest habitat for this species, and an ongoing, unregulated pet trade of significant proportion.","This species occurs in humid forest in the south to dry deciduous forest in the north; recorded from primary and secondary forests. Known at altitudes up to 400 m, but could occur in higher elevations (to 1,500 m) in the upper valley of the Río Sinu (Defler 2004).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus</em> and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) does not provide for gouging, and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8. <em>Saguinus oedipus</em> lives in groups of 2-9. Neyman (1977, 1979) observed groups of 3-13, Savage <em>et al. </em>(1996a,b) observed reproductively active groups that ranged in size from 3-6 and Gonzalez (2014) observed groups 1- 9. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. <br/><br/>Size:<br/>Tamarins are monomorphic (exhibiting only minor differences in body and canine size). <br/>Adults H&amp;B: 20.8-25.9 cmTotal length: 33.0-41.0 cm (Hershkovitz 1977)Weight: 416.5 g (n = 10) (Savage 1990).","The principal threats to the survival of <em>Saguinus oedipus </em>are an ongoing and apparently accelerating loss of suitable habitat and continuing live capture for the pet trade. According to the most recent data provided by Global Forest Watch, the annual loss of forest cover in all five Colombian departments in which this species is found (Antioquia, Atlantico, Bolivar, Cordoba and Sucre) has increased dramatically over the last three years, doubling and even tripling the rate for the previous three years. Should future generations of cotton-top tamarins suffer from continued loss of suitable habitat at the current rate (not accounting for any additional increase, which is certainly possible), projected gross forest cover loss throughout the species range could be as high as 30%&#160; in the next 18 years (three generations).&#160; However, ground-truth studies in protected and unprotected forests (classified as having the same density of forest cover) indicate the absence of large trees essential for sustaining cotton-top tamarins in the latter, estimates of gross forest cover loss will significantly underestimate the amount of suitable habitat available to this species (A. Savage, unpublished data).&#160; In addition, population losses due to live capture for the pet trade are difficult to quantify, yet the threat remains significant based on continued and documented confiscations by conservation organizations (R. Guillen, unpublished data), additional to reports of confiscations by authorities.&#160;&#160;<em><em> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><em>  &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; </em><p></p>  <br/><em></em>","In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 20,000-30,000 individuals were exported to the United States for biomedical research (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976). Current population estimates for the species are 7,400 individuals (approximately 2,000 mature individuals) (Savage <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).<br/><br/>A potential population reduction of 80% or more is suspected over 18 years (three generations; 2018-2036), due to and ongoing, unregulated exploitation of this species for the pet trade, and a continuation of accelerated annual rates of forest loss throughout the species’ range.

The long-term (~40 years) offtake at the Brazil-Colombia-Peru tri-border area, where 4,000 animals were trapped in a 24-month period for biomedical research (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2009), is reflected by the decrease of their populations mainly in Peru (Maldonado and Peck 2014).&#160;</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Nancy Ma’s Night Monkey is part of the red-necked group of night monkeys, with a diploid chromosome number of 54 (Ford 1994). They are found in flooded and un-flooded tropical forest. Higher population densities have been found in flooded forests owing to the availability of tree holes, their preferred sleeping sites. Lowland swamp, pre-montane forests up to ~1,000 m asl. and inundated dense vine tangles are also used by <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015; Aquino and Encarnación 1986a,b; Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Tahuayo River (Peru), <em>A. nancymaae</em> had 21.4% of its sleeping sites in the shrub stratum of the understory, 64.3% in the lower story and 14.3% in the middle story. No sleeping sites were found in the upper story or in emergent trees for this species (Aquino and Encarnación 1986a).<br/><br/>Night monkeys are generally nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk. They are omnivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flowers (seasonally important for <span lang=""EN-US""><em>A. a. azarae</em><span lang=""EN-US""> in the Chaco), leaves, and small animal prey such as insects (Wright 1989, Fernandez-Duque 2007). Nancy Ma’s Night Monkeys live in small groups that range from two individuals in hunting areas of north-eastern Peru (Maldonado and Peck 2014) to an average of 3.4 individuals in the Rio Tahuayo, northwestern Peru (Aquino and Encarnación 1988).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, with extensive male care of offspring (Rotundo<em> </em><span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em><span lang=""EN-US"">.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2002, 2005; Wright 1984, Wolowich and Evans 2007), living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult). There may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002, Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 1-18 ha (depending on the species, location and level of habitat fragmentation) (Wright 1978, Fernandez-Duque 2007,&#160;Garcia and Braza 1987, Castaño <em>et al</em>. 2010, Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2013a).

In Brazil, deforestation in Amazonas state is driven by the expansion of the agricultural frontier mainly for cattle pasture and soy-bean production (Barona <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Studies of illegal trade in primates for Peru have regularly encountered <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> in markets and other forms of trafficking (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although quantitative estimates do not exist, it is suspected that this trade is having a negative effect on populations in large areas of this species’ distribution.<br/><br/>The extraction of night monkeys for malaria research is drastically affecting wild populations in the tri-border area of Brazil-Colombia-Peru.

The northern boundary in Peru is the right bank of the Amazonas to the Río Marañón, occurring to the north of the Marañón between the ríos Tigre and Pastaza (Aquino and Encarnación 1994), invading the distribution of <span lang=""EN-US""><em>A. vociferans</em><span lang=""EN-US""> north of the Amazonas and Marañón. The western boundary of the species' distribution in Peru is the Andean foothills in San Martin up to ~1,000 m above sea level (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Colombia, the distribution of <em>A. nancymaae</em> is uncertain owing to the existence of a possible endemic subpopulation and an introduced subpopulation. Bloor <em>et al</em>. (2012) report the species north of the Amazon River, west from San Juan de Atacuari, border with Peru. Maldonado and Peck (2014) reported the predicted distribution of <em>A. nancymaae</em> in Colombia, where the species has been released after malaria research. Although the species is present all along the Amazon River, the distribution of the endemic subpopulation is limited to the Loretoyacu River basin. In Colombia its distribution range is approximately 652 km<sup>2</sup> (MADS 2015).</span></span></p>","Since 1984 <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> has been traded illegally from Peru and Brazil to Colombia for malaria research and later released to the wild in Colombian territory (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2009, Ruiz-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2013). Trapping permits for malaria research are granted by the regional environmental authority, Corpoamazonia, to the biomedical facility FIDIC, in Leticia, Colombia. SINCHI (the Research Institute for the Colombian Amazon) and the Genetics Laboratory of the Colombian National University – IGUN-UNAL - (CITES Scientific Authorities) conducted a pilot project to gather baseline information on the genetics and ecology of <em>Aotus</em> spp. where the FIDIC had been trapping and releasing animals. Results from the UNAL/SINCHI study confirmed the presence of <em>A. nancymaae</em> in Colombian territory and suggested the existence of a historical distribution of <em>A. nancymaae</em> north of the Amazon River, as well as of another population of <em>A. nancymaae</em>, not of historical lineage but probably introduced in Colombia in more recent times (Bloor <em>et al</em>. 2012). Bearing in mind the reduced distribution of this species in Colombia, ~652 km<sup>2</sup>, the study recommended the prohibition of extraction of <em>A. nancymaa</em>e in Colombia (MADS 2015). Nonetheless, in August 2016 the regional environmental authority (Corpoamazonia) granted another research permit for the capture of 1,463 adult <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> for a period of 566 days (Svensson <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is commonly found in Peruvian indigenous communities for exhibition to tourists and as pets (Maldonado and Waters 2017). In Peru <em>A. nancymaae</em> are regularly found in the illegal pet trade (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015).

For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The three-generation time period for applying criterion A is 70 years. Following the end of large-scale whaling in the late 1970s, some recovery of the population is inferred based on standard assumptions about the population dynamics. Recent abundance estimates for Sei Whales from the North Pacific are consistent with the inferred rate of recovery. There is little direct evidence of recovery in the Southern Hemisphere where the greatest declines occurred, but there has also been little monitoring effort there, and the recovery predicted by the population model is assumed. The species has been listed as Endangered, but plausible projections of the population size indicate that the global population of&#160;mature animals&#160;may have recovered to around 30% of the 1948 level by 2018. The corresponding extent of reduction, at 70%, is at the borderline between Endangered and Vulnerable under criterion A1. In view of the Red List rule that taxa should remain in a higher category of threat for five years after ceasing to meet the criteria for that category, the species remains classified as Endangered, but should be re-evaluated in five years, at which time it can be reclassified to Vulnerable unless new data cast doubt on the predicted recovery.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Sei Whales exhibit a greater variety in diet than some other large whales such as Blue Whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), but tend to feed on only one type of prey at a time. Whale stomachs examined in the northeastern Atlantic contained copepods and euphausiids (Jonsgård and Darling 1977). Of 21,713 stomachs examined from pelagic catches in the North Pacific during 1952-71, 82.7% contained copepods only and 12.6% contained euphausiids only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977). Sei Whale stomachs analysed in the eastern North Pacific off California contained euphausiids and anchovies (Rice 1977) and off British Colombia they fed primarily on copepods in some years and euphausiids or fish in other years (Flinn <em>et al</em>. 2002). Stomachs of Sei Whales taken by Soviet operations in the western North Pacific included copepods and euphausiids, as well as Anchovy, Sardine, Saury, Walleye Pollock, Mackerel, Capelin, and squid (Shuntov and Ivanov 2015). Some of these prey items plus euphausiids were also found in stomachs of Sei Whales taken in Japanese operations in the northwest Pacific in 2009 (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Of 31,494 stomachs examined in the Southern Hemisphere during 1961-66, 54.3% contained euphausiids only, 30.5% contained copepods only, and 14.4% contained amphipods only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977).<br/><br/>Studies have shown a clear differentiation between Sei Whale and Bryde’s Whale habitats in the western North Pacific, where each species favoured different ranges in sea surface temperatures and related covariates, Sei Whales being found in areas with lower sea surface temperatures (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2013, Murase <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, in other parts of the world Sei and Brydes Whales have been found to be sympatric in the same season (Gallardo <em>et al</em>. 1983).&#160;</p>  <p></p>","<p>Sei Whale exploitation by modern whaling was particularly intensive in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, following the depletion of Blue, Fin (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) and Humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) Whales. Sei Whale stocks were seriously depleted during this period. Exploitation in the North Atlantic occurred over a longer period and was less intensive, except in the eastern North Atlantic, where the population appears not to have recovered from early modern whaling. Commercial exploitation ceased in the North Pacific in 1975, in the Southern Hemisphere in 1979 and in the North Atlantic in 1989 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Catches by Japan under scientific permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2002. From 2004-2013, the annual take was 100 animals and was increased to 134 per year from 2017. The IWC Scientific Committee has advised that this level of take will not harm the stock (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>There are records of ship strikes and entanglements involving Sei Whales (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Henry <em>et al.</em> 2014), but it is unclear whether they constitute a significant source of mortality. Because of the Sei Whale’s offshore distribution, most ship strikes could go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Rice (1961, 1974) reported a pathological condition in several North Pacific Sei Whales that resulted in deterioration or loss of baleen; however, the current frequency of this condition, and its impact (if any) on the population, are unknown.<br/><br/>An unusual mass mortality of at least 343 Sei Whales that occurred in southern Chile in March 2015 is still under investigation but may have been caused by a harmful algal bloom associated with a developing El Niño event, the frequency of which can be expected to increase as the Pacific Ocean warms (Häussermann<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes three stock divisions for Sei Whales in the North Atlantic: Nova Scotia (including the waters off the east coast of the U.S.A.); Iceland-Denmark Strait; and Eastern (including the waters of Spain, Portugal, British Isles, Faroes, and Norway), but the divisions were chosen on largely arbitrary grounds (Donovan 1991). The West-Greenland-Labrador Sea area is not assigned to a stock division, but Sei Whales are present there. Genetic comparisons of Sei Whales from different North Atlantic locations found no evidence for population structure but did not rule it out (Huijser <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>About 17,000 Sei Whales were recorded caught by modern whaling in the North Atlantic (Allison 2017). In addition, a proportion of the approximately 13,000 unspecified large whales caught in the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would have been Sei Whales, given that the specified catch in the same areas in the following years included Sei Whales. Sei Whales appear to have been depleted in the eastern North Atlantic, with nearly 10,000 recorded taken in Norwegian and British waters prior to 1940 (not counting unspecified whales), but fewer than 250 since then. The species seems to be virtually absent there now: Norwegian surveys of northeast Atlantic waters in 1987, 1989, and annually from 1995–2009 have yielded only two Sei Whale sightings (NAMMCO 2010).<br/> <br/> A summer 2007 survey of the European Atlantic (an area west of British Isles, and Biscaya, northwestern Spain) yielded an estimate of 366 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.33) Sei Whales (Macleod <em>et al</em>. 2009). No Sei Whales were seen in surveys on the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, Sei Whales are still abundant in the central North Atlantic (Iceland-Denmark Strait IWC stock area), especially southwest of Iceland south to 50°N in summer. The only survey with reasonably complete coverage and designed specifically for the purpose of estimating Sei Whale abundance was in 1989, and yielded a population estimate of 10,300 (CV 0.27) (Cattanach <em>et al</em>. 1993). Areas of Sei Whale summer abundance seem to shift markedly between years, more so than for other baleen whale species (Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Sei Whales were among the most commonly sighted whales in a 2004 summer survey in the mid-Atlantic Ridge region, with a total of 53 sightings (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2008). The 2007 Trans-NASS survey yielded an estimate of ~5,000 (CV ~0.5) Sei Whales but covered a smaller area than the 1989 survey (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2010). Surveys of U.S. and southern Nova Scotian waters during 2010-14 yielded an estimate of 919 (CV 0.31) Sei Whales averaged (with inverse variance weighting) over spring, summer, and fall, or 849 (CV 0.42) whales in summer only (Palka <em>et al</em>. 2017). These estimates are similar to the estimate of 870 Sei Whales obtained by Chapman and Mitchell (1977) from data collected in this area during 1966-69. About 1,200 Sei Whales were taken off Nova Scotia during 1962–72. Surveys of Atlantic Canadian waters in 2007 yielded just two Sei Whale sightings, too few to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Chapman and Mitchell (1977) estimated the abundance in the Labrador Sea-West Greenland area at 965.&#160; <br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>The last stock assessment of North Pacific Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was in 1974 (IWC 1977). The “exploitable” population (animals of legally catchable size) was estimated to have declined from 42,000 in 1963 to 8,600 in 1974 (Tillman 1977). Over 40,000 Sei Whales were caught during this period, out of a total of about 70,000 taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century (Allison 2017). A 75% reduction in Sei Whale catch rates at California whaling stations during the 1960s is consistent with an ocean-wide decline (Rice 1977).<br/><br/>From sighting surveys conducted under the IWC POWER programme in July and August 2010-2012, Hakamada <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated 29,632 (CV 0.24) Sei Whales in the area east of 170°E. To this can be added an estimate of 5,086 (CV 0.38) obtained from national surveys west of 170°E in the same months in 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016), giving a total of about 35,000 Sei Whales.<br/> <br/> Assuming that the population was about 50% “exploitable” when commercial whaling ceased in 1975, the recent abundance estimate (2008-12, see above) would correspond roughly to a doubling of the population over the 35-year intervening period, representing a recovery rate of about 2% per year. Thus, the older and newer abundance estimates appear to be broadly compatible (see Supplementary Materials), but the relatively simple analysis of catch and whaling effort data by Tillman (1977) is no longer an accepted method to obtain abundance estimates.<br/> <br/> Sei Whales appear to have been reasonably common in the eastern North Pacific, with over 2,800 taken off Vancouver Island, Canada between 1948 and 1967 (Allison 2017) and 384 whales taken by Californian whalers between 1958 and 1971 (Rice 1977). The estimated abundance for the U.S. west coast was only 56 whales from surveys in 1996 and 2001 (Barlow 2003), but this has increased to 519 whales (CV 0.40) from surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>The IWC arbitrarily divides Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales, along with other Southern Hemisphere baleen whales, into six longitudinally defined management areas. Sei Whales in all six areas have been classified as Protection Stocks by the IWC since 1978. Over 200,000 Sei Whales were recorded taken by modern whaling in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905–1979. The largest catches were during 1960–72, when they exceeded 5,000 in every year, and exceeded 20,000 in each of the 1964/65 and 1965/66 seasons. Most catches were taken in summer by pelagic fleets operating south of 40°S, but winter catches were also taken from land stations in Brazil, Chile, and South Africa (Allison 2017). The catches by the former Soviet Union were grossly underreported at the time: 33,000 Sei Whales were reported taken during 1950-78, but subsequently records totalling nearly 60,000 were found and are included in the above figures (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The last assessment of Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was conducted in 1979 (IWC 1980). Some extra information on these assessments is given by Horwood (1987). Based on catches/sightings per unit effort from Japanese catch and scouting vessels, the “exploitable” stock size (whales of legal size, approximately 2/3 of total population), excluding Area II (South Atlantic sector), was estimated to have declined from about 64,000 in 1960 to about 11,000 by 1979. The population assessment method failed to produce an estimate for Area II, because nearly all the catch for this area was taken in just two seasons (1964/65 and 1965/66), yet the abundance indices suggested a more continuous decline during the 1960s and 1970s (IWC 1980). This suggests that whales move between management areas, and that these areas do not correspond to demographically distinct populations.<br/> <br/> Other available evidence also suggests a severe and rapid decline in Sei Whale stocks during the 1960s and 1970s. The catch and sighting rates from winter whaling operations off Brazil and South Africa show very sharp declines. Abundance indices from the Brazilian whaling ground for Sei Whales during 1966–81 (da Rocha 1983) declined by about 90% during 1966–72. Catch and sightings indices off Durban, South Africa for 1965–74 (Best 1976) declined by over 95%. Tag-recapture data from pelagic whaling suggested an approximately six-fold decline between 1962 and 1976 (IWC 1980).<br/> <br/> IWC (1996) gives a total population estimate for Sei Whales south of 30°S in summer of about 10,000 in 1983 based on a combination of International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) and Japanese Scouting Vessel (JSV) sightings data. It is difficult to know how much reliance to place on this estimate because no variance is given, but it is consistent with a severe decline. No more recent data covering a wide area are available, except for the area south of 60°S, which is outside the main range of Sei Whales. In the absence of dedicated surveys in Sei Whale habitat, and corresponding abundance estimates, it is not possible to verify whether there has been any increase in Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales since the cessation of whaling.<br/> <br/> Because of the erratic local appearance of Sei Whales, recovery is hard to detect from observations collected in limited areas. No recovery of Sei Whales in Brazilian waters has been detected since their depletion (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997, Andriolo <em>et al</em>. 2010), but Iñíguez <em>et al. </em>(2010) reported on a possible slow recovery of Sei Whales in the southwestern Atlantic based on land and aerial sightings in Argentina. <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Generation time and maximum rate of increase</strong></em><em></em><br/>The generation time for Sei Whales is estimated to be 23.3 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The three-generation time window for applying the IUCN Red List decline criterion A is 1948–2018.<br/><br/>For assessment purposes, the IWC Scientific Committee has used a natural mortality rate of about 0.06, an age at first reproduction declining with stock depletion from 12-13 years to 10-11 years, and an annual pregnancy rate increasing with stock depletion from 0.27 to 0.37-0.39 (IWC 1977, 1980, Horwood 1980). Assuming a maximum annual pregnancy rate of 0.40, a minimum age of first reproduction of 10 years, and no juvenile mortality, the maximum rate of increase is 2.7% per year. Horwood and Millward (1987) also conclude that the maximum rate of increase for Sei Whale populations is less than 3% per year. Newer data on life history parameters have been collected in the northwestern Pacific during 2004-2015 and are awaiting analysis (IWC 2017).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Population assessment</strong></em><br/>Because the available published assessments for this species are not up to date, an updated population assessment is conducted here to enable assessment of the population reduction over the period 1948-2018 relative to the Red List A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, a conventional population assessment model was used to provide an illustration of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately. Based on the above information, fitted population sizes for the aged 1+ population size were 12,000 in 1989 in the North Atlantic, 35,000 in 2011 in the North Pacific and 10,000 in 1983 in the Southern Hemsiphere.<br/><br/>The results are provided in the Supplementary Materials, which constitute an integral part of this assessment. Results indicate severe depletion from 1948 to a minimum in the 1970s, followed by gradual recovery such that the global population of mature animals in 2018 is predicted to be around 30% of the 1948 level and to be increasing.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Sei Whale is a cosmopolitan species, with a mainly offshore distribution. The species occurs in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere, but there are no confirmed records in the northern Indian Ocean (Rice 1998, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> Sei Whales migrate between tropical and subtropical latitudes in winter and temperate and subpolar latitudes in summer, staying mainly in water temperatures of 8-18°C. Their winter distribution seems to be widely dispersed and is not fully mapped (Horwood 1987, 2017). Sei Whale sightings in the tropics and subtropics can be hard to confirm due to difficulty differentiating them from Bryde’s Whales.<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution seems to be quite variable from year to year; however, Sei Whales typically occur north of an arc running from south of Nova Scotia in the west, to the northwestern British Isles and Trondheim (Norway) in the east. They occur as far north as the Davis Strait and the northern end of the Denmark Strait, and to about 70°N in the Norwegian Sea. Occasional incursions into other areas have been noted (e.g., the Gulf of Maine, Schilling <em>et al</em>. 1993). Peaks of catch rates in early and late summer suggested a northward and southward migration through the former Nova Scotia whaling ground (Mitchell 1975). Sei Whales have been scarce in Norwegian and British waters in recent years despite significant catches there in the past. Sei Whales were caught in limited numbers, mainly in late summer, off northwestern Spain (Aguilar and Sanpera 1982). There are very few records from the Mediterranean (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known, but some animals occur off the central eastern seaboard of the U.S.A., and they are occasionally seen in winter as far south as the Caribbean Sea and Cap Blanc, Mauritania (Rice 1998, Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2012). Satellite tagging has shown Sei Whale migration from the Azores to the Labrador Sea and to the Canary Islands (Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Winter catches of Sei Whales in an area north of the Cape Verde Islands by the illegal catcher boats Sierra and Tonna in the late 1970s may indicate wintering grounds there (Best 1992).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale summer distribution is mainly north of 40°N, including the offshore North Pacific, the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. They are common only in the southernmost part of the Bering Sea, and have never been recorded in Bering Strait or the Arctic seas. They do not penetrate far into the Okhotsk Sea. Although they are rare in summer south of 40°N in the offshore central and eastern North Pacific (IWC 2018a) the presence of some Sei Whales in Hawaiian waters in both summer and fall has been confirmed (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known. Surveys in February-March 1993-95 south from Japan to the Philippines, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands found no Sei Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). However, Sei Whales were caught in winter off the Ogasawara Islands during 1923-49. Although Sei and Bryde’s Whales were not routinely distinguished at the time, Omura and Fujino (1954) found that, of a sample of “Sei” Whales examined in detail, those caught during November-April were true Sei Whales whereas those caught in May were Bryde’s Whales. Sei Whales were marked around the Northern Mariana Islands and to the northeast in January-February 1972 and some of them were recaptured in summer in the northeastern and northwestern North Pacific (Masaki 1977). Sei Whales were also sighted on a January-April survey of the waters off Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 2007 (Fulling <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific during 1986-2003 showed that Sei Whales were probably rare during the months surveyed (July to November) but there were problems distinguishing them from Brydes Whales (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <em><br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em></em><em></em><br/>The summer (January–February) distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly in the zone 40–55°S in the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, and 45–60°S in the South Pacific (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), with occasional catches recorded in the high Antarctic (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Sei and Bryde's Whales were distinguished in Peruvian whaling records from 1973; after that date, Sei Whales were caught or seen on the Peruvian grounds (3°-9°S) mainly, but not exclusively, in the austral winter (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1982, 1984).<br/><br/>Sei and Brydes Whales do not seem to have been distinguished in the records of whaling stations in Chile, because only Sei Whales are featured in their catch and sighting records (Maturana 1981, Allison 2017) but Gallardo <em>et al</em>. (1983) found both Sei and Brydes Whales present in summer (February) in most of the range of Chilean whaling operations (32°–38°S). Subsequently, Sei Whales have been observed feeding off Chile (~42°S) during the summer (Galletti <em>et al</em>. 2005). This species is also regularly observed in the Magellan Strait in summer (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sei Whales are also regularly sighted in the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (South Atlantic) with peak occurrence between February and April (Frans and Augé 2016).<br/><br/>Sei Whales were also caught in the austral winter off Costinha, northeastern Brazil (7°S) during 1947-77. Sei and Brydes Whales were distinguished only from 1967; after that date, Sei Whales represented about 90% of the catch of the two species combined (Williamson 1975; da Rocha 1983).<br/><br/>The catches of ""Sei"" Whales recorded off Angola, the Congo, Gabon, and countries in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century were probably mainly Bryde's Whales (Weir 2010). Platform-of-opportunity surveys of cetaceans in these waters during 2004-09 resulted in only one Sei Whale sighting out of over 3,000 cetacean sightings, including 88 sightings of Brydes Whales (Weir 2011). Catches off western South Africa (Saldanha Bay) and eastern South Africa (Durban) peaked in spring and autumn, and are suggestive of populations on migration routes (Horwood 1987). One specimen is known from the northwest cost of Java, Indonesia (Flower 1865). The overall winter distribution in the Southern Hemisphere remains poorly known<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, but winter sightings of Sei Whales including newborns close to the Vitória-Trindade Seamount Chain in Brazil suggest that Trindade Island and Martin Vaz Archipelago may represent a wintering ground for this species (Heissler <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>","<p>Commercial hunting of Sei Whales ceased in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, but catches under Special Permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2004 at the level of 100 per year (increased to 134 per year in 2017; IWC 2018b).

This species is included in CITES Appendix I although Iceland has held a reservation against this listing since 2000. Japan has no reservation on the Appendix I listing for North Pacific Sei Whales, and the continued catches are currently the subject of a compliance investigation by the CITES Secretariat (CITES 2017b).

They are found in coniferous, mixed, and deciduous woodlands, bogs, and open mountain and tundra habitats. Wolverines have evolved to scavenge from the kills of wild ungulates abandoned by more efficient predators such as wolves and lynx (Mattisson <em>et al.</em> 2016), as well as victims of accidents and disease. However, wolverines also prey on hares, rodents and occasionally animals as large as moose given certain snow conditions. They can also prey heavily on domestic sheep and semi-domesticated reindeer. The Wolverine has vast home ranges (Persson <em>et al.</em> 2009a) and good dispersal abilities (Vangen <em>et al.</em> 2001).","The threats are similar in the two populations. Human intolerance, which is used to justify lower conservation ambition in policies, is perhaps the greatest threat facing wolverines in Europe today.<br/>&#160;<br/>Predation on reindeer (Finland, Norway and Sweden) and sheep (Norway) are the most frequent damages that cause continuing debates about wolverine conservation and need to be addressed by livestock protection schemes and compensation systems (Landa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Hobbs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Tveraa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Zabel <em>et al. </em>2014, Mattisson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). The conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer need to be seen in a wider context of the challenges facing that industry, which include density-dependent food limitation, climate change, and loss of grazing areas due to infrastructure developments.<br/><br/>An emerging threat is climate change as wolverines are dependent on good snow conditions (deep snow that lasts long into springtime) for their natal dens (Copeland <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) and for food caches.<br/><br/>Poaching is also an important cause of mortality (Persson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, 2009b, 2015).","The European wolverine population is currently divided into two populations with some dispersal between them. During the 19th century, the wolverine population decreased, but the population has increased in both abundance and distribution during the 20th century.

Scandinavian</strong><br/>The Scandinavian wolverines are found in mountainous areas along the spine of the Scandinavian peninsula. This includes extensive areas along the border between Sweden and Norway and also extends southwestwards and away from the border in the southern part of Norway. They are also expanding into boreal forest areas in the south as far as and including Dalarna and Värmland County in southern Sweden and Hedmark County in southern Norway. The main body of the population exists in the northern parts of Scandinavia, but the population is expanding southwards.

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

166609000,41544,Aotus vociferans,Least Concern,,2020,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p> The species is listed as Least Concern mainly due to its wide distribution range and presumed large populations. However, further studies are required to verify the present status of its populations throughout its entire distribution range, especially in areas where the species continues to be taken for biomedical research (Brazil-Colombia-Peru border) and for illegal pet trade (north eastern Peru), and where deforestation has increased considerably during the past 10 years (Ecuador and Peru).</p>","<p> Night monkeys typically occur in primary and secondary forests (including fragmented forest and selectively logged forest), seasonally flooded and terra firme forests, and in lowland and sub-montane forests (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Aquino and Encarnación 1994a; Defler 2004; Tirira 2007; Maldonado and Peck 2014). In Ecuador, this species occurs in humid tropical forests between 200 and 900 m asl, and in subtropical forests up to 1,550 m (Tirira 2007).  </p> <p> Night monkeys are nocturnal and they are most active at dawn and dusk. During the day <em>A. vociferans</em> groups rest within holes in trees and old palms, mainly at heights of between 10-20 m. These nests are occasionally shared with other mammals (Puertas <em>et al.</em> 1995; Tirira 2007). Their diet includes fruit, nectar and flowers, leaves, and small animal prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007).<br/> <br/> As other <em>Aotus</em> species, <em>A. vociferans</em> are socially monogamous and live in small groups of between 3 and 5 individuals, composed of an adult pair and offspring of different ages, with an average group size of 3.3 individuals (Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008; Defler 2010). Males carry infants (Rotundo <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2005). Both sexes disperse. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, 1981; Fernandez-Duque 2007). Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimated a home range size of 6.3 ha for<em> A. vociferans</em> in Yasuní National Park, and observed groups ranging over their territories only at night, and more actively under a full moon.  </p> <p> The average weight of adult <em>A. vociferans</em> individuals is of 707.5 g for males and 698 g for females (Defler 2010). Captive male <em>A. lemurinus</em> reach sexual maturity at 2 years of age, and captive female <em>A. vociferans</em> and <em>A. nancymaae</em> first breed at 3-4 years. Single offspring are the rule (Fernandez-Duque 2007).</p>","<p> The species has been reported to be widely distributed in Ecuador and Peru (Aquino and Encarnación 1994a; Tirira 2007). However, deforestation has increased in its distribution range during the last 10 years, threatening these populations (De La Torre <em>et al.</em> 2011, Llactayo<em> et al.</em> 2013).  </p> <p> The status of <em>A. vociferans</em> populations in Ecuador is unknown. However, given the actual conditions of the habitat within its distribution (large extensions of forest converted to agriculture and silvo-pasture land), it is inferred that the species has been affected (De La Torre <em>et al.</em> 2011). Furthermore, in the Napo region of Peru, deforestation along river systems is high and increasing, as is deforestation from oil exploration and exploitation, together with associated immigration.</p> <p> The long-term and systematic capture of large numbers of individuals for biomedical research in Colombia, and the release of individuals post-experimentation, are the main threats for <em>A. vociferans </em>populations in the Brazil-Colombia-Peru border. The species has not been reported in the north bank of the Amazon River in Colombia for the last seven years, where the species has been systematically taken since the early 1980’s for local malaria research (Maldonado and Peck 2014). Furthermore, Ruiz‐Garcia <em>et al.</em> (2013) and Maldonado and Peck (2014) suggested that the long term post-experimental releases of <em>A. nancymaae</em> in Colombia may have displaced wild populations of <em>A. vociferans</em> at release sites. However, long‐term population studies are required to precisely determine the current status of <em>A. vociferans</em> in the area, and to clarify the taxonomy of the genus at the Brazil-Colombia-Peru border area to allow environmental authorities to implement a management plan for local <em>A. vociferans</em> populations (Maldonado <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Ruiz-García <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>","<p> Aquino and Encarnación (1988) estimated a density of 33.0 individuals/km², and Heltne (1977) 7.9 individuals/km² in northeastern Peru. Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed population structure and densities for the genus. Maldonado and Peck (2014) reported a density of 24.9 individuals/km²&#160;in terra firme forests at the Amacayacu National Park, Colombian Amazon.</p>",Unknown,"<p> <em>Aotus vociferans</em> occurs almost exclusively to the north of the Amazon River, extending to Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. A small enclave population is found on the right bank of the Solimões River, near the lower Purus River. However, Vidal <em>et al.</em> (2013) reported a group 220 miles west of this enclave, suggesting a possible extension of the species distribution to the south of the Amazon River.  </p> <p> To the north of the Amazon River its distribution is limited by geographical barriers: to the north by the Guaviare river in Colombia, to the west by the Andean Ridge, and to the east probably by the Rio Negro in Brazil (Aquino and Encarnación 1988, 1994; Defler 2010; Groves 2005; Hernandez-Camacho and Cooper 1976).&#160;&#160; </p>","<p> <em>Aotus vociferans</em> individuals are taken to be used in biomedical research in Colombia (Maldonado <em>et al.</em> 2009; Maldonado and Peck 2014). In 2015, the environmental authority Corpoamazonia authorised the capture of 1463 animals during a period of 566 days for malaria research. However, there is no information on the status of the local population to properly determine extraction quotas (Corpoamazonia 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p> The species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.</p> <p> The species is classified as Near Threatened (NT) in the Red Book of Mammals of Ecuador (De La Torre <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p> <p> The species is confirmed, or may occur, in a number of protected areas:<br/> <br/> Colombia<br/> Amacayacu Natural National Park (293,000 ha) ( Defler 2004, Maldonado and Peck, 2014) <br/> Cahuinari Natural National Park (575,500 ha) (in range, Defler 2004) <br/> Serrania de Chiribiquete Natural National Park (1,280,000 ha) (in range, Defler 2004) <br/> Cordillera de los Picachos Natural National Park (286,600 ha) (in range, Defler 2004)<br/> La Paya Natural National Park (442,000 ha) (Polanco-Ochoa <em>et al.</em> 1999)<br/> Nukak Natural National Reserve (855,000 ha) (in range, Defler 2004)<br/> Puinawai Natural National Reserve (1,092,500 ha) (in range, Defler 2004)<br/> <br/> Ecuador <br/> Yasuní National Park (982,000 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/> Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park (205,249 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/> Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserve (403,000 ha) (in range) (Tirira 2007)<br/> Limoncocha Biological Reserve (4,613 ha) (in range) (Tirira 2007)<br/> Cuyabeno Faunistic Reserve (603,380 ha) (in range) (Tirira 2007)<br/> Cóndor National Park (2,440 ha) (Tirira 2007)</p> <p> <br/> Brazil<br/> Jaú National Park (2,378,410 ha)<br/> Juamí-Japurá Ecological Station (832,078 ha)<br/> Mamirauá State Sustainable Development Reserve (1,124,000 ha)<br/> Amanã State Sustainable Development Reserve (2,350,000 ha)<br/> <br/> Peru<br/> Reserva Nacional Pucacuro (637,954 ha)</p> <p> Parque Nacional Güeppí-Sekime (203,628 ha)</p> <p> <br/> Given the increasing threats faced by<em> </em><em>A. vociferans</em> and the lack of information on the present status of its populations, it is recommended that:</p> <ul> 	<li> <p>Population 	density estimations are undertaken in protected areas and areas 	where the species is most vulnerable (see Threats).</p> 	</li><li> <p>The 	effects of long-term extraction and post-experimental release of 	individuals on local populations are evaluated (see Threats).</p> 	</li><li> <p>The 	subspecies’ resilience to human impact, deforestation and hunting 	pressure is evaluated.</p> 	</li><li> <p> 	Suitable 	practices of landscape management are developed that contribute to 	the sustainable use of resources, minimizing the impact on primate 	populations and habitat.  	</p> 	</li><li> <p> 	National 	campaigns to prevent illegal trade are instigated.</p> </li></ul> <p> <br/> <br/>  </p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
