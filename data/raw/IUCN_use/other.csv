2773889,20731,Stenella coeruleoalba,Vulnerable,A2bcde,2012,2010-08-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This subpopulation of Striped Dolphin has been, and is currently, subject to a number of threats that, cumulatively, reduced its size and may still be slowing its recovery. An abrupt reduction in population size occurred in 1990–1992 due to a die-off involving many 1,000s of deaths (Bortolotto <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993). Immediately after this die-off, the mean school size was found to be less than one third of prior levels, which implied a proportional reduction in overall population size (Forcada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994). In 2001–2003, the density (0.49 dolphin/km²) of Striped Dolphins estimated in the Gulf of Valencia was again close to the maximum reported for this species in the western Mediterranean (Gómez de Segura <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>., 2006). No similar information is available from other areas. In a 17-year study of variability in group size, Gaspari <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (in prep.) have found a gradual increase over time in the Ligurian  Sea.<br/></p>  <p>The primary cause of the die-off was a morbillivirus infection (Domingo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1990). PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with potential for immunosuppressive effects were suggested to have enhanced its lethality (Aguilar and Borrell 1994). In 2006–2007 another morbillivirus outbreak affected the species off the coasts of Spain (Fernández <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Raga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008) and later extended to France and the Italian Ligurian Sea (Garibaldi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). The mortality associated with that event seemed more moderate (though at least 200 carcasses were reported in Spain), probably because part of the adult population still preserved antibodies against morbillivirus (Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Raga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). The reduction of the organochlorine load in the population resulting from a general decline in pollutant levels in the Mediterranean (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) may also have implied a reduction in mortality (Castrillon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press).<br/></p>  <p>Besides their immunosuppressive action, PCBs and other organochlorines impair reproduction through a variety of mechanisms. Past and current levels much exceed thresholds from which reproductive effects have been observed in Bottlenose and other dolphins. PCBs may have played a role in the occurrence of luteinized cysts in the ovaries of four of 56 (7.1%) Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Munson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998) although there is no evidence that these cysts have impaired reproduction to such an extent that it would affect the overall population. <br/></p>  <p>Incidental capture in fishing gear, particularly in pelagic driftnets, has been high in at least the last two decades, causing thousands of deaths per year (Silvani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Imbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Tudela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Finally, given the overexploited state of most fishing resources in the Mediterranean, decreased food availability caused by fishing may be an added limitation on the recovery&#160; of the Striped Dolphin population, although the significance of such a potential threat has not been assessed.</p>It is suspected that a reduction in population size of &gt;30% occurred over the last three generations (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">ca</span>. 60 years) (Criterion A2) based on the  2/3 reduction in mean school size in the 1990s (here considered an index of abundance) (A2b), a decline in quality of habitat, particularly food availability (A2c), past and current high levels of exploitation in the form of incidental mortality in fisheries (A2d), and the effects of pathogens and pollutants (A2e). <br/>  <p>The causes of the population reduction may be reversible but are neither clearly reversible nor understood; moreover, none of the threats (i.e. potential or likely causes of the decline) has ceased except for pollution by organochlorine pollutants, which has declined in the last two decades (Aguilar and Borrell 2005). Reducing the health threats still caused by PCBs and others pollutants such as brominated flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and perfluorinated compounds may require that these pollutants decrease to a non-effect threshold. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The Striped Dolphin is an oceanic species. It shows a preference for highly productive, open waters beyond the continental shelf. It is particularly abundant in the Ligurian Sea, the Gulf of Lions, the waters between the Balearic Islands and the Iberian Peninsula, and the Alborán Sea. In the Ligurian Sea, this species showed no preference for any specific physiographic features, but was almost homogeneously distributed (Azzellino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Life History Parameters</span><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Age at maturity</span>:<br/>Females: 12 years (western Mediterranean population) (Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996)<br/>Males: 11.3 years (western Mediterranean population) (Calzada 1996)<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Longevity</span>:<br/>Females: 32 years (Di Mèglio and Romero-Álvarez 1996, Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997)<br/>Males: 28 years (Di Mèglio and Romero-Álvarez 1996, Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997)<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Percentage of living population that is reproductively mature</span>:<br/>Unknown<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Average age of parents in the population</span>:<br/>Females: 22 years (Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997)<br/>Males: 20 years (Calzada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996)<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gestation time</span>:<br/>Slightly over 12 months (Aguilar 1991)<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Average interbirth interval</span>:<br/>2.7 years (in Japan) (Kasuya 1985)<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maximum potential annual rate of population increase</span>:<br/>0.09 (Schmitz and Lavigne 1984)","<p>In 1990–1992 a die-off devastated much of, if not the entire, Mediterranean population;  1,000 carcasses were examined in Spain, Italy and France alone, but the toll was undoubtedly much higher because these countries represent only a fraction of the Mediterranean coastline known to have been affected by the process (Bortolotto<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993). Immediately after the event, the mean school size was found to be less than one third of original levels, which may be taken as an indication, but not as a proof, for a proportional reduction in overall population size (Forcada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1994). The primary cause of the die-off was a morbillivirus infection (Domingo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1990, Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1993). The epidemic started in regions containing unusually large numbers of inbred dolphins that were possibly more susceptible to diseases (Valsecchi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with potential for causing immunosuppressive effects were suggested to have enhanced its lethality because the individuals that succumbed to the disease were those carrying the highest PCB tissue concentrations (Aguilar and Borrell 1994). </p>  <p>A second outbreak occurred in 2006–2007 affecting the coasts of Spain (Fernández <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Raga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008), France and the Italian Ligurian Sea (Garibaldi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). The mortality associated with that event was moderate, with only about 200 carcasses reported, probably because older dolphins were still protected by the immunity developed during the 1990–1992 epidemic (Raga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Moreover, differently to the previous outbreak, PCB levels in the individuals that succumbed to this event were not significantly different from those in the surviving population, which suggests that pollutants were of no relevance to the 2006–2007 event (Castrillon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Recurrent epidemics may have profound cumulative effects on the population dynamics of Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009a).<br/></p>  <p>Poxviruses with the potential to cause mortality of neonates and young calves are also circulating in this population (Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009b). Marine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">brucellae</span> also infect Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). These bacteria may limit recruitment by compromising the normal functioning of male and female reproductive systems, inducing abortions and killing neonates and sexually mature individuals (Van Bressem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a). Finally, infection by the protozoan<em> Toxoplasma gondii </em>seems to be common in Mediterranean striped dolphins (Domingo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1992, Cabezon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004) and has been suggested as another factor contributing to the death toll during morbillivirus epidemics.<br/></p>  <p>Tissue levels of organochlorine compounds, some heavy metals, selenium and possibly other pollutants such as the brominated flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and perfluorinated compounds are high and often exceed threshold levels above which detrimental effects commonly appear in mammals (Aguilar 2000, Marsili <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kannan <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pettersson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Blubber concentrations of DDT and PCB, the two main organochlorine pollutants, show a slowly declining trend in the last two decades (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) but are currently still high. Besides the alleged immunodepressive effect (see above), high PCB levels may have been implicated in the development of unusual luteinized cysts in the ovaries of four of 56 (7.1%) Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Munson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1988), although other factors like the morbillivirus infection, stress and food depletion could have contributed to the abnormal surge or release of luteinizing hormone. <br/></p>  The Spanish driftnet fishery in the Alboran Sea reportedly killed 148–170 dolphins per season in the early 1990s (Silvani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999); this fishery was halted in 1995 but the nets were transferred to Moroccan boats, which continue operating and are estimated to kill in the order of 1,500–2,000 Striped Dolphins per year (Tudela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). The Italian driftnet fishery (<em>spadare </em>fishery) has been claimed to kill 5,000–15,000 dolphins, mostly Striped Dolphins, per year (Di Natale 1992); although fishing effort is declining, current catch levels are thought to be still high. The French <em>thonaille </em>driftnet fishery has been estimated to kill 180–472 Striped Dolphins per season (Imbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001). Reports from other fisheries are sparse and bycatch data are not collected systematically, but what evidence there is suggests that incidental catches of Striped Dolphins are widespread and likely to represent a significant toll at least in pelagic purse-seines, drifting long-lines and gill nets (Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994). To this should be added a certain number of direct catches for human consumption or for use as bait, which still continue in several Mediterranean countries (SGFEN 2001).    <p>The diet of Striped Dolphins includes commercial fish and cephalopod species (Pulcini <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1992, Blanco <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995), so the widespread depletion of fishery resources in the Mediterranean has the potential to affect Striped Dolphin numbers.</p>Global warming may have significant direct and indirect effects on cetacean populations in the Mediterranean (Gambaiani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Climate variability and change affect biomass in a number of ways, including shifts in species distribution. Azzellino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008b) showed a direct effect of sea surface temperature on striped dolphin distribution in the Ligurian Sea.","<p>  </p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population structure</span><br/>Morphological and genetic studies strongly suggest that the Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic populations are genetically differentiated, with little or no gene flow across the Straits of Gibraltar. Maximum body length of eastern North Atlantic striped dolphins is 5-8 cm longer than that of Mediterranean individuals (Calzada and Aguilar 1995). Skull size is also smaller in Mediterranean specimens than in their neighbouring Atlantic counterparts (Archer 1997). Mitochondrial DNA analysis, from Gibraltar to Greece, yielded 59 haplotypes (n=166), none of which was shared between the two areas, thus supporting strong differentiation; analyses of nuclear DNA support this result (Gaspari <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Gaspari <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in prep).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Subpopulation structure </span><br/>Genetic analyses of Striped Dolphins from Gibraltar to the coast of Israel, both at nuclear and mitochondrial levels, show that this species is genetically structured within the Mediterranean with low gene flow across the basin. Furthermore, there is evidence for sex-biased dispersal (Gaspari <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in prep). On a smaller geographic level, Gaspari (2004) found evidence of genetic differentiation between inshore and offshore populations in the Ligurian Sea. Moreover, inside the Mediterranean there is some clinal variation in body size suggestive of population structure and/or restriction in gene flow between areas (Calzada and Aguilar 1995). This appears to be confirmed by significant differences in tissue pollutant levels between Spain and Italy (Monaci <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Range and population</span><br/>Although overall the Striped Dolphin is the most abundant cetacean in the Mediterranean, both in the eastern and the western basins, it is not found at uniform densities. It typically shows a preference for highly productive, open waters beyond the continental shelf (Notarbartolo di Sciara <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1993, Forcada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Frantzis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Gannier 2005). A small number of Striped Dolphins may be resident in the eastern portion of the Gulf of Corinth (Greece) (Frantzis and Herzing 2002). Two strandings were recorded in the Marmara Sea in 1990s (Öztürk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999).<br/><br/>Reliable abundance estimates are only available for the western basin and most of them refer to the period immediately or soon after the 1990–1992 die-off. There is no available estimate for the eastern Mediterranean Sea:<br/><ul><li>Western Mediterranean excluding the Tyrrhenian Sea (1991): 117,880&#160; [95% CI = 68,379–214,800] (Forcada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994).</li><li>Balearic Sea (1991): 5,826 [95% CI = 2,193–15,476] (Forcada and Hammond 1998).</li><li>Gulf of Lions (1991): 30,774 [95% CI = 17,433-54,323] (Forcada and Hammond 1998).</li><li>Ligurian Sea (1992): 14,003 [95% CI = 6,305–31,101] (Forcada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995).</li><li>South Balearic area (1991): 18,810 [95% CI = 8,825–35,940] (Forcada and Hammond 1998).</li><li>Alboran Sea (1991): 17,728 [95% CI = 9,507–33,059] (Forcada and Hammond 1998).</li><li>Central coast of Spain (2000–2002): 15,778 [95% CI = 10,940–22,756] (Gómez de Segura <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).</li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population trend</span><br/>the population declined in the early 1990s.

Development of offshore protected areas through international agreements similar to the case in the Ligurian sea should be encouraged.

Population trend data for this species are unavailable. A primary threat that could cause widespread declines is vulnerability to high-level anthropogenic sound sources, especially military sonar and seismic surveys. Although the current population remains depleted from whaling the decline took place more than three generation lengths ago.<br/><br/>The combination of possible declines driven by vulnerability to high-level anthropogenic sound sources and bycatch is believed sufficient that a 30% reduction over three generations (in this case 54 years) could not be ruled out.  Therefore, the species is currently considered to be Data Deficient.","The behavior and ecology of northern bottlenose whales have been better studied than that of any other species in the family Ziphiidae.  Most groups contain at least four whales, sometimes with as many as 20, and there is some segregation by age and sex. These deep divers can remain submerged for an hour, possibly as long as two, and can reach depths of well over 1,400 m (Hooker and Baird 1999). They are known for their curiosity, often approaching and swimming around boats for some time, as well as their habit of ""standing by"" injured companions; these behaviours permitted whalers to kill large numbers of whales at the same site (Gray 1882). Although capable of travelling long distances, their movement patterns are generally quite localized (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2002, Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/>These cold temperate to subarctic whales are found in deep waters, mostly seaward of the continental shelf (and generally over 500-1,000 m deep) and near submarine canyons.  They sometimes travel several kilometres into broken ice fields, but are more common in open water.  Few whales were caught in shallow waters over the continental shelf off Labrador and in waters less than 1000 m deep off the west coast of Norway. In the surrounding waters of Iceland, the whales were sighted in waters with surface temperature between -1.3°C and +0.9°C (Reyes 1991).<br/><br/>Northern bottlenose whales occupy a very narrow niche; their primary food source is squid of the genus <em>Gonatus</em> (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2001, Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 2003) These whales may also occasionally eat fish (such as herring and redfish), sea cucumbers, starfish, and prawns. They do much of their feeding on or near the bottom in very deep water (&gt;800 m, and as deep as 1,400 m: Hooker and Baird 1999). Longevity is at least 37 years, possibly much longer (Christensen 1973).","This is one of only a few species of beaked whales to be hunted commercially on a large scale. Hunts occurred from the 1850s to the 1970s, and over 65,000 whales were killed (with many more struck but lost: Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1993). By far the major bottlenose whaling nation has been Norway, though some hunting was also done by the UK and Canada. The northern bottlenose was sought after for its oil (including a form of spermaceti oil in the head) and later for pet food. No hunting of this species has been conducted by Norway since 1973 (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 1993, Reyes 1991). The species has been essentially unexploited for almost 30 years, with only a few animals taken in some years in the Faroe Islands. The aggregate population was certainly reduced by whaling, and the extent of recovery is uncertain (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003).  Mitchell (1977) considered that the population was severely depleted in both the early and modern whaling periods. Very few incidental catches have been reported (Reyes 1991). <br/><br/>Pollutant levels in this species are usually low (Reyes 1991). There are no major fisheries for squid in the Northeast Atlantic, but future developments could represent some threat for subpopulations as heavily depleted as those of the bottlenose whale (Culik 2004). This species, like other beaked whales, is likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006).","Global numbers of northern bottlenose whales are largely unknown. There are estimated to be more than 5,000 in the waters around Iceland and the Faroe Islands. An estimated 40,000 occur in the eastern North Atlantic (NAMMCO Annual Report 1995), including approximately 5,827 (CV=16%) in the high latitudes of the eastern North Atlantic (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990). Estimates for Icelandic and Faroese waters are 3,142 and 287 whales respectively, although allowance was not made in the surveys for animals not observed because of their long dives (Reyes 1991). Most populations of the species are probably still depleted, due to large kills in the past; over 65,000 animals were killed in a multinations hunt that operated in the North Atlantic from c.1850 to the early 1970s (Mitchell 1977, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1993). A study by Christensen and Ugland (1983) resulted in an estimated initial (pre-whaling) population size of about 90,000 whales, reduced to some 30,000 by 1914. The population size by the mid 1980s was said to be about 54,000, nearly 60% of the initial stock size.",Unknown,"Northern bottlenose whales are found only in the North Atlantic, from New England, USA to Baffin Island and southern Greenland in the west and from the Strait of Gibraltar to Svalbard in the east (c. 38ºN to 72ºN: Mead 1989, Gowans 2002).  There are reports from the Mediterranean Sea, and some extralimital records from the Baltic Sea. Bottlenose whales are occasionally observed off the Azores (Steiner <em>et al.</em> 1998), and have been seen as far south as the Cape Verde Islands (15ºN: Ruud 1937). The pelagic distribution extends from the ice edges south to approximately 30°N. Historic catch distributions indicated the existence of at least six centres of abundance, each potentially representing a separate stock (Benjaminsen 1972): i) the Gully; ii) northern Labrador-Davis Strait; iii) northern Iceland; iv) and v), off Andenes and Møre, Norway, and vi) around Svalbard, Spitzbergen. Anecdotal reports from whalers suggest a north/south seasonal migration could occur in some regions but there is little strong evidence for this. They inhabit the most northerly waters of the Barents and Greenland seas in summer (May to August). The northern bottlenose whale forms an antitropical species pair with the southern bottlenose whale, <em>Hyperoodon planifrons</em>.","This species was heavily exploited in the past for multiple purposes, but there is now only a very small-scale fishery in the Faroes. For further details, see threats section.",Marine,"The northern bottlenose whale is said to have been twice overexploited by Norwegian hunting, in the periods 1880-1920 and 1938-1973. It was included in the International Whaling Commission schedule in 1977, with recommendations that northern bottlenose whales be granted Protected Stock status with zero catch limit (Klinowska 1991). It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species as well as in Appendix I of CITES. Populations or stocks are not defined; this, together with estimates of present abundance as well as present levels of catches (Faroe Islands), should be the focus of future studies (Reyes 1991, Culik 2004, Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2006).","",,false,false,Europe

In the Mediterranean there have been population declines, and the regional population was recently assessed as Vulnerable (A4de)(Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). However in the eastern North Atlantic there are large populations that show no evidence of significant decline, although population trends have not been quantified. Overall in the European Mammal Assessment region, it is not possible to quantify the population trend because the relative size of the different subpopulations is not known. Consequently the species is assessed as Data Deficient at the European regional level.","Striped dolphins are primarily found in warm temperate and tropical oceanic regions and are seen close to shore only where deep water approaches the coast (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1999). In the Strait of Gibraltar, they are found in waters of 600 m or more depth (Hashmi 1990).  In the Mediterranean, striped dolphins are associated with highly productive, oceanic waters beyond the continental shelf (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 1993, Forcada <em>et al.</em> 1994, Frantzis <em>et al.</em> 2003, Gannier 2005). <br/><br/>The diet of striped dolphins consists primarily of a wide variety of small, midwater and pelagic or benthopelagic fish, especially lanternfish, cod, and squids (Wurtz and Marrale 1993, Hassani <em>et al.</em> 1997, Archer 2002). Striped dolphins apparently feed in pelagic to benthopelagic zones, to depths as deep as 200-700m, in continental slope or oceanic regions.","In the Mediterranean small numbers were taken in Spain, France and Italy for human consumption. They were also hunted for use as bait for shrimp traps and longlines. Despite being illegal, catches continue in southern Spain and probably in other areas (SGFEN 2001, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). In the Northeast Atlantic, striped dolphins were harpooned to supply food for consumption on board or to scare them away from tuna trolling lines.  It is difficult to ascertain the number of dolphins taken in this way, but it has been estimated in the thousands (Reyes 1991).<br/><br/>Incidental catches occur throughout the range in various types of fishing gear, especially purse seines and gillnets. The high-seas drift gillnet fisheries, which operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about  35°N and 47°N, increased during the 1970s, and peaked during the 1980s before a United Nations moratorium went into effect in January 1993.  Bycatch estimates are only available for 1990, when about 3,000 striped dolphins were estimated killed (Hobbs and Jones 1993).  During the 1970s and 1980s, the combined high-seas driftnet fisheries likely killed tens of thousands of striped dolphins, but this level would not have been high enough to cause population declines (Hobbs and Jones 1993).<br/><br/>Incidental captures in pelagic driftnets have been a major source of mortality all over the western Mediterranean in the past. These nets are still being illegally used, e.g. by Moroccan, French, Italian and Turkish vessels, resulting in extensive dolphin mortality. The Spanish driftnet fishery in the Alborán Sea reportedly killed 145-183 striped dolphins per season in the early 1990s (Silvani <em>et al.</em> 1999); this fishery was halted in 1995 but the nets were transferred to Moroccan boats, which continue operating and are estimated to kill in the order of 1,555-2,092 striped dolphins per year (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2005). The Italian driftnet fishery has been reported to kill 5,000-15,000 dolphins, mostly striped dolphins, per year (Di Natale 1992). The French thonaille driftnet fishery has been estimated to take about 180-472 striped dolphins per season (Imbert <em>et al.</em> 2001). Reports from other fishing activities are sparse and collected non-systematically, but they indicate that striped dolphin mortality in at least pelagic purse-seines, longlines and gillnets is widespread and likely significant (Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994). <br/><br/>Large incidental kills in pelagic trawl and driftnet fisheries off western Europe are also a source of concern (IWC 1998, Tregenza and Collet 1998). Antoine <em>et al.</em> (2001) found that by-catch rates in the tuna drift-net fishery in the northeastern Atlantic were 90% composed of <em>Delphinus delphis</em> and <em>Stenella coeruleoalba</em>. Mean catch rate by trip in 1992-1993 years were 4.7 striped dolphins per km of net and per day. Such rates are similar to those estimated in other driftnet fisheries. Goujon (1996) estimated the annual additional mortality linked to driftnets in the Bay of Biscay albacore tuna fishery to 1.8% for the striped dolphin (this estimate must be increased by 30% in order to take into account the whole European albacore tuna driftnet fishery). <br/><br/>Tissue levels of organochlorine compounds, some heavy metals and selenium in Mediterranean striped dolphins are high and exceed threshold levels above which detrimental effects commonly appear in mammals (Monaci <em>et al.</em> 1998, Aguilar 2000, Cardellicchio <em>et al.</em> 2000). Organochlorine pollutants, in particular, are found at levels that greatly exceed thresholds of reproductive impairment in bottlenose dolphins elsewhere (Aguilar 2006). Blubber concentrations of DDT (an agricultural pesticide) and PCB, the two main organochlorine pollutants, have been slowly declining in the last two decades (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) but are still high. High PCB levels have the potential to depress reproductive rates in striped dolphins (Munson<em> et al.</em> 1988).<br/><br/>The 1990-92 epizootic devastated the whole Mediterranean population of striped dolphins, producing many thousands of deaths (Bortolotto <em>et al.</em> 1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993). Immediately after the event, the mean school size was found to be less than one third of prior levels, which may be interpreted as indicating a proportional reduction in overall population size (Forcada <em>et al.</em> 1994).  The primary cause of the die-off was a morbillivirus infection (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 1990) but PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with potential for immunosuppressive effects may have triggered the event or enhanced its spread and lethality (Aguilar and Borrell 1994). <br/><br/>Commercially exploited fish and cephalopod species are important components of striped dolphin diet in the Mediterranean (Blanco <em>et al.</em> 1995). As many stocks of important striped dolphin prey (e.g. the European anchovy) are known to have been depleted, reduced prey availability resulting from conflict with commercial fisheries is considered a potentially important threat (Reyes 1991, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006) and may have contributed to the 1990-1992 epizootic (Aguilar 2000).","Striped dolphins are the most abundant cetacean species in the Mediterranean. The population in the western Mediterranean excluding the Tyrrhenian Sea was estimated in 1991 to be 117,880 dolphins (95%CI=68,379-214,800) (Forcada <em>et al.</em> 1994). There is no estimate for the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Goujon (1996) conducted a sighting survey in 1993 in the fishing grounds of the albacore tuna driftnet fishery in the Bay of Biscay and estimated the abundance of striped dolphins as 74,000 individuals.  <br/><br/>Morphological and genetic studies strongly suggest that the Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic populations are isolated from each other, with little or no gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar (Calzada and Aguilar 1995, García-Martínez <em>et al.</em> 1995, Archer 1997,  Gaspari 2004). Within the Mediterranean there is some evidence of population structure based on restriction in gene flow between areas and significant differences in tissue pollutant levels (Calzada and Aguilar 1995, Monaci <em>et al.</em> 1998, Gaspari 2004).",Unknown,"This is a widely-distributed species, found tropical and warm-temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as well as many adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean. Northern and southern range limits are about 50°N and 40°S, although there are extra-limital records from the Kamchatka Peninsula, southern Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Prince Edward Islands.

They are often found in successional or forest-edge habitats, in scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks that have high densities of small mammals, especially <i>Microtus</i> and <i>Arvicola</i> species (King, 1983). Pulliainen (1999) states that coniferous and mixed woodlands are preferred, but that many other habitats are used including tundra and the summits of fells and mountains. Dense forests and deserts are avoided (King, 1983). Specifically to Mongolia, they inhabit taiga, forest-steppe and rocky parts of the semi-desert. This species is a specialist predator of small mammals, but will occasionally feed on fruit, earthworms, insects, eggs, and birds (King, 1983). Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King, 1983; Pulliainen, 1999). This species is nocturnal but are often seen in daylight hours. Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 hectares for males, most often falling between 10 to 40 hectares (King, 1983).<br><br>Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King, 1983).

Locally the species may be threatened by unrestricted trapping and habitat loss due to timber harvest or natural disturbance (Fagerstone 1987). In the Iberian Peninsula the species is dependent on two <i>Arvicola</i> species, and these are declining, so loss of prey base may be a threat (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). Habitat loss (e.g. as a result of urbanization: Pulliainen, 1999) is also a problem in parts of the range. The species is commonly hunted in Russia, where there is also a limited fur trade (McDonald pers. comm.). In western and central Europe, the stoat was frequently hunted for its white winter fur up until at least the 1930s, with c.30,000 pelts sold in Finland alone during that decade (Pulliainen, 1999). Availability of prey is the principal factor controlling population density (King, 1983; Pulliainen, 1999), but disease, parasites and other pressures can also contribute.","Total adult population size is unknown but certainly exceeds 100,000. The density and structure of populations of this species are unstable, due to short life spans and high reproductive capacity. Populations are greatly influenced by fluctuations in prey supply (especially small mammals) (King, 1983; Pulliainen, 1999). Population fluctuations of stoats and their prey tend to increase in magnitude at more northerly latitudes (Pulliainen, 1999), although fluctuations have also been recorded in Spain (Blanco, 1998; Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). In France, it was declining, but now has stabilized as a result of full protection. In Spain it has been speculated that the population may be declining as a results of declines in the southern water vole, <i>Arvicola sapidus</i>, (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002), but the population trend has not been quantified in Spain or Portugal (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002; Cabral <i>et al.</i>, 2005). It is abundant in north-western and central Mongolia, but is rare in the eastern plains (Bannikov, 1954; Dulamtseren, 1970; Sokolov and Orlov, 1980). Despite population fluctuations, it is a widespread and abundant species, common in suitable habitats. However, in some parts of its range it is rare.",Stable,"Circumboreal range throughout North America, Europe, and Asia, from Greenland and the Canadian and Siberian Arctic islands south to about 35°N (King 1983, Fagerstone 1987).

However, it is probably declining due to over-hunting, like <em>Capricornis milneedwardsi</em>, and so it is listed as Near Threatened because this species is believed to be in significant decline (but probably at a rate of less than 30% over three generations, taken at 21 years, making the species close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion A). This Red List assessment is based on the best available information, but contains considerable uncertainty. The true status of the species may be better or worse than this. Future revisions of this classification may reflect true changes in status, or may simply reflect better information.","There is nothing known about the natural history of this species. It is assumed to  be similar in ecology to <em>Capricornis milneedwardsii</em>, inhabiting rugged steep hills and rocky places, as well as hill and mountain forest areas with gentler terrain.","The threats to this species are not known, but there is significant hunting of other large mammals in the area. The serow in Myanmar is one of the most heavily traded species in the local trade.  Every market surveyed by TRAFFIC in Myanmar in 2006 had Serow, and in most markets, this was the most commonly observed species, with the bulk of the parts observed being horns and heads. Many of these markets are situated on the Myanmar-Thailand border and dealers claim that all buyers in these border markets come from Thailand, indicating a blatant disregard for both national legislation and CITES. Serows are protected throughout Southeast Asia by law, but protecting this species on the ground does not appear to be a priority in many countries.<br/><br/>Serow are very heavily hunted in Myanmar, with meat usually being consumed locally, but parts, including the forelegs, heads, horns and fat from the stomach region being the most sought after for use in traditional medicines.  These parts are rendered down and the oil is sold in small bottles.  According to dealers, this oil is applied externally to treat skin ailments and joint problems.  Horn tips are also exported from Myanmar to Thailand to be attached to the spurs of fighting cocks (this is believed to give them more power).<br/><br/>In 2006, interviews with dealers in border markets and markets in the centre of Myanmar, revealed that in all areas surveyed, Serow are apparently in decline. Hunters stated that they were having to travel further to get serow, and that they were, in many locations, becoming scarce.",There is no current information on the population of this species.,Decreasing,"This species is known from northern, and perhaps western, Myanmar (Grubb, 2005). The range of <em>C. rubidus</em> is not well known, partly because of confusion with another red serow form in adjacent territories to the west in Assam and Bangladesh, and the fact that all serows can show varying amounts of red and black colouration. True <em>rubidus</em> specimens have black hair base rather than white. Records and specimens from Kachin state in the north of Myanmar are clearly this species. Other localities reported include the Upper Chindwin, Ararakan Hill Tracts and limestone hills in the upper Salween. Without accompanying specimens these records are less certain. The species may overlap in some locations with <em>C. milneedwardsii</em> which extends through most of the Shan States and Pegu (Bago) Yoma at least as far west as the Ayeyarwady river.

Females are slightly smaller at 1.79 m, weighing 120 kg. Females in the northwest Atlantic mature at about 4-5 years, compared to males at 5-8 years. The Jan Mayen and White Sea breeding groups reach maturity about a year earlier (Ronald and Healey 1981). The maximum life span of a harp seal is approximately 30 years, and it is not unusual for them to reach over 20 years of age. Both males and females are sexually active until their 20s, and females may give birth every year until they are at least 16 years old (Ronald and Healey 1981).<br/><br/>Harp seals are migratory, and after breeding, Canadian seals follow the pack ice up the coast of Labrador, with small numbers into Hudson Bay, to Baffin Island, and both sides of the Davis Strait, to Greenland. The Jan Mayen and White Sea groups migrate and mix in the Barents Sea. The Jan Mayen group reaches the high Arctic, up to 85 degrees north.<br/><br/>Harp seals consume a wide range of prey that varies along the migration route. Their diet, according to Lavigne (2002), consists of 67 species of fish and 70 species of invertebrates. Pups and juveniles take euphausiids (<em>Thyanoessa</em> spp.) and amphipods (<em>Parathemisto</em> spp.) (Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2001), whereas adults take pelagic crustaceans and a variety of fish (Kapel 2000).","Harp seals have been harvested for thousands of years by native peoples of the Atlantic Arctic, including coastal Northern Europeans (Stora and Ericson 2004).  Basque whalers began taking harp seals in the 1500s.  By the mid-1600s, French settlers began the hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, developing land-based netting techniques on the St. Lawrence River in the 1700s.  The French Canadians exported 500 tons of oil per year by the mid-1700s, based on an estimated take of 6,000 seals per year. In Newfoundland, English settlers hunted harp seals on a larger scale that accounted for an estimated 7,000-12,800 seals per year for most of the 1700s, including 50,000 whitecoats (juvenile harp seals) killed in 1773.  By the 1800s, schooner-based sealing developed, and the number of seals harvested rose dramatically; from 1803-1816 the average annual was 117,000.  The peak of sealing in the northwest Atlantic occurred between 1818 and 1862, when 500,000 seals were harvested in many years, reaching a maximum of 640,000-740,000 in single years.  During that time, it is estimated that 18.3 million harp seals, mostly whitecoats, were killed for oil.  The records show somewhat lower figures for the northeast Atlantic. At Jan Mayen, the catch began falling in the late 1850s, attributed to overhavesting.  From 1860 to 1900, an estimated 12.8 million seals were harvested there (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).  <br/> <br/>The 20th century saw the advent of steel-hulled ships, and the hunt continued, though harp seals became more valued for their pelts than their oil.  143,000 seals were taken in 1917. This number fell during the war years, then rose again in the 1950s, when it averaged 312,000 seals per year. In 1960, Canada became concerned about the large numbers of adults being killed, so it placed limits on the length of the hunting season.  During the 1960s, an average of 284,000 seals were taken per year.  In 1964 observers sent by humane organizations described the clubbing of whitecoats, and the subsequent public outcry led to seal protection regulations controlling the methods of the kill, and the types of vessels used. Adult females were protected on the breeding grounds, and Norway was excluded from sealing in Canadian waters. In 1971 a quota management program was set up, and from 1970 to 1987 the quotas varied, from 127,000 per year to 245,000 per year, but the actual harvest was often much lower (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).<br/><br/>In 1983, the European Economic Community imposed an import ban on all whitecoat (juvenile harp seal) products, and the average annual harvest in Canadian waters fell to 52,000 seals from 1983-1995. By 1987, Canada outlawed the killing of whitecoats, and the focus of the hunted switched to beaters (post-weaning to 13 months of age) (Anon. 2006a). From 1999-2003, the estimated annual mortality of harp seals in the northwest Atlantic was 453,962, broken down into an average of 232,915 taken in the commercial harvest by Canada, 83,010 taken from 1999-2002 in Greenland, and 4,881 taken in the Canadian high Arctic, plus a bycatch of 18,566 in the Newfoundland lumpfish fishery, with an average annual struck and loss rate of 119,430 from all harvests  (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2005). <br/><br/>Since the late 1970s large numbers of harp seals have been leaving the Barents Sea, and possibly the Greenland Sea, to forage along the coast of Norway, resulting in the deaths of thousands of seals in shore-based net fisheries.  Bycatch mortality from nets was estimated to be 56,647 (perhaps up to 100,000) in 1987, and 21,474 in 1988 (Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991, Woodley and Lavigne 1991). <br/><br/>Another threat to harp seals is the overharvesting of their prey, including herring and capelin. There have also been calls for an increased cull of harp seals to protect the  Atlantic cod fishery, for some years in a steep decline  (Lavigne 2002).<br/>  <br/>Oil spills in the northwest Atlantic off the east coast of Canada remain a threat to seals. There is a concern about the impacts of tanker traffic, particularly in places like Lancaster Sound in the eastern Canadian Arctic, which is an important harp seal summering area (Reijinders <em>et al.</em> 1993). Additionally, harp seals have been found to carry significant loads of contaminants including heavy metals, organochlorines and PCBs (Ronald <em>et al.</em> 1984a,b).  <br/><br/>Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was first found in harp seals from the West Ice off Jan Mayen in 1987 and 1989.  It is widespread in harp seals, but it is not known if there are significant health effects or mortality from the infection. The harp seals may have been carriers infecting harbor seals, which did experience a mass mortality in Europe in 1988 (Markussen and Have 1992).","The population level in 2000 for the animals breeding in Canadian waters of the western North Atlantic, on “the Front” off Newfoundland and Labrador and in Gulf of St. Lawrence, was estimated to be 5.2 million animals (95% CI  4.0-6.5 million). Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans claims the population has recovered in the past from an estimated low of around 1.8 million in the early 1970s to more than 5 million today (Anon. 2005). The breeding group on the West Ice near Jan Mayen was estimated at 296,000 in 1994. The White Sea breeding group is made up of approximately 1.5-2.0 million animals as of 1999 (Lavigne 2002). Totaling the figures from Lavigne and each area estimate gives a world population of 5.8-8.8 million, making harp seals the most abundant pinniped in the Northern Hemisphere.",Unknown,"Harp seals are widespread in the North Atlantic and the adjacent Arctic Ocean. Their range extends from northern Hudson Bay and the Foxe Basin, Baffin Island, and the Davis Strait, and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Newfoundland in the western north Atlantic, east to somewhat south of Greenland, continuing east to Iceland and from there to Northern Norway, the White Sea and all of the Barents and Kara Seas. The northern limit in the eastern North Atlantic is at least to Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard and may continue to between 82-85 degrees north depending on ice conditions (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Rice 1998, Lavigne 2002). Harp seals often wander south outside this range and vagrants have reached the United Kingdom (Ronald and Healy 1981), the Faroe Islands, Denmark, Germany, France, and Spain (Heptner 1976, Van Bree 1997, Bloch <em>et al.</em> 2000).",Harp Seals are hunted for pelts and oil.,Terrestrial|Marine,"Canada has in place sealing regulations pursuant to the 1993 Marine Mammal Regulations that require annual quotas, referred to as “Total Allowable Catches,” hunting licenses, and official observers of the commercial hunt (Anon. 2005).  In the northeast Atlantic, quotas for sealing are based on recommendations made by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO).

Found in lowland primary, secondary forest, pine, dry dipterocarp, coastal swamp, montane forest. Frequently observed in riparian forests in western Thailand and Laos, occasionally near human settlements, cultivated fields where it once relatively common (back in 1990), even in highly degraded regions. Known to share associations with Assamese macaques (<em>Macaca assamemensis</em>) western Thailand and the ranges of the two species were observed to overlap in Assam. Range overlaps also with Stump-tailed and Rhesus macaques besides langurs and Hoolocks (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>This species eats more than 91 kinds of plants such as mature and tender leaves, leaf buds, leaf petioles, seeds, stems, climbers, roots, flowers, flower buds, inflorescences, bamboo shoots, and gums, insects, larvae, termite eggs and spiders. They also feed on post-harvest Rice paddy in NE India and fruits and vegetables by slash and burn agriculture of the hill tribe. Habituated groups have also been observed to beg for food and feed on biscuits as in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand.<br/><br/>In NE India, winter-spring breeding has been observed. Females are sexually receptive in August-December, but some might continue through to February. Birthing occurs in mid-January, early May, and a few in June. Swellings occur during breeding, as in Lion-tailed Macaques (<em>Macaca silenus</em>). Gestation period is 171-180 days (Choudhury 2008).<br/><br/>This species is primarily arboreal, but it may use both terrestrial and arboreal pathways; individuals flee from danger through trees and not by ground. They use the ground when crossing clearings, roads, to forage, feed in degraded areas and also feed on crops. Seasonal fluctuations dictate the time spent on the ground feeding on crops. One site reported macaques spending over 20% of their time feeding on the ground on sugar cane left overs by elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Detailed observation of the species in eastern and central Assam in 1992-1994 and 2004 recorded three peaks of feeding and long mid-day rest, shorter mid-morning rest spells, resting 45%, feeding 23.5%, locomotion 17-19.4%, grooming 6-8%. Actual time spent feeding 153-229 mins/day. Spent 65% of feeding time in January on harvested paddy.<br/><br/>In Assam (Tikleswari, Borajan) the macaques raids the vegetable gardens, crop field and villages (Chetry and Das pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is 83-347 ha, with about 25-48% overlap (Choudhury 2008). Daily movement is 690-2,240 m, influenced by weather and availability of fruits: where fruiting trees were far apart, the daily movement increased. Multi-male, multi-female groups of 12-40 individuals are seen (Choudhury 2008). Estimated group size in Laos rarely exceeds 20-30 individuals. There are few records of groups numbering 50-150 individuals in KhaoYai National Park in Thailand, DakLak Province in Viet Nam and DhouPhouVieng National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. It may be the case that two or more groups were feeding together.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km2 as studied in 21 sites.&#160; They spent only about 1% of their time on the ground and about 85% of their time on mid canopy and in 97.6% of the cases found inside the forest as opposed to the sympatric <em>M. mulatta </em>that is found outside forests in farms and gardens. Direct competition was found to be scarce between the species and the overlap or sharing of resources was only found to be 22.4%. Of the 101 plant species used between both the species, only 42.6%&#160; shared (Feroz, 2012).<br/><br/>In KhaoYai National Park,Thailand these macaques preferred tall sleeping trees (mean 20.9+/- SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’(15.8+/- SD 4.3 m) and tend to reuse the sleeping site, an anti-predator strategy (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Habitat disturbances affecting the future survival of this species include: selective logging; timber and firewood collection for making charcoal; building roads, dams, power lines; and deliberately setting fires. These threats lead to&#160; forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of&#160; India 2003) and the rate of habitat loss has not reduced. Recent forest cover survey report of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Government of India suggest that the dense forest cover in the distribution range is decreasing 2011-2013.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat&#160; loss likely is also a major threat to the&#160; species. In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000 USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, hunting, habitat loss and disturbance are major threats. There is a perceptible change in habitat quality that has an impact on the species (Huang <em>et al</em>. pers. comm).","In China, the species’ population is estimated to be less than 1,700 individuals (Jiang and Long pers. comm). No information is available on the status of the population dynamics, but it is suspected to be in decline. A very small population occurs in Bangladesh, which is isolated from the neighbouring Indian locations. This habitat is degrading rapidly, thereby causing a continuing decline in mature individuals in the country (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>A group density of 0.07 individuals/km² was recorded in Namdapha National Park, India, by Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003). There is no precise information available on population numbers in Myanmar. In India the population is &lt;1,500 individuals and populations are declining rapidly (Chetry and Das pers. comm.) but in one protected area (Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary) it is increasing. Choudhury (2003) stated that there may have been around 24,000 of these macaques in India at the turn of this century. The population has apparently declined owing to habitat loss.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km² as studied in 21 sites. The mean of seven groups in Assam was 23.3 (range: 16-33) (Choudhury 2008); however, the largest group observed was of 43 macaques in Radhakishorepur reserved forest, Tripura in 2016 (Choudhury 2017).<br/><br/>It is also declining steadily in Myanmar.&#160; The animals are very patchily distributed in Myanmar. <br/><br/>The species is widely distributed and common in large forest blocks remaining in southern and central Lao PDR, but it is much scarcer in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam (R. Timmins pers. comm). It is widely distributed through the remaining forest areas of Cambodia. Populations are stable in Thailand. <br/><br/>Declines are due to different threats in different countries. There have been declines of more than 30% in the last 30­-35 (three generations) years in India, Bangladesh, China, Viet Nam and Myanmar. There are perceptible declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia, but the rates are close to or lower than 30%. In most of the countries, the species is predicted to decline at a rate higher than 30% over the next three generations due to increasing trends in habitat loss, persecution, and trade.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China (southwestern Yunnan), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (Choudhury 1988, 2013)), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand (from about 8°N and including adjacent islands), and central and southern Viet Nam. There might be a gap in the distribution in central and northeastern Myanmar between about 20 and 25°N, where it has not been recorded except on the coast at Arakan. In India found north to the Brahmaputra River (Groves 2001).<br/><br/>Records from Xizang (China) are probably misidentified rhesus macaques (MacKinnon in press).  It has recently been recorded from Namdapha National Park in northeastern India (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>The precise taxonomic boundary between <em>M. leonina</em> and <em>M. nemestrina</em> is not well defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limits in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans. The two species hybridize in a small area of southern peninsular Thailand, as well as on the islands of Phuket and Yao Yai (Groves 2001).  <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there are historical records from as far north as Nghe An province, but there is uncertainty whether the species was ever found north of this province. It is widely distributed throughout the lower elevations (below 500 m) of Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is found over much Myanmar except in areas of human settlements.","In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. In almost throughout its range, the species is hunted for meat and for 'medicine'. Hunting is rampant in areas of development mainly for food.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed under CITES Appendix II. It is listed as Schedule III in the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974, Category I under the Chinese Wildlife Protection Act (1989), and as Schedule II under the Indian Wildlife(Protection) Act, 1972 (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003), amended up to 2002. In Indian context the species facing severe threats with few populations left and needs revision of the Indian status so that in can get better protection. Northern pig­tailed macaques are known to occur in numerous protected areas, including Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary, Lawachara National&#160; Park, Rema ­Kelanga Wildlife Sanctuary (Bangladesh); Daxueshan Nature Reserve, Nanguanhe Nature Reserve, WuliangshanNature Reserve, Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve (China); Balpakhram National Park, Dampa Wildlife Sanctuary, Dibru­Saikhowa National Park, Fakim Wildlife Sanctuary, Garampani Wildlife Sanctuary, Holongopar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary, Intanki National Park, Kamlang WildlifeSanctuary, Lengteng Wildlife Sanctuary, Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, Murlen NationalPark, Namdapha National Park, Ngengpui Wildlife Sanctuary, Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary, Bherjan-Boorajan-Podumoni Wildlife Sanctuary, Phawngpui Blue Mountain National Park, Sepahijala Wildlife Sanctuary, Siju Wildlife Sanctuary, Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Yangoupokpi­ Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary (India); Pidaung Wildlife Sanctuary (Myanmar); Doi Suthep Pui National Park, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Thailand); Cat Tien National Park, Pu Mat National Park (Viet Nam). The species possibly occurs in Nam Ha National Biodiversity Conservation Area (Lao PDR) (M. Richardson pers. comm.; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). In India, it has been recorded in at least 29 protected areas (Choudhury 2016).<br/><br/>The species is considered Critically Endangered in Bangladesh and Endangered in India.<br/><br/>Destruction and degradation due to encroachment, monoculture tree plantations, fisheries, slash and burn shifting cultivation, by hill tribes (cultural minorities). They are also killed for food by Hill tribes in NE India as they have access to automatic firearms. Poaching rampant in Assam-Mizoram border. Poaching rampant in Assam-Mizoram border. In China, it is variously described as rare and endangered and thought to number to <em>ca</em>1,000 about the year 2000. The species was classified as Vulnerable in the Red Data Book of Viet Nam in 1990. Poaching for traditional medicine is now a threat to all primates in the country and no new conservation program is in place.<br/><br/>Other direct threats include logging, gold mining, shifting cultivation by the hill tribe minority, development of economy and infrastructure resulting in habitat loss and degradation, hunting for food by villagers, hunting for traditional medicine to supply bone to the Viet Nam for use in medicine. Although in their incipient stage, agriculture, mining and hydropower are causing significant damages in terms of forest loss. In Cambodia, the species is reported only in five out of 24 provinces: use in traditional medicine, loss of habitat from logging, and trade are major threats in the region. In Myanmar, logging, plantation, aquaculture, hunting for food and pets, political unrest in cultural minority states impact primates. Timber extraction, large scale farms and plantations, irrigation, hydroelectric projects, highway construction, mineral exploration, resettlement programs for hill tribes, recreation and tourism, have significantly reduced forest cover in Thailand. Shifting cultivation of hill tribes and ethnic Thais have cleared large forests. Illegal hunting for sale(market hunting) and poaching for food near villages could have a direct effect on primate population in Thailand, including <em>Macaca leonina</em>. The Western Conservation Corridor, western Thailand may offer protection to both habitat and wildlife.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

18494149,19496,Rhinoceros unicornis,Vulnerable,B2ab(iii),2019,2018-12-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros populations are increasing overall due to strict protection and habitat management in both India and Nepal. The species is found in 12 sites, with a total area of occupancy less than 2,000 km². Useable habitat changes periodically with monsoon flooding, especially in Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, and Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary. Populations are severely fragmented, and more than 70% of the population is found in Assam's Kaziranga National Park; a catastrophic event there could have a devastating impact on the species. Habitat loss and degradation due to invasion by alien plants into grasslands, grazing, human encroachment and silting up is occurring in part of the species' range,","The species inhabits the riverine grasslands of the Terai and Brahmaputra Basins (Foose and van Strien 1997). The species prefers these alluvial plain grasslands, but was known to occur in adjacent swamps and forests. The populations are currently restricted to habitats surrounded by human-dominated landscapes, so that the species often occurs in adjacent cultivated areas, pastures, and secondary forests. The diet includes mainly grasses, but also some fruit, leaves, shrub and tree branches, and cultivated crops (Nowak 1999). Greater One-horned Rhinos also regularly utilize mineral licks. Males are solitary, with unstructured, overlapping territories. Females are solitary unless they have a calf. Calves remain with their mother for 3-4 years.<br/><br/>Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at 30-45 years, gestation length of approximately 16 months (as with other rhino species), and age at sexual maturity estimated at 5-7 years for females and 8-10 years for males (Nowak 1999, International Rhino Foundation website 2018).","The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros declined to near extinction in the early 1900s, primarily due to widespread conversion of alluvial plains grasslands to agricultural development, which led to human-rhino conflicts and easier accessibility for hunters. Sport hunting became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A reversal of government policies shortly thereafter protected many of the remaining populations. However, poaching, mainly for the use of the horn in Traditional Asian Medicine, has remained a constant threat and the success is precarious without continued support for conservation efforts in India and Nepal. Past poaching led to declines in several important populations, especially those in Chitwan, Manas, Laokhowa, and the Babai Valley area of Bardia, but in the past 5 years, poaching has decreased and the populations in these areas are increasing (except for Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary).<br/><br/>However, not all recent population decreases can be linked to poaching. There have been serious declines in quality of habitat in some areas. This is due to: 1) severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations; 2) demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels; and 3) grazing by domestic livestock. In Chitwan National Park (the second largest population), poaching alone does not account for the observed level of population decline (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.), and there are trends in a number of reproductive indicators (i.e., decline in the percentage of adult females calving and in the percentage of the population that is calves) that are strongly indicative of negative changes in habitat quality. In Chitwan, there has been severe infestation of some riverine and grassland areas by the climbing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mikania micrantha</span> (which covers over indigenous vegetation), and invasion of <em>Eupatorium</em> in other areas (Murphy, et al., 2013). There is also heavy livestock grazing pressure and disturbance in buffer zone areas as well as some invasion of grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>In India, there is not yet any evidence that invasion by alien plants has caused any population decreases. However, in Orang National Park, there have been marked habitat changes due to grazing, human encroachment and silting up. In particular, short grass areas have declined by 75% due to silting up and draining of <em>beels, </em>lake-like wetlands with static water&#160;(B.N. Talukdar, pers. comm.). <em>Mimosa</em> is also an alien invader in this area. In the Karnali floodplain area of Bardia there is also some invasion of habitat by the alien <em>Lantana camara</em>. <br/><br/>In Pabitora, there has been an invasion of <em>Ipomoea s</em><em>pp.</em>&#160;""weeds"" and <em>Parthenium spp.</em>&#160;into grassland areas (S. Dutta, pers. comm.). There also has been an invasion of woodland into grassland and siltation and drying up of some water bodies. There also has been some human encroachment and very heavy livestock grazing. With increasing human densities this pressure is unlikely to get any less (S. Dutta pers. comm.). Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that there has a substantial increase in woodland (34.51%) in Pabitora since 1977 accompanied by decline in alluvial grassland (68%)&#160;(Sarma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). This change of habitat is mostly because of natural succession process, livestock grazing from the nearby villages as well as improper management of the grassland habitat (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/>The West Bengal populations (Jaldapara and Gorumara) are affected by high levels of grazing from fringe villages, and there have been weed and climber infestations by <em>Mikania cordata</em>, <em>M. scandens</em>, <em>Lantana camara, Christella dentata,</em> and <em>Leea</em> spp. <br/> <br/>The species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. This area, is subject to poaching and tensions with the surrounding high human population due to human-wildlife conflicts (including conflicts with rhinos). The level of poaching in Kaziranga has generally not been at a level to prevent the ongoing increase in the population, but constant vigilance is required. At least 12 rhinos were lost in the July 2019 monsoon floods, and numerous calves were rescued. Any severe catastrophic event in Kaziranga (such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, habitat loss, etc.) would have a devastating impact on the species.<br/><br/>During surveys carried out in February 2019, Jaldapara and Gorumara reported figures of 231 and 52 rhinos respectively - the highest numbers recorded during the last 100 years. There are suggestions that the two protected areas have reached their carrying capacities and suitable areas need to be found for the West Bengal populations. A male:female:unknown sex ratio of 3.8.1 has been reported in the Gorumara population based on dung DNA analysis (Borkathur, <em>et al</em>. 2016). As a result, fights among bulls are very common and these animals often stray out of the National Park, leading to human-wildlife conflicts (S. S. Bist, pers. comm).<br/><br/>There are suggestions that the small population of rhinos in Jaldapara and Gorumara may be prone to inbreeding depression (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There have been proposals to dam the Bramaphutra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen in future things could very negatively affect the habitat quality and rhino carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods). In Jaldapara National Park, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in Jaldapara National Park is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools used by rhinos are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist, pers. comm).","The total population estimate in August 2018 was estimated to be 3,588 individuals, with estimates of 649 animals in Nepal and 2,939 in India (B. Talukdar pers. comm.). The greater one-horned rhino, with strict protection from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, has recovered from very low numbers in the early 1900s. Only 12 rhinos remained in Kaziranga National Park in 1905; it is unknown how many animals existed in the combined India-Nepal populations at that time. Although some populations have declined in recent years, overall the species has continued to increase for almost 100 years.<br/><br/><strong>India</strong><br/>The species exists in several protected areas in India: Dudhwa National Park, Manas National Park, Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara National Park, and Gorumara National Park. Kaziranga National Park, which was established as a reserve for the last 12 Indian rhinos in Assam in 1905, is home to more than 70% of the global population. A population has been re-established in Manas National Park under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 program (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2015), where greater one-horned rhinos had extirpated in the late 1990s/early 2000s during a civil conflict. <br/><br/>Poaching rendered the species extinct in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary by the mid-1990s (Foose and van Strien 1997). Stray animals are occasionally seen in Laokhowa and Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuaries. There also were record from Valmiki Reserve in Bihar, which has habitat contiguity with Chitwan National Park (A.U. Choudhury, pers. comm.). The population in Katerniaghat is best described as transient (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Nepal</strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1960s, an estimated 65 Indian rhinos survived in Nepal, but due to increased conservation efforts, the total population grew to 649 in 2018. During a period of insurgency from 2000-2003, at least 91 animals were poached (Martin 2004) but poaching rates have significantly decreased within the last decade. In Royal Chitwan National Park, the population declined from 544 individuals in 2000 to 372 individuals in 2005 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007), but has since rebounded to 592 in 2018. In Royal Bardia National Park (where rhinos were re-introduced) there were approximately 40 individuals in 1997 (Foose and van Strien, 1997) and 37 animals in 2007 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007). The population reached a low of 17 animals in the early 2000s, but by 2018 has&#160;grown to roughly 30 individuals, including five animals&#160;translocated&#160;from Royal Chitwan National Park in 2016-2017. In Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (where the species was also re-introduced), the population was only six individuals (Martin 2004, IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007) but by August 2018 had grown to 17, including two rhinos translocated in 2016-2017 from Royal Chitwan National Park. There is a tiny population in Parsa.",Increasing,"Historically, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros once existed across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra River basins, from Pakistan to the Indian-Burmese border, including parts of Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan (Foose and van Strien 1997). It may also have existed in Myanmar, southern China, and Indochina, although this is uncertain. The species was common in northwestern India and Pakistan until around 1600, but disappeared from this region shortly after this time (Rookmaker 1984). The species declined sharply in the rest of its range from 1600-1900, until it was on the brink of extinction at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Currently, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros is found in eight protected areas in India&#160;(Kaziranga, Pabitora, Manas, Orang, Jaldapara, Gorumara, Dudhwa, Katerniaghat)&#160;and in four protected areas in Nepal (Chitwan, Bardia, Suklaphanta, Parsa) (Foose and van Strien 1997, Ellis, <em>et al.</em> 2015, Emslie <em>et al. </em>2016). In India, rhinoceros from Gorumara National Park frequently visit adjoining forests; Nepali rhinos frequently visit adjoining areas in India.",This species is harvested illegally for its horn and other products used in Traditional Asian Medicine and as a status symbol in Vietnam and China. Myanmar has become the transit route for horn coming from India and Nepal.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1975. The Indian and Nepalese governments have taken major steps towards Greater One-horned Rhinoceros conservation, often with assistance from non-governmental organizations.<br/><br/>Greater One-horned Rhino populations occur almost exclusively within and around Protected Areas. In India, the species occurs in Kaziranga National Park (World Heritage Site), Manas National Park (World Heritage Site), Dudhwa National Park (re-introduced population), Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, and Gorumara National Park. In Nepal, the species occurs in Royal Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park (re-introduced population), and Royal Suklaphanta Wildife Reserve (a small re-introduced population). Stray rhinos are recorded in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary, and Valmiki Tiger Reserve (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm).<br/><br/>Strict anti-poaching measures are needed to maintain all of these populations. It is also important to reduce human-wildlife conflicts around these areas, and this might involve fencing. Many of the areas also require targeted programmes to control invasive plants, to prevent the spread of woodland, to safeguard wetlands through appropriate water management, and to limit the extent of grazing by domestic livestock. In Pabitora, specific recommendations have been made to increase the quality of feeding habitat of rhino within the sanctuary through meticulous manipulation and checking livestock grazing (Sarma <em>et al</em>., 2009). Water holding mechanisms within the sanctuary during winter are crucial in terms of keeping moist grassland available in winter seasons, thereby reducing the number of rhinos straying out of the sanctuary and thus exposing themselves to poaching (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The Indian Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has embarked on a project to create DNA profiles of all the country's rhinos in collaboration with WWF-India and the Wildlife Institute of India (S.S. Bist pers. comm).<br/><br/>The area of Kaziranga National Park has officially been extended, although animals had access to this area previously as the original park area was not fenced. In West Bengal (Jaldapara and Gorumara), there is a programme of habitat improvement in old teak areas, weed control is being carried out in 50-60 ha annually.<br/><br/>Grasslands in India are being improved through controlled burning and planting of fodder species. Artificial wallow and water conservation structure have been created. Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary had was upgraded to a National Park in 2012. The government of West Bengal has been developing an 21-km<sup>2</sup> site in Coochbehar District to accommodate surplus animals from Jaldapara and Gorumara National Parks, and other sites are being considered (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>With the support of the IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group, Indian Rhino Vision 2020 and a Nepal Rhino Action Plan (Government of Nepal 2006) have been developed. These cover a number of important and specific conservation measures, including translocating rhinos to bolster struggling populations and to start new populations (e.g., Manas National Park); improving security around rhino populations and reducing poaching; assessing habitat status and management needs; expanding available habitat through active management; improving protected area infrastructure; training staff in specific rhino conservation techniques; reducing human-wildlife conflicts; involving local people in rhino conservation; and implementing education and awareness programmes. Overall, there is a need for further reintroductions, thereby reducing the concentration of more than 70% of the individuals in one large population.<br/><br/>To further strengthen rhino protection in Assam, the government amended the Wildlife Protection Act - 1972 in 2009 with increased sentences and fines for poaching rhinos. Further, 12 fast-track courts have been designated in 12 districts of Assam to speed up cases related to wildlife species, specifically rhinos.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Although the species occurs in a variety of habitats and it is able to survive under human-disturbed conditions, in these latter areas domestic and feral dogs and cats represent a threat.","<em>Spilogale pygmaea</em> inhabits deciduous tropical forest, semi-evergreen forest, and desert scrub (Ceballos and Miranda 1986). One specimen was obtained in coastal sand dunes with only herbaceous vegetation cover (López-Forment and Urbano 1979). Most individuals have been found in undisturbed habitats and den use suggests that they still are dependent on forests (Cantú-Salazar <em>et al</em>. 2009). Altitudinal distribution is usually 0-100 m above sea level (Van Gelder 1959), with records up to 1,630 m a.s.l.

In a&#160;survey of two oil palm plantations in central&#160;Sumatra (where it was the only civet recorded), it was common even in their interior (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Radio-tracking studies have revealed home-ranges of up to 17 km² for males and 1.6 km² for females (Dhungle and Edge 1985, Rabinowitz 1991, Joshi <em>et al</em>. 1995, Grassman 1998). <br/><br/>This species is adapted for forest living, yet it tolerates living in areas near people: commuting along wires and pipes, sleeping in barns, drains, or roofs during the day, and coming out at night to catch rats or forage for mango, coffee, pineapples, melons, and bananas; it also eats insects and molluscs (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Spaan <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is&#160;crepuscular or nocturnal (e.g., Duckworth 1997,&#160;Azlan 2005). It is&#160;partly arboreal (Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1985) and&#160;the extent of arboreal activity perhaps varies across its range or between habitats: it is often among the most commonly photographed small carnivores by ground-level camera-traps, yet extensive camera-trapping in an oil-palm plantation in East Kalimantan did not record it at all, until camera-traps were placed up trees, when it was found to be common (Wahyudi and Stuebing 2013).","Common Palm Civet is hunted (often a part of general take, using non-selective methods) for wild meat in some parts of its range, such as southern China,&#160;parts of North-east India (especially in Nagaland and hilly areas of Manipur),&#160;Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Thailand and probably throughout northern South-east Asia and widely elsewhere in its range (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Dead individuals of this species were found with local tribes during a visit to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and Agra, Uttar Pradesh in India between 1998 and 2003, where it is killed for its meat (Gupta 2004).&#160;Hunting in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India, has apparently much declined (Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), and this&#160;is&#160;probably typical for India excepting the North-east. It is commonly sold in Javan,&#160;and to a lesser extent Philippine,&#160;markets for the pet trade (Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;It is also persecuted as a pest (e.g., Gupta 2004, Su Su 2005) although it seems able to tolerate very high levels of persecution (e.g. Duckworth 1997). While these pressures are certainly having localised effects on populations in highly fragmented and ‘humanised’ areas,&#160;such as&#160;Houay Nhang (Lao PDR), there is no evidence in mainland South-east Asia of them significantly reducing the population levels in large tracts of natural and semi-natural habitat, even in the heavily hunted countries of Lao PDR and Viet Nam; while in much of India it is a common urban commensal (e.g. Gupta 2004). There has been a recent great&#160;increase in numbers&#160;kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g. Shepherd 2012, Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and to&#160;a lesser extent, in the Philippines (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Large numbers of live Common Palm Civets are traded internationally and when trade confiscations occur, animals are typically released close to site of confiscation. Given that some trade goes from Sundaic South-east Asia to China (e.g. Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;it is highly likely that many individuals of one clade/subspecies/species (see 'Taxonomic notes') are being released within the range of another; this has the risk of hybridisation/introgression, or of competitive exclusion (depending on whether the different forms are reproductively isolated; this remains unknown).","Across its wide range, Common Palm Civet is often one of the most commonly recorded species of small carnivore. Across its range it has been found commonly in degraded and anthropogenic habitats,&#160;with some records from even&#160;the most degraded small isolates amid human environments, such as Houay Nhang in Lao PDR and Hlawga in Myanmar. In North-east India and non-Sundaic South-east Asia&#160;it is common in the remote interiors of large blocks of closed evergreen forest, whereas in mainland India (certainly) and in Sundaic South-east Asia (perhaps) it is rare in in such habitat, while still common in degraded and edge habitats (Duckworth 1997,&#160;Esselstyn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004,&#160;Su Su 2005, Holden 2006, Belden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Mudappa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Roberton 2007,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Holden and Neang 2009, Wilting&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Low 2011, Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Samejima and Semiadi 2012,&#160;Choudhury 2013, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013, Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Nakashima&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Kakati and Srikant 2014,&#160;Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3,&#160;Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, McCarthy and Fuller&#160;2014). In southern China where it is extensively hunted, it is mostly not common, perhaps as a result of decline (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), but these areas (Guangxi and Guangdong) also comprise the edge of its range. The recent rapid rise in production of 'civet coffee', a practice using mainly this species, and a new craze for keeping this species as a 'pet' have both presumably resulted in greatly increased off-take from the wild in Indonesia; there is no meaningful information as to the effects of these recent changes (Shepherd 2012, D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2014, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Civet coffee farms are also expanding rapidly in Viet Nam (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Together with ongoing hunting pressure, particularly in northern South-east Asia, it is likely that the global population is in decline. Given the large areas with only minimal off-take, such declines are at present likely to be very shallow.",Decreasing,"Common Palm Civet has a wide distribution in South and South-east Asia from Afghanistan in the west to Hainan and the adjacent Chinese coast in the east; it occurs widely on&#160;South-east Asian islands, but&#160;the natural pattern of occurrence there is uncertain, given the evidence of introduction by people&#160;(Patou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Stevens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Animals in Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas eastwards appear to be introductions, while the Philippine archipelago might have been colonised naturally but also might stem entirely from introductions (Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Its recorded distribution in China is restricted, to Hainan,&#160;southern Guangdong (perhaps based on a trade animal),&#160;south-western Guangxi, much of Yunnan and south-western Sichuan provinces (Wang 2003, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010).

It is increasingly kept as a 'pet' and kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g., Shepherd 2012, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Terrestrial,"Common Palm Civet is found within many protected areas across its range (e.g. Lao PDR&#160;–&#160;Duckworth 1997; Viet Nam – Roberton 2007, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3; Cambodia – Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014; Myanmar – Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008; Thailand&#160;–&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014; Singapore&#160;–&#160;Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012; China&#160;–&#160;Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010; North-east India&#160;–&#160;Choudhury 2013; Borneo&#160;–&#160;Nakabayashi <em>et al</em>. in prep.; Java&#160;–&#160;Rode-Margono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This species is listed on CITES Appendix III (India).&#160;It&#160;is protected in Malaysia (Azlan pers. comm. 2006), India (on Schedule II part II of the Wildlife Protection Act (2004)), Sichuan, China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2000), Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008) and Bangladesh (under the Wildlife Act 2012; Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), but not in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is listed as Vulnerable on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004). Its adaptability to modified habitats (including towns and cities) and resilience in the face of heavy general hunting means that at present no conservation interventions are needed. However, the effects of the recent rapid rise in targeted off-take, for civet coffee and the pet trade, in parts of its range (notably Indonesia) are unknown; surveillance of trade levels and investigation of effects on wild populations are warranted (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
50361589,11143,Lagenorhynchus australis,Least Concern,,2019,2018-07-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There has been considerable improvement in the amount and quality of information about Peale’s Dolphin&#160;(<em>Lagenorhy</em><em>nchus australis)</em><em> </em>since the previous assessments in 1996 and 2008, both of which resulted in listing the species as Data Deficient. The currently available information is still somewhat limited making a rigorous evaluation against the Red List criteria challenging, particularly with regard to population size, trends, and threats. However, since the last assessment, abundance estimates have become available for the South Atlantic part of the species’ range indicating that Peale’s Dolphins number in the low tens of thousands (~21,800 combined point estimates for the Patagonian shelf and the Falkland Islands). Equivalent information for the South Pacific is not available. Based on existing sighting records, Peale’s Dolphins are the most frequently encountered small cetacean in the southern Chilean fjords. Overall, there is no evidence for significant population declines or high levels of anthropogenic mortality that might be cause for concern anywhere in the species’ range. There is reasonable evidence to suggest that Peale’s Dolphin is widespread, abundant, and not in decline in any major part of its range. Therefore, the species is assessed as Least Concern.<br/><br/>Further research is needed to obtain abundance estimates for the South Pacific part of the species’ range as well as more up-to-date quantitative information on human-caused mortality.</p>","<p>Peale’s Dolphins occur in coastal neritic (shelf water) habitats. In the South Atlantic they range widely over the Patagonian shelf from the wave-washed shoreline out to the 200 m isobath several tens of km offshore (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Dellabianca <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Tierra del Fuego and southern Chile, they inhabit deep channels and fjords, but are most frequently seen along the rocky shores rather than in the deep sections of the channels (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1997a, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In the Chiloé archipelago Peale’s Dolphins prefer shallow waters (&lt;30 m) along more exposed shorelines or over shoals (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> submitted). Around the Falkland Islands Peale’s Dolphins are found both close to shore as well as offshore to the 100 m isobath (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2018). This wide range of neritic habitats suggests some degree of ecological flexibility.</p>  <p>The diet of Peale’s Dolphins is not well known, but stomach analyses from individuals in the southwestern South Atlantic identified mostly demersal and bottom fishes, and octopus and squid species (Schiavini <em>et al.</em> 1997) which commonly occur over the continental shelf and in kelp beds. Observational studies support the notion that Peale’s Dolphins strongly associate with coastal kelp beds (<em>Macrocystis</em> sp.) (de Haro and Iniguez 1997, Viddi and Lescrauwaet 2005, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2011). Stable isotope analyses of dolphin bones suggested that coastal-benthic species such as zoarcids and nototheniod fishes and nearshore pelagic species (e.g., <em>Odonthestes</em> spp.) are important food sources for this species in Tierra del Fuego (Riccialdelli <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>Over much of their range Peale's Dolphins are broadly sympatric with Dusky Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</em>) although their habitat usage differs sufficiently to provide some spatial separation (Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2010). The two species co-occur and sometimes form mixed groups in the Beagle Channel, at the southern extreme of the distribution of Dusky Dolphins (Dellabianca <em>et al</em>. 2018). Peale’s and Dusky Dolphins can be difficult to differentiate at sea (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a,b) leading to some uncertainty about species identification for sightings reported further offshore or from the extreme northern and southern parts of the range. Peale’s Dolphins frequently associate with other cetacean species, especially Commerson’s Dolphins (<em>Cephalorhynchus commersonii</em>). They are also known for their boat-positive behavior, readily approaching moving vessels to ride the bow wave (Cipriano 2018).</p>  <p>Limited evidence from individual identification studies suggests that some Peale’s Dolphins are resident in nearshore waters throughout the year, but some might also range widely alongshore (Lescrauwaet 1997, Heinrich 2006). Calves have been reported from spring through autumn, but population biology and dynamics remain poorly understood.</p>","<p>From the 1970s to the late 1980s Peale's Dolphins were hunted extensively with harpoons in the Strait of Magellan and around Tierra del Fuego, where the meat was used as bait in crab traps set for Centolla (Southern King Crab, <em>Lithodes antarctica</em><em>) </em>and Centollon (False King Crab, <em>Paralomis granulosa</em>) (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1994). Sielfeld <em>et al</em>. (1977) estimated that some 2,350 dolphins, including both <em>Peale’s </em>and <em>Commerson’s Dolphins</em>, were killed during the 1976/1977 crab-fishing season in the Strait of Magellan and the Chilean part of the Beagle Channel. This level of take across a number of years could have had a significant impact on the Peale’s Dolphin population in that area. Dolphin takes in the Argentinean sector were also significant (Goodall and Cameron 1980) but are thought to have stopped by the mid-1980s (Cipriano 2018). In Chile, exploitation for bait appears to have ceased later, by the mid-1990s (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 2008). However, some degree of uncertainty remains as alternative bait sources might not always be readily available, alternative bait prices fluctuate and official monitoring of bait usage and dolphin mortality remains sketchy (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 2008). Direct hunting of dolphins has been prohibited in Chile since 1977. Although all dolphin deaths in fisheries should be reported to the Chilean Fisheries authorities, this is not always the case. </p>  <p>Peale's Dolphins were reported to become entangled incidentally and drown in coastal gillnets along the open coasts of southern Chile and Tierra del Fuego, southern Argentina (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1994, Reyes and Oporto 1994). In all areas, entanglement cases involving Peale’s Dolphins were reported less frequent than cases involving sympatric small cetaceans. There are no reports of incidental entanglements for the northern parts of Peale’s Dolphin’s Atlantic range (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1994) or in offshore trawl fisheries that are known to catch substantial numbers of other small cetaceans (Crespo <em>et al</em> 1997). Most of the entanglement information is now more than 30 years old, and current levels of bycatch of Peale’s Dolphins are not known. However, there do not appear to be particular fisheries or regions where they form a noticeable part of the incidental catch of small cetaceans. </p>  Other human activities with the potential to affect Peale’s Dolphins include the already large-scale and expanding aquaculture operations, particularly those involving farming of salmonids in southern Chile, and continued oil and gas development off southern Argentina. There is no information at present to consider if these industries are having substantial direct effects on Peale’s Dolphins, but their potential effects on the local ecosystem and the species that depend upon it mean that such activities should be monitored closely.","<p>The first abundance estimates for Peale’s Dolphins recently became available for the South Atlantic part of their range. Using density surface modelling with non-systematically collected vessel-based survey data gathered between 2009 and 2015, Dellabianca <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated 19,924 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) =0.2) to occur over the Patagonian shelf. The study could not account for the likely strong attraction bias arising from Peale’s Dolphins readily approaching vessels (i.e., possibly biasing estimates high) and also might have underestimated uncertainty. For inshore waters of the Falkland Islands, Costa <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimated 1,896 Peale’s Dolphins (CV=0.33) using design-based line transect methods and systematic aerial survey data collected in 2017. </p>  <p>No comparable abundance estimates exist for the South Pacific part of Peale’s Dolphin’s range. However, this species is reportedly the most commonly sighted cetacean in the Chilean fjords (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Gibbons <em>et al.,</em> 2002, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al.</em> 2010). Although observed group sizes tend to be small (average number of individuals 4-5, range 1-15), the number of dolphins seen during boat surveys in the main navigation channels adds up to hundreds of individuals. Gibbons <em>et al.</em> (2002) used simple encounter rate measures to generate a crude estimate of around 2,400 individuals for the Magallanes region (49°-56°S). In addition, during the period 2001-2004 around 200 Peale’s Dolphins were estimated in the nearshore waters of southern and central Chiloé island (42-43°S) using photo-identification and mark-recapture techniques (Heinrich 2006). The species’ distribution and abundance along the open coast in the northern part of their range in Chile (Chiloé to Valparaíso) remain poorly known.</p>",Unknown,"Peale's Dolphins appear confined to shelf waters off southern South America, ranging from Valparaíso, Chile (33°S) south to Cape Horn (56°S) and along the Patagonian Shelf to northern Argentina (38°S) (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Cipriano 2018). Their South Atlantic range extends east to the Falkland Islands where the species is regularly observed near the coast. Peale’s Dolphins are also occasionally sighted over the continental shelf south of Cape Horn.","The Peale’s Dolphin was hunted for use as bait in crab fisheries (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994). The current scale of this taking is unknown, but if it persists, is likely to be small and sporadic.",Marine,<p>The Peale's Dolphinis on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). <br/> <br/> Recommended actions for conservation include cooperative research on biology and abundance and a thorough assessment of anthropogenic threats throughout the species’ range. Given the extensive range of this species population genetic studies should be a priority. Ongoing genetic studies indicate some differences in the mtDNA control regions of Peale’s Dolphins in the East and West Falkland Islands raising the possibility of population structuring along the continental coasts (Baker <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>,Neotropical,,false,false,Global

82344448,10276,Parahyaena brunnea,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-10-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Near Threatened as the mean global population size is estimated to be below 10,000 mature individuals, and it experiences a measure of deliberate and incidental persecution such that it may come close to meeting a continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations (24 years). It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion C1.","The Brown Hyaena is found in dry areas, generally with annual rainfall less than 100 mm, particularly along the coast, semi-desert, open scrub and open woodland savanna with a maximum rainfall up to about 700 mm. It shows an ability to survive close to urban areas. It is predominantly nocturnal in its activity (Hulsman <em>et al</em>. 2010). The&#160;Brown Hyaena&#160;is independent of drinking water, but needs some type of cover in which to lie up during the day. For this it favours rocky, mountainous areas with bush cover in the bushveld areas of South Africa (Skinner 1976). It is primarily a scavenger of a wide range of vertebrate remains, which is supplemented by wild fruit and other plant material, insects, birds’ eggs, and the occasional small animal which is killed; their impact on domestic livestock is usually very small (Mills 1998, 1990; Maude and Mills 2005; Schiess-Meier <em>et al</em>. 2007). On Namibian farmlands, Brown Hyaenas often scavenge from leopard kills (Stein <em>et al.</em> 2013). Along the Namib Desert Coast, Brown Hyaenas are successful hunters of Cape Fur Seal pups (e.g. Wiesel 2006, Wiesel 2010). Populations of Brown Hyaenas in non-protected areas comprise a significant proportion of the global population, suggesting that such areas are likely to be important for their sustained conservation (Kent and Hill 2013, Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2013). Working in areas occupied by pastoralist herders, Maude and Mills              (2005) found, that, although Brown Hyaenas feed on carcasses of livestock, there was no evidence to suggest that Brown Hyaenas hunted livestock, or any other significantly sized mammals. Thus the persecution of them because of perceived livestock predation is unjustified. The dietary benefit derived by the Brown Hyaenas from the presence of subsistence pastoralists and their livestock carcasses, may be the primary reason that Brown Hyaena populations are viable in cattle areas (Maude and Mills&#160;2005).","Outside protected areas, the Brown Hyaena may come into conflict with humans, and they are often shot, poisoned, trapped and hunted with dogs in predator eradication or control programmes, or inadvertently killed in non-selective control programs (Mills 1998). Brown Hyaena body parts are used in traditional medicine and Brown Hyaenas are also often unintentional victims of lethal problem animal  control through poisons and poaching through snares (I. Wiesel, C. Edwards, L. Boast and R. Yarnell pers. comms. 2014). Lethal control remains the most predominant form of conflict resolution. The Brown Hyaena is regarded as a threat to livestock in some areas, and over 72% of livestock owners in Namibia believe that the Brown Hyaena is responsible for losses (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013), despite the finding that Brown Hyaenas very seldom prey on livestock (Maude and Mills&#160;2005). In South Africa's North West Province 40% of livestock owners regard the Brown Hyaena as a problem animal (Thorn 2008), but in the North West Province, only 6% of surveyed farmers admit to having killed&#160;Brown Hyaenas&#160;on their property (St John <em>et al</em>. 2011). Persecution in small stock areas in Namibia has lead to the local extinction of Brown Hyaenas in the southeastern parts of that country, where increasing conflict may lead to further population decline.","The total population size on the continent has been estimated as at a minimum of 5,000 to 8,000 individuals, with Botswana having the largest population (an estimated 3,900 animals; ,Hofer and Mills 1998b). However, numbers for Botswana may be higher, as one density study for the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Makgadikgadi Pans estimates the park's Brown Hyaena population at 2,253 animals (G. Maude pers. comm.). Winterbach and Winterbach (2014) estimate Botswana's total population in 2014 between 2,799 and 5,271 animals. &#160;A recent national population estimate for Namibia puts the number of Brown Hyaenas at 566-2,440 animals (Stein <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thorn (2008, unpublished PhD thesis) estimates South Africa's population at 1,007 (31-2,316) animals. No recent population size estimates are available for Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Lesotho or Swaziland. Mean density of Brown Hyaenas on farmlands in Botswana was 2.3 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> based on camera trap data, and 2.88 per 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;based on spoor surveys (Kent and Hill 2013). Thorn <em>et al</em>. (2009)                     estimated population density in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, at 2.8 per 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>.      			 				 					<p><br/></p>",Stable,"This species is endemic to southern Africa with a marginal extension into the arid parts of southwestern Angola, southeastern Botswana, and the northern and western Cape regions of the Republic of South Africa. Almost 90% of the Brown Hyena population in Botswana occurs in the Southern Conservation Zone (Winterbach <em>et al</em>. 2014). The range of the Brown Hyaena has shrunk significantly since the end of the 18th century when it was last recorded from Table Bay in the extreme southwest of the continent (Hofer and Mills 1998a, Mills 1990). They remain widespread in southern Africa, and in recent years in South Africa have been recorded from the extreme south in the Western Cape (Gansbaai and Bredasdorp), possibly vagrants from a small population in the Little Karoo (Yarnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thorn <em>et al</em>. (2011a) found that Brown Hyena distribution in northern South Africa was larger than in previous estimates. However, in farm land in this same area, Brown Hyaena occupancy was estimated at 0.748 (±SE 0.1), and estimated overall density in agricultural land (0.15/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, ±SE 0.08), which was an order of magnitude lower than in protected areas (Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011b). Boast and Houser (2012) also found that Brown Hyena distribution in Ghanzi, Botswana was larger than previously believed. Several re-introductions have taken place in South Africa's Eastern Cape (e.g., Shamwari Game Reserve; Slater and Muller 2014), and sightings have since been recorded there (e.g., Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). Other range expansions have also been recorded from South Africa (Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Recent studies from Zimbabwe show a range expansion into the north/northwest region of the country (E. van der Meer pers. comm. 2014) and into the east (R. Groom pers. comm. 2014). They seem to be absent from southeast Namibia (I. Wiesel pers. comm. 2014) and the Zambezi region (former Caprivi Strip; L. Hanssen pers. comm. 2014). No recent records are available from the central and western parts of South Africa's Northern Cape Province. Records from Malawi are erroneous (see discussion in Ansell and Dowsett 1988).",The bones and other parts of Brown Hyaenas are used for traditional medicinal and ritual purposes. Animals are also hunted by trophy hunters.,Terrestrial,"Brown Hyaenas occur in a number of large conservation areas, including: Namib-Naukluft, Skeleton Coast, Tsau//Khaeb (Sperrgebiet) and Etosha National Parks (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa, Botswana), Makgadikgadi National Park (Botswana), Pilanesberg National Park (South Africa), Shamwari Game Reserve (Eastern Cape, South Africa), and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (Botswana). A recent study from Botswana suggested that a significant proportion of the global Brown Hyaena population is found in non-protected areas, and that these animals can also tolerate land-use changes under some circumstances (Kent and Hill 2013). Boast and Houser (2012) found that Brown Hyaenas occurred evenly on game and cattle farms in Botswana, and in Namibia 54.5% of farm owners reported Brown Hyaena presence (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased efforts to educate farmers and pastoralists about the fact that Brown Hyenas pose very little risk to livestock is likely to enhance conservation of these animals.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
97168578,22104,Trichechus senegalensis,Vulnerable,A3cd; C1,2015,2015-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is data limited with little new quantitative information since the previous assessment. Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

Often found near human settelments, in agricultural fields. Higher density found near water, at places with good food sources and mixed biotopes. Inhabits abandoned burrows of other species such as marmots, susliks and ground squirrels, and hibernates through the winter until April. <br/>Breeds once per year in June/July. Litter size is 3 to 7 pups, youngs become independent at 7-8 weeks old. Youngs cover long distances during depersal before hibernation. Base of the diet are beetles, orthopteroids and other invertebrates. Sometimes feeds on small reptiles, bird eggs and nestlings, small rodents and carrion. Main predator is badger, rarely wolf, fox, eagle, and eagle owl.<br/>(Sokolov and Orlov, 1980; Pavlinov, 2002).","Habitat loss through increased mining activities, and grazing by increasing livestock numbers may create habitat degradation. Occasional accidental vehicular mortality also constitutes a low level threat.

156932432,22563,Tursiops truncatus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-05-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is among the most common cetacean species globally. These dolphins are distributed worldwide in all three major ocean basins and the Mediterranean Sea. They occur in tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters. The sum of available abundance estimates is around 750,000, however the vast majority of the species’ range has not been surveyed therefore actual abundance is considerably higher.</p>  <p>Coastal populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin are often small and resident and many of them are threatened by human activities. This species is bycaught in fishing gear throughout their range but quantitative data on bycatch rates are lacking in most areas. Several populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin are of particular conservation concern, including the Fiordland subpopulation in New Zealand which is classified as Critically Endangered (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013) the Mediterranean subpopulation which is classified as vulnerable (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the Black Sea subspecies which is classified as endangered (Birkum 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Some additional discrete resident populations face serious threats from a variety of sources that are resulting in significant population declines, and some of these (e.g., potentially the Gulf of California, Amvrakikos Gulf, or Slovenia populations) may be assessed as separate subpopulations on the Red List in the future. Despite all of this, the Common Bottlenose Dolphin is still one of the most widespread and abundant cetacean species, and to date there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a global population decline. This species was listed as Least Concern on the Red List in 2008 and it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment.</p>","<p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in a wide range of habitats from coastal to pelagic waters (Wells and Scott 1999). Where distinct ecotypes are known, the inshore form frequents estuaries, bays, lagoons and other shallow coastal regions, occasionally ranging far up into rivers. The offshore form tends to be less restricted in range and movement. Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins are residents around oceanic islands (Baird 2016). In many inshore areas Common Bottlenose Dolphins maintain definable, long-term, multi-generational home ranges, but in some locations near the extremes of the species’ range they are migratory. Off the coasts of North America, they tend to inhabit waters with surface temperatures ranging from about 10°C to 32°C (Wells and Scott, 1999). Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins are common over the shelf of this semi-enclosed basin; they sometimes occur far offshore (Birkun 2006).<br/> <br/> Common Bottlenose Dolphins are commonly associated with many other cetaceans, including large whales and other dolphin species (Wells and Scott 1999). Mixed schools with Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have been observed, for instance, in the Taiwan Strait (J. Wang pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> Bottlenose Dolphins consume a wide variety of prey species, mostly fish and squid (Barros and Odell 1990, Barros and Wells 1998, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2001, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2001). They sometimes eat shrimp and other crustaceans.</p>","<p>In many places Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in coastal waters, bringing them into contact with human activities. Conservation problems are known or suspected for at least: (a) the Critically Endangered Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation in New Zealand (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013), (b) the Endangered Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies (Birkun 2012), (c) the Vulnerable Mediterranean Sea subpopulation (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012), and the dolphins in (d) Sri Lanka (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989); (e) Peru, Ecuador, and Chile (Read <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1990, Sanino <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010); (f) Taiwan (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1999 pers. comm.); (g) Japan (Kasuya 2017) and (h) Gulf of California, Mexico (Segura-García <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Dolphin catches for bait, for human consumption, or to reduce competition with fisheries have been reported worldwide (Wells and Scott 1999, 2018). In a global review of the use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were among the most frequently used (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018). They were reported as being used for bait in Ghana, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela and Spain. In Peru, some coastal artisanal fisheries from at least one port take <em>Common Bottlenose Dolphins</em> for bait, using harpoons, while about 57% of Common Bottlenose Dolphins caught in gillnets as bycatch are discarded at sea; the extent to which such takes occur elsewhere along the Peruvian coast is not known (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species is taken opportunistically by harpoon in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). In Taiwan, Common Bottlenose Dolphins comprised a major part of the small cetaceans taken by harpoon in the past (J. Wang, pers. comm.). Although little evidence has been collected and reported since the 1990s, illegal hunting of cetaceans still occurs in Taiwan as evidenced by periodic news reports of police confiscations of cetacean parts. Directed hunting of cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, for local consumption occurs in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975) and in West Africa (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is reported to be one of several species targeted by hunters in Indonesia (Mustika 2006). <br/> <br/> The only Mediterranean area with quantitative historical information is the northern Adriatic Sea, where Common Bottlenose Dolphins likely have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, largely as a consequence of historical killing in extermination campaigns to reduce competition for fish, followed by habitat degradation and overfishing. The extermination campaigns were conducted until the early 1960s (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). For the northwestern Mediterranean, the available information suggests similar trends (Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). There continues to be substantial incidental mortality in fishing gear, and overfishing of dolphin prey, disturbance by marine traffic, and high levels of contamination by pollutants are of concern in much of the Mediterranean Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Drive hunts of small cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, exist in the Faroe Islands and Japan. Up to 308 are taken annually in the Faroe Islands drive hunt (dating back to 1803), often with Long-finned Pilot Whales (Reyes 1991, Bloch 1998). Drive and harpoon hunts in Japan catch Common Bottlenose Dolphins for human consumption and to remove perceived competition with commercial fisheries (Wells and Scott 1999, Kasuya 2017). Average catch from 1995–2004 was 594 per year (Kasuya 2017). Since 2000, the catch at Taiji in Japan has declined to fewer than 200 Common Bottlenose Dolphins per year, after a peak of 1,670 in 1987 (Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> The Endangered Black Sea subspecies was hunted extensively to obtain commercial products including oils, lubricants, food, meal, glue, and leather goods (Tomilin 1957, Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). An estimated 24,000 - 28,000 were taken in the Black Sea off Turkey during 1946–1983. However, the total number killed was certainly much greater (probably by tens of thousands) as these figures do not include, or only partially include, catch statistics from other Black Sea countries (Birkun 2006, 2012).<br/> <br/> The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is the most common cetacean species in captivity worldwide (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Live captures of Common Bottlenose Dolphins for public display, research, and military applications have occurred in several parts of the species' range. There is no worldwide estimate of the scale of these removals, but more than 1,500 were live-captured in United States, Mexican, and Bahamian waters through 1980 (Leatherwood and Reeves 1982, Fisher and Reeves 2005). Up to 1983 at least 198 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were reported to have been live-captured for European aquaria (Collet 1984). More recently, eight were collected illegally in the Dominican Republic in 2002 (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010) and live-capture efforts in Senegal in 2003 led to the death of at least five dolphins (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). At least 238 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were live-captured in Cuba in 1986–2004 (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2006), and 15 in the Solomon Islands in 2013 (Oremus <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins captured during drive hunts in Japan are collected alive for marine parks in Japan and internationally (Butterworth <em>et al</em>. 2013). The cumulative live-capture removals of Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins, not counting mortality during capture operations, is estimated to be from several hundred up to around 1,000 since the mid-1960s for military, academic, and display purposes, including swim-with-dolphins programs (Birkun 2002). Live-captures through 2002 took 10-20 animals annually from a small area in the Kerch Strait, Russia (Birkun 2002, 2006, 2012). According to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) statistics, at least 92 individuals were removed from the Black Sea region during 1990-1999 (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003), and Russia reportedly exported at least 66 for travelling shows from 1997-2005 (Fisher and Reeves 2005). <br/> <br/> Incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins is known to occur throughout the species’ range in set gillnets, drift gillnets, purse seines, trawls, and longlines, and on hook-and-line gear used in commercial and recreational fisheries, but the level of mortality is poorly documented from most range states (Wells and Scott 1999, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2008). Set gillnet, purse-seine and drift gillnet fisheries off Peru continue to take an unknown but potentially large number annually (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2017b, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2010), and some of those taken as bycatch or directly were being sold in fish markets at least through 2007, as determined by molecular evidence (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2010). Prior to 2001, the estimated annual incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery for tuna ranged up to almost 200 per year, but during 2001-2016, the average mortality declined to 2.9 per year (Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission data, M. Scott pers. comm.). Incidental catches in Chinese fisheries reached several hundred per year in the 1990s (Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999). Bottom trawls and sink gillnets in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. take on average 27 offshore Common Bottlenose Dolphins annually, pelagic longlines take 12 Common Bottlenose Dolphins on average each year (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and shrimp trawls take an unknown number each year (Greenman and McFee 2014). Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the third most frequently caught cetaceans in gillnets in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). Taiwanese coastal and distant-water longline fisheries for tunas and sharks take Common Bottlenose Dolphins incidentally, as do a variety of Taiwanese gillnet (including driftnets and trammel nets) and purse-seine fisheries in coastal and distant (e.g., Western Tropical Pacific) waters (Wang and Yang 2002, J. Wang pers. comm.). <br/> <br/> Annual Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets from 1946 through the 1980s was roughly estimated as being in the hundreds. The scale of this mortality almost certainly increased in the 1990s-2000s owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (Birkun 2006, 2012). According to Öztürk (1999) at least 200 Bottlenose Dolphins may have been taken incidentally per year in Turkish fisheries in a variety of fishing nets, especially bottom-set gill nets.&#160;</p>  <p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal areas are exposed to a wide variety of threats in addition to direct and incidental takes (Vollmer and Rosel 2013). Threats that are cause for concern include: 1) the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals; 2) reduced prey availability caused by environmental degradation and overfishing; 3) direct and indirect disturbance and harassment (e.g., boat traffic and commercial dolphin watching and interactive programs); 4) marine construction, including demolition, dredging, and land reclamation, and 5) other forms of habitat destruction and degradation (including anthropogenic noise). Although these and other threats are technically challenging to quantify by comparison with removals, their cumulative impact is likely to result in population declines. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to an increasing number of Unusual Mortality Events involving Common Bottlenose Dolphins remains to be determined (Spradlin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>The Critically Endangered Fiordland (New Zealand) Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation faces threats from boat-based tourism, increased freshwater discharge from hydroelectric power generation, and reduced prey availability from environmental degradation and overfishing (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Environmental contaminants likely impact health and reproductive success of the Common Bottlenose Dolphins in parts of its range. Lahvis <em>et al</em>. (1995) correlated concentrations of PCBs and DDT in the blood of inshore Bottlenose Dolphins with decline in immune system function. Males in some areas such as Florida accumulate levels of PCBs more than an order of magnitude greater than the threshold for adverse health effects identified by Kannan <em>et al</em>. (2000). A risk assessment relative to PCB burdens suggested elevated probabilities of first-born mortality at several sites in the U.S. (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005). Jepson <em>et al.</em> (2016) reported that Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Europe had mean PCB concentrations that greatly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The spatial patterns of PBDEs and the ΣDDTs/ΣPCBs detected in Common Bottlenose Dolphin blubber have been shown to vary significantly with adjacent watersheds and land use associations in the southeastern United States (Adams <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>The <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> oil spill in 2010 was one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the history of the United States. The oil spill adversely impacted the health, reproduction, and survival of Common Bottlenose Dolphins along much of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lane <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the stock in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, where oiling was heavy, the spill resulted in an estimated 30,347 lost cetacean years (the difference between baseline and injured population size, summed over the modeled time period) (95% CI: 11,511-89,746), and models suggested the time to recovery of the population would be 39 years (95% CI: 24 to 80) (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2017). Similar recovery timelines were predicted for other nearby stocks. There is concern that planned large-scale diversions of fresh water from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay may hamper the recovery of this stock.</p>  <p>&#160;Common Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes forage around fish-farm cages or take fish from gillnets (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001, Read <em>et al</em>. 2003), commercial trawling gear, crab traps, or recreational fishing gear (Wells and Scott 1999). This can result in incidental mortality through entanglement, hooking, and ingestion of gear (Powell and Wells 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016, Stolen <em>et al.</em> 2013). Common Bottlenose Dolphins conditioned to receive food items are more likely to be injured by human interactions than unconditioned dolphins, leading to decreased survival and potentially to consequences at the population level (Donaldson <em>et al</em>. 2010, Christiansen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Developments in recreational fishing line technology include microfilament braided twine that is more damaging to dolphin tissues than simple monofilament (Barco <em>et al</em>. 2010). Dredging and demolition associated with marine construction have been demonstrated to at least temporarily displace Common Bottlenose Dolphins from their normal range (Buckstaff <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pirotta <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Morbillivirus has been responsible for several documented epizootic events involving deaths of hundreds to thousands of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2011). During an outbreak along the U.S. Atlantic coast in 1987-88, more than 740 Common Bottlenose Dolphins died between New Jersey and Florida. During 2013-2015, more than 1,800 Common Bottlenose Dolphin carcasses were recovered during a morbillivirus event along the Atlantic coast from New York to Florida (NOAA/NMFS 2015). In each of these cases, it should be noted that only a fraction of the actual mortality is generally documented as stranded carcasses, so the number of deaths from the disease are likely much higher (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is not known if anthropogenic factors increase susceptibility to the disease.</p>","<p></p><p>Abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins has been estimated for several parts of the species' range. Summing available estimates, a minimum world-wide abundance estimate would be 750,000, acknowledging that most of the range of the species has not been surveyed for abundance estimation, and some of the estimates included in the summation are out of date.<br/> <br/> <a name=""_Hlk523388145"">Recent surveys by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017) have estimated 97,964 Bottlenose Dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico <strong>(</strong>5,806 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.39) in oceanic waters beyond the shelf edge, 51,192 (CV = 0.10) on the outer continental shelf, 39,734 in coastal waters, and 1,232 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. There are approximately 110,000 Common Bottlenose Dolphins off the east coast of North America (including 77,532 (CV = 0.40) in offshore waters, 31,212 in coastal waters, and 1,209 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. For both regions, current estimates are not available for most of the bays, sounds, and estuaries (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Recent stock assessment reports for U.S. Pacific waters indicated that there are 453 (CV = 0.06) Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal California waters, and 1,924 (CV = 0.54) in the offshore waters of California, Oregon, and Washington (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). These stock assessments include abundance estimates for individual stocks in Hawaiian waters: Kauai/Niihau, 147 (CV = 0.11), Oahu, 594 (CV = 0.54), 4-Islands, 153 (CV = 0.24), Hawaii Island, 102 (CV = 0.13), and Hawaii Pelagic, 5,590 (CV = 0.59) (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific resulted in an estimate of 243,500 (CV = 0.29) (Wade and Gerrodette 1993), but this estimate should be considered with caution given the fact that it is more than 25 years old. No recent abundance estimates for Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Japanese waters are available (Kasuya 2017). Japanese surveys prior to 1993 resulted in estimates of 168,000 (CV = 0.26) in the Northwestern Pacific west of 180ºE, including 36,791 (CV = 0.25) in Japanese coastal waters (Miyashita 1993). In the eastern Sulu Sea, Dolar <em>et al.</em> (2006) estimated 2,628 Common Bottlenose Dolphins 1994-1995 (CV = 0.40). </a></p>  <p>A large-scale survey (SCANS-III) of European Atlantic waters from the Strait of Gibraltar in the south to 62°N in the north and extending west to the 200 nm limits of most European Union Member State Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) was conducted in 2016 (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). The final surveyed area excluded offshore waters of Portugal and to the south and west of Ireland (surveyed by the Irish ObSERVE project), and included coastal waters of Norway north to Vestfjorden. In total, 27,700 (CV = 0.23) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). As part of the ObSERVE aerial surveys of the Irish EEZ, 8,700 km of line transect aerial surveys were conducted in Beaufort sea state ≤4 in both the summer (May-June 2016) and winter (November-February) of 2016/2017. There were clear seasonal differences in habitat use and abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins, which showed an approximate 2.5 fold increase in density during winter (0.626 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) compared to summer (0.257 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>). The summer abundance estimate was 87,330 (CV = 0.21) (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Scottish waters, abundance was estimated as 195 (95% highest posterior density intervals (HPDI): 162–253) from the Moray Firth to Fife and 45 (95% HPDI: 33–66) in the Hebrides, leading to the conclusion that 200-300 Common Bottlenose Dolphins inhabit the inshore coastal waters of Scotland (Cheney <em>et al</em>. 2013). A community of 420 dolphins (95% confidence interval (CI) = 331–521) was documented in the Normano-Breton Gulf of the English Channel (Louis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Photo-identification surveys of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Shannon Estuary of western Ireland in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 107 (CV = 0.12; 95% CI = 83 to 131)) (Berrow <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Total abundance for the Mediterranean Sea Common Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation, listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, is unknown but thought to be in the low 10,000’s and decreasing (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). Surveys of 86,000 km<sup>2</sup> of the northwestern Mediterranean off Spain in 2002 estimated 7,654 (CV = 0.45) Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on surveys in 2000-2003 an estimated 584 (CV = 0.28) individuals occur in the Alboran Sea of Spain (Cañadas and Hammond 2006). Abundance estimates for other parts of the Mediterranean Sea include 148 (95% CI = 132 to 180) in the Amvrakikos Gulf, western Greece (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008), 1,676 (95% CI = 804-3,492) in the Pelagos Sanctuary of the western Mediterranean (Lauriano <em>et al</em>. 2014), 517 (95% CI = 406-658) in the Balearic Islands (Gonzalvo <em>et al</em>. 2014), and 42 (95% CI = 42.0 to 43.1)<strong> </strong>off northeastern Tunisia (Benmessaoud <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline in the resident Common Bottlenose Dolphin population inhabiting the Kvarnerić area of the northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia during 1995-2003 appears to have been reversed, with about 200 individuals currently using the area (Pleslić <em>et al.</em> 2013). Bottlenose dolphins near Lampedusa Island, Italy, have increased significantly since 1998 to 249 (95% CI = 162 to 449) (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins exhibit subpopulation structure, based on behavior, toxicology, diet, and genetics (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2005, Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>The total population size of the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies, currently listed as Endangered, is unknown. However, there are abundance estimates for parts of the range suggesting that population size is at least several thousand individuals (Birkun 2006, 2012).</p>  <p>Off South America, 83 (95% CI = 73 to 112) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated in Bahía San Antonio, Argentina in 2006-2008 (Vermuelen and Cammareri 2009). Further to the south in Patagonia, in Golfo San José and adjacent areas, Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance has declined since the 1970s from at least 53 to 34 dolphins (CV = 0.20) and range shifts have been observed; the causes of these changes could not be conclusively determined (Coscarella <em>et al</em>. 2012). Investigations into possible short-term declines in Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance due to bycatch in Patos Lagoon, Brazil, found the population to be stable over the period 1998-2012, with an estimate in 2012 of 78 animals (95% CI = 70-86) (Fruet <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015). &#160;</p>  <p>Off New Zealand, the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation is listed as Critically Endangered, with only 205 (95% CI: 192-219) individuals in 2008, of which 123 were mature (Currey <em>et al. </em>2009). Elsewhere in New Zealand, there are an estimated 211 Common Bottlenose Dolphins (95% CI = 195 to 232) in the Marlborough Sounds (Merriman <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 92 (95% CI = 80 to 111) near Stewart Island (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015). Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand showed a 7.5% annual rate of decline from 1997-1999 to 2003-2006 (Tezanos-Pinto <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Around the island of São Tomé, off the west coast of Africa, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the most commonly sighted cetaceans during a total of 226 surveys between 2002 and 2006, and in 2012. In total, 140 individuals were photo-identified, and the high rate of discovery of new individuals suggested that these were part of a much larger population (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2011-2013, during 13,694 km of visual survey transects in continental shelf and slope waters off Northwest Africa, between Tangier and Conakry<em>, T. truncatus</em> were (after the Common Dolphin <em>Delphinus delphis</em>) the second-most frequently encountered cetaceans, accounting for 9.6% of total sightings (Djiba <em>et al.</em> 2015). In offshore waters of the Western Indian Ocean, Bottlenose Dolphins, the majority of which appeared to be <em>T. truncatus</em>, were among the most common cetaceans observed (Ballance and Pitman 1998).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"Common Bottlenose Dolphins occur worldwide through tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1990, Wells and Scott 1999, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2000). They range poleward of 45° in northern Europe (as far as the Faroe Islands 62°N 7°W; Bloch and Mikkelsen 2000) and southern New Zealand (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the species was recently reported as far south as 53-55<sup>o</sup>S in South America (Olavarría <em>et al</em>. 2010, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the eastern Pacific they have been seen as far north as British Columbia (50<sup>o</sup>N) but their typical range is up to 41<sup>o</sup>N (Halpin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Common Bottlenose Dolphins are rare in the Baltic Sea (best considered extralimital there) and are vagrant to Newfoundland and Norway (Wells and Scott 1999). They occur regularly in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the Arabian Sea (Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 1999).","<p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins are hunted in some areas (St. Vincent, Sri Lanka, Japan, Indonesia, West Africa) for human consumption, and as bait in fisheries. In addition, Common Bottlenose Dolphins are sometimes removed from the wild and maintained under human care for public display, research, and training to support specific military and civilian functions at sea. They are increasingly the objects of dolphin watching (tourism) activities.</p>",Marine,"<p>The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans including Bottlenose Dolphins was banned in 1966 in the former USSR, Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey.

This is compounded by the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within two or arguably three generations time, that derivatives of this species are used in traditional medicine in China, both legally and illegally, and being promoted as a means of economic growth in the country and along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which could increase demand for the species and its parts, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest.<br/><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/>Currently, only Hong Kong and Taiwan, and potentially Bhutan, are parts of the range where overexploitation is not thought to be a threat to the species.","<p>This species is found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary tropical forests, limestone, bamboo, broad-leaf and coniferous forests, grasslands and agricultural fields (Chao 1989, Gurung 1996). The species digs its own burrows, or enlarges passages made by termites (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005. Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Mro hunters in Bangladesh reported that a pangolin can excavate up to 15 burrows in a single night (presumably feeding burrows) and that resident burrows can extend up to 10m deep (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). This study also revealed that like the Indian Pangolin, the Chinese Pangolin will create an earthen wall once in a resident burrow which likely aids in predator avoidance (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Indications are that home ranges are relatively large. In Taitung, Taiwan, the home range of a male was estimated 96.0 ha (100% MCP) or 66.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel; n = 1) and 14.3-30.3 ha (100% MCP) or 15.9~19.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel) for females (n = 6) (Lin, 2011) </p>  <p>The Chinese Pangolin is solitary, primarily nocturnal (sometimes crepuscular), and largely terrestrial although it is fully capable of climbing trees and, like other pangolins, swims well (Heath and Vanderlip 1988; Chao 1989). Little is known about the species' life history, although in China (including Taiwan [Province of China]), young (normally one and occasionally two) are reportedly born from August to February (Allen and Coolidge 1940, Liu and Xu 1981, Shi and Wang 1985, Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al.</em> 1993, Chin<em> et al.</em> 2011). Hunters in Viet Nam reported that they never find this species in trees and it seems likely that it is far more terrestrial than the more arboreal Sunda Pangolin (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>Lin (2011) reported that there are two type of burrows that Chinese Pangolin use, namely feeding burrows and resident burrows. Feeding burrows are created by feeding on subterranean termites and are mainly used once. Lin found no statistically significant difference between the frequency of forest and more open habitats. Resident burrows are used for shelter and resting and sleep. A male pangolin can occupy ~80 resident burrows in its home range and a female has ~30-40 resident burrows. Different individuals may use the same resting burrow but very rarely on the same day.</p>  <p>Sun <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported the nursing period of the wild Chinese Pangolin was 157 days. The infant pangolin was observed exiting the nursing burrow alone at 11 weeks old and exploring behaviors such as s soil scraping and licking were recorded. In addition, the exploring behaviours were observe while the mother had left the burrow. The growth rate of was estimated at a constant rate of 1.2 cm/week during the nursing period, which was much faster than the only record from a hand-reared individual (0.7 cm/week; see Sun <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>  <p>The diet consists of ants and termites and it has been noted that in China, there appears to be a close correlation between the Chinese Pangolin's distribution and that of two termite species (<em>Coptotermes formosanus</em> and <em>Termes</em> (<em>Cyclotermes</em>) <em>formosanus</em>) which are assumed to form a major component of the diet (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Individuals are prey selective but known prey species include <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes, Camponotus mitis, C. nicobarensis, C. variegatus dulcis, Polyrhachis demangei, Aphaenogaster exasperata, Crematogaster dohrni</em>, and termite species <em>Macrotermes barneyi</em> : this is based on analysis of stomach contents (see Lee <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p><br/></p>","The primary threat is indiscriminate hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use, with the latter primarily driven by demand in China, and the species is subject to very heavy collection pressure across much of its range (Wu and Ma 2007, Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). As has occurred historically, exploitation for nutritional, medicinal and spiritualistic purposes takes place locally (Anon 1999, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017, D'Cruze et al. 2018). However, evidence suggests that local use is now frequently forgone in favour of entering animals into national and international trade given their high financial value (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, MacMillan and Nguyen 2014). International use involves trafficking of the species and its derivatives despite the species being included in Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated that between 2000 and 2013 international trafficking in this species potentially involved ~50,000 individuals, though the actual number between 2000 and 2018 is higher (see Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In China and Viet Nam, the meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat for which affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in traditional medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Other threats include infrastructure development, habitat loss and fragmentation, and pesticide use. In China, major developments including hydropower stations and mining also pose a threat.<br/>Taiwan and Hong Kong are exceptions where populations are not threatened by heavy hunting or poaching. The threats here include predation by feral dogs, roadkill and development, i.e. conversion of land for human use. In Taiwan, research suggests that Chinese Pangolins can become trapped in burrows or tree hollows, and is a cause of mortality, as is their capture in gin traps (Sun<em> et al.</em> 2019).<strong></strong><em></em>","<p>There is very little information available on population levels at any level (local, national or global) with few exceptions, and there is a paucity of research on abundance. This species is rarely observed, principally due to its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, solitary and primarily nocturnal. Evidence indicates it has been extirpated from parts of its current range as a result of over-exploitation, and is otherwise in steep decline across most of its range (Zhang 2008, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al</em>. 2017). An exception is Taiwan where populations are suspected to be stable and potentially increasing.&#160;</p><p>China comprises the largest range state for this species, but populations have suffered severe declines in recent decades. Between the 1960-1980s up to 160,000 Chinese Pangolins were harvested annually in China for consumptive use resulting in all but the commercial extinction of the species by the 1990s (SATCM 1996, Zhang 2008). We <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that populations declined by 88-94% between the 1960s and 1990s. In 2002, Wu <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated populations in China to comprise 50,000-100,000 individuals, and in 2008 China’s then National Forestry Administration (NFA; though now National Forestry and Grassland Administration [NFGA]) estimated the national population to comprise 64,000 individuals. In contrast, Zhang<em> et al.</em> (2010) estimated the population in China in 2008 to comprise between 25,100 and 49,450 individuals. Also in 2008, the NFA (2008) estimated the population of Guangxi Province at 990 individuals with a density of 0.043 individuals/km². Interviews as part of research in China in recent years indicate this species is present but very rare in the border areas of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces (P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data), but at some sites (e.g., Dawuling Natural Reserve and Luofushan Natural Reserve), new burrows have not been seen in approaching twenty years indicating extirpation, and it is suspected that the species has been extirpated from Jiangsu, Henan and Shanghai Provinces (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2015 and 2016, more than 20 natural reserves were surveyed in southern China, but found no fresh burrows or live individuals (F. Zhang and Q. Wang, unpubl. data). Li et al. (2018) estimated that in eastern China (Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces) the species’ range contracted by 52% between 1970s and 2000s, and populations are now largely confined to the Wuyi Mountains. On Hainan Island, extensive field research between 1997 and 2013 and interviews with hunters and local people indicate the species is of very low abundance and likely commercially extinct (Nash <em>et al. </em>2016, P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data). In Hong Kong SAR, the species is present but is considered rare (G. Ades, pers. comm).<br/></p><p>In Taiwan (P.R. China) reports from the late 1980s and early 1990s suggest that populations of the nominal subspecies, the Formosan Pangolin were decreasing due to overexploitation from hunting and populations are were greatly reduced (Chao&#160; 1989, Chao <em>et al. </em>2005). After the Taiwanese government established the Wildlife Conservation Act in 1989 it appears that domestic consumption was significantly reduced. Evidence suggests populations are stable if not increasing in Taiwan and poaching is no longer the main threat. In southern Taiwan Pei (2010) estimated densities of 12-13 individuals/km². Kao <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated very approximately that the meta-population in Taiwan may comprise 15,000 individuals - though this estimate should be treated with extreme caution given significant knowledge gaps in parameters used to inform the models used to produce this estimate.</p><p>The species is very rare in Viet Nam. There are records from the past three decades from various protected areas, including Ba Na NP (Frontier Viet Nam, 1994), Cuc Phuong NP, Khe Net Nature Reserve and in Ke Go Nature Reserve (see Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). However, hunters in three areas of Viet Nam reported that although they still find the Chinese Pangolin it is extremely rare and populations have declined dramatically in the last two decades (i.e. in the 1990s and 2000s; see Newton <em>et al. </em>2008). In Khe Net and Ke Go, hunters reported that numbers of Chinese Pangolins were lower than those of the Sunda Pangolin probably because the former is easier to capture. If this is the case, then in places where both species occur, populations of the former are likely to be more heavily depleted (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008).</p><p>The species has been so heavily hunted in Lao PDR that field sightings are exceptionally rare. There were field sightings of an individual in Nam Theun Extension PNBCA (Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area) in 1994-1995, and an individual was seen in a village in Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA during the same period (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There are unverified camera trap records from Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA in the early 2010s (Coudrat, 2017).<br/></p>  <p>In Bangladesh, Chinese Pangolins in the southeast may have disappeared (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), however, there are still a few areas where they exist, such as within the Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is an absence of high-skilled hunters (Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017). In this area, there was consensus among hunters interviewed that populations in the south has been extirpated as a result of overexploitation from poaching since 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Populations in Bangladesh are suspected to be declining.</p>  <p>This species was reported in the 1980s as common in the undisturbed hill forests of Arunachal Pradesh, however, little is known about the total population in India (Tikader 1983, Zoological Survey of India 1994). However, trafficking figures suggest this species is under severe hunting pressure in Northeast India (Misra and Hanfee 2000, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/></p><p>Surveys conducted in the Royal Nagarjung Forest in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the early 1990s determined that there was a healthy population there (Gurung 1996). Nepal's population has been loosely estimated at 5,000 individuals but is suspected to be declining as a result of overexploitation (Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p><p>There is little information on the status of the species in Thailand and Myanmar. There is a potential record from Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar form post-2000 (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, southern Bhutan, north and northeastern India, northeast, northwest and southeastern Bangladesh, northern and western Myanmar, to northern and Annamite regions of Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, part of northwestern Thailand, and across southern China. In China it occurs south of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) and on Hainan, Taiwan (P.R. China) and Hong Kong SAR. The species has likely been extirpated from parts of its current range, the limits of which are poorly known and may never be elucidated, due to high levels of exploitation historically. However, Taiwanese pangolin populations have stabilized in the last two decades and may even be increasing. The species occurs at high altitudes, especially in the southern and western parts of its range. In Nepal it has been recorded up to 3,000 m asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data), though also occurs at much lower altitudes, for example in Hong Kong and likely in the northeast of its range. Its latitudinal range is thought to overlap considerably with that of the Sunda Pangolin <em>Manis javanica</em>. Where this is apparent it is hypothesized that the Chinese Pangolin occurs in hills and mountains and the former is more generally found at lower altitudes (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Viet Nam interviews with hunters in 2007 (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008) suggested that the two species can be found in the same areas of forest, and that the differences between them are ecological, relating to diet and habitat use, rather than altitude, but ecological differences between the species have yet to be fully elucidated. <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>In China the species' distribution extends from the southern border as far north as the Changjiang, including on the island of Zhoushan at the mouth of the Changjiang (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Its distribution extends to the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Huibei, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Fujian, and in the Autonomous Regions of Guangxi Zhuang, Tibet, and Hainan Island. Zhai (2000) suggest the species occurs in Xichuan county of Henan province, which would be the only record north of the Changjiang, but they provide little detail and this requires verification. In Hong Kong, the species has been recorded from the central and northeast New Territories and Lantau Island, but not on the smaller outlying islands (Shek <em>et al.</em> 2007); it occurs here at low altitudes (Reels 1996). In Taiwan (P.R. China), the species occurs on the periphery of the Central Mountain Range, the Western Foothill Range, the Taoyuan Tableland, the Ouluanpi Tableland, the East Coast Mountain Range, the Tatun Volcano Group, Taipei Basin, Puli Basin, and the Pingtun Plain (Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al</em>. 2005). The upper limit of occurrence in Taiwan is around 2,000 m asl (Chao 1989).</p><p>Beyond China, the species is distributed in northern and central Vietnam, from Ha Giang province as far south as Quang Tri Province, but is absent from the northeast coast (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is found in Cuc Phuong National Park, Khe Net Nature Reserve, and Ke Go Nature Reserve, and Ba Na National Park (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Lao PDR, the species has been recorded in the north and central parts, but there are too few locality records to determine the geographic and altitudinal range of the species in the country with any accuracy (Timmins and Evans 1996; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species is plausibly widespread in northern Myanmar, although there are few records and its exact distribution is not well known (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992). There is a record from Karen State in the early 2010s (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) report a sighting of the Sunda Pangolin in Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar, but there is uncertainty over the species' identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and it is plausibly and perhaps more likely the Chinese pangolin. There are few records from Thailand but include those from Doi Inthanon (formerly Doi Angka) in Changwat, Chiang Mai (northern Thailand), sometime in 1937 and 1939 (Allen and Coolidge 1940) and Doi Sutep, Chiangmai (northern Thailand) in 1901.</p>  <p>In Bangladesh, the species occurs in northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of the country, including in the border areas with northwestern Myanmar and India’s Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram states. Two Chinese Pangolins were captured from northwestern Bangladesh in recent years but which is thought to be the result of flash flooding from India. The species has reportedly been extirpated from most protected areas in southeastern Bangladesh. However, it does occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (southeast), Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (northeast), and Thakurgao (northwest) but has been extirpated from some areas due to poaching since around 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Bangladesh, it may be restricted to the India-Bangladesh border area only (Trageser<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p>The species is marginally present in northern India e.g. Vamiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are photographic records of the species in Bihar and it has been recorded in northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Sikkim and the northern part of West Bengal) (Tikader 1983, Zoological Society of India 2002, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). Chinese Pangolins also exist in Kaziranga-Karbi-Anglong landscape and Manas-Bhutan landscape and there are recent (post-2015) camera trap records from Manas National Park, India (D. Lahkar, unpubl. data), and reports of the species being present near Sirohi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bunning Wildlife Sanctuary and Yangoupokpi-Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary of Manipur, India (J. Sethy, unpubl. data). The species appears to be sympatric with the Indian Pangolin (<em>M. crassicaudata</em>)<em> </em>in the Neora Valley National Park (Mallick 2010) and Manas National Park (Lahkhar <em>et al.</em> 2018; Goswami and Ganesh 2014).</p>  <p>The species occurs in southern Bhutan (though potentially central and western areas only) and Nepal, where it is typically located between 555-1740 m Asl, though there are records from 3000m Asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data). A nation-wide survey of pangolins (see DNPWC and DOF 2018) in Nepal unveiled the occurrence of Chinese Pangolin throughout Nepal largely distributed in human dominated landscapes outside the protected areas, though it does occur in protected areas as well. This suggests that Chinese Pangolins are distributed across eastern, central and mid-western Nepal and the Mid hills of central Nepal harbors likely strongholds for the species. It has been recorded as present in the lower elevation belt of the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, the Gaurishankar and Annapurna Conservation Areas, Makalubarun, Sagarmatha, Chitwan, Parsa and Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Parks, the Salyan district in western Nepal (Khatiwada <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160; It has been also recorded in the Suklaphanta NP in southwest Nepal within the last four years and in Jajarkot district in mid-west Nepal (H.S. Baral, unpubl. data). In Nepal, its distribution appears to overlap with the Indian pangolin in the south and west. The Chinese Pangolin occurs from Inner Terai to hills and mountains while the Indian Pangolin is confined to lower altitudes; however, ecological differences between are not fully understood. &#160;</p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup>","<p>This species has been hunted at a local level historically, both for the consumption of its meat as a protein source, and for its scales for use as an ingredient in traditional medicines among other spiritual and ritualistic uses (Anon 1992, Zhang 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). It has also been subject to international trade historically. Based on trade data from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, this has principally involved scales&#160;or traditional medicines containing scales, as well as skins between the 1970s and the year 2000 (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015; Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016). However, following population declines in China up to the mid-1990s (see Zhang 2008), a heavy unrecorded and seemingly illicit international trade in live pangolins has occurred between Southeast Asia and China since which has involved this species (Li and Li 1998,&#160;Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught specimens of this species traded for commercial purposes. Despite this, illegal trade has continued post-2000 which is largely driven by market demand in China and mainly involves live animals and scales originating from Southeast and South Asia based on available evidence (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman, 2017). Trade in this species in particular appears to come from Myanmar (Challender and Waterman 2017). Although local use of pangolins also continues today, evidence suggests that this is often forgone in favour of selling the animals into trade, which is primarily destined to China (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; </p>  <p>In China, as well as Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat dish for which affluent consumers are willing to pay very high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers, as in Viet Nam. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>Other consumer countries include the United States which imported large quantities of derivatives including the Chinese Pangolin between 1985 and 20111 based on CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017).</p><p>There is ongoing local use across the species' range though quantifying this across the species' range is challenging. In Bangladesh, tribal communities believe that the use of pangolin meat can reduce their illness and the scales can keep away evil spirits. Local physicians also sell the scales by promoting their supposed supernatural medicine value, occasionally in cities. Trade routes exist between Bangladesh and Myanmar and pangolins are trafficked along these routes, mainly destined to China. In Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal, scales are worshipped as an incarnation of God during Tihar festival and are kept in homes to avoid evil spirits (P. Kaspal, unpubl. data). In Nepal, jhakris, local traditional healers have been using the pangolin for its supposed medicinal benefits for generations, but it is only recently that a booming trade has developed around the species which is threatening the specie. The species continues to be exploited locally for consumptive use in China (Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016), Viet Nam (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008), Bangladesh (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), northeastern India (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018) and Nepal&#160;</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The species is present in a number of protected areas across its range including in Bangladesh:&#160;Chittagong Hill Tracts, Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017); China: Dawuling Natural Reserve; India: Vamiki Tiger Reserve (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018), Manas National Park (D.

There are older records from Lao PDR - Nam Theun Extension Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NCBA) and Nakai-Nam Theun NCBA (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999), and a dated record from Doi Inthanon National Park, Thailand.&#160;</p><p>Whilst the Chinese Pangolin is protected by national legislation in virtually all range states there and is included in CITES Appendix I, there remains a need to ensure effective enforcement and judicial proceedings in range states where hunting and poaching, trafficking and trade occur (Challender and Waterman 2017).
