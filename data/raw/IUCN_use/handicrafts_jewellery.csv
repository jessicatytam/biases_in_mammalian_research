3163374,10103,Hippopotamus amphibius,Regionally Extinct,,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The hippopotamus is Regionally Extinct in the Mediterranean region. It was already rare in Egypt by the time of the Renaissance. From the end of the Roman Empire up until towards 1700 at the latest the hippo was still present in two well disjunct zones in the Nile Delta and in the upper Nile. Through the 1700s records become increasingly scarce, and the latest definite records are from the early 1800s&#160; (Manlius 2000).</p>","As its name suggests, the Common Hippopotamus is an amphibious creature, which spends the day in water and emerges at night to feed. The hippopotamus uses the water only as a retreat and it does not eat aquatic vegetation to any extent. Open water is not essential and the animal can survive in muddy wallows but it must have access to permanent water to which it can return in the dry season. The essential factor is that the skin must remain moist for it will crack if exposed to the air for long periods. The skin physiology is complex and not fully understood but is clearly adapted for an amphibious existence. A curious feature is the red secretion from modified sweat glands, which is thought to have an antibiotic function. <br/><br/>The water body must be large enough to accommodate a number of animals for the Common Hippo is highly gregarious when resting by day. The social habits of the species have been studied by Klingel (1991), who found that the ""schools"" are unstable groups of females and bachelors. The social system is based on mating territoriality. Common Hippos are gregarious, social, polygymous animals. Females become sexually mature between the ages of 7-9, and males 9-11. Females typically bear a single offspring every other year as lactation can extend for 18 months. Territorial males monopolize a length of the shoreline of the river or lake but tolerate bachelors within the territory provided they behave submissively. Non-breeding males also settle outside territorial areas, especially seasonal wallows. Fights for the possession of a territory can be fierce and the animals may inflict considerable damage on each other with their huge canines but minor conflicts are usually settled by threat displays, of which the ""yawn"" is the most conspicuous. Territorial males do not normally fight each other and severe fights usually occur only when a bachelor challenges a territorial male for control of its territory. There is little association between animals when they are feeding at night, except between females and their dependent young, and the males do not then behave in a territorial fashion. <br/><br/>The male Common Hippopotamus, rarely the female, spreads its dung by wagging its tail vigorously while defecating, both in the water and on land, where it is thought to have a signalling rather than a territorial function. The dung piles may serve for orientation. <br/><br/>Vocalizations take the form of complex bellows and grunts, which presumably have a signalling function. Sounds may be made either on land or in the water and may be transmitted simultaneously through air and water. This is the only known case of amphibious calls in a mammal.<br/><br/>It is probable that the need to avoid the direct rays of the sun has determined the nocturnal feeding habits of the animal. It leaves its wallow soon after sunset and spends the night grazing on short grass swards for up to several kilometres from water. These swards, which are kept short by the activities of the hippopotamus, are known as hippo lawns. Although the hippopotamus grazes every night, except for mothers with very young calves, there are usually animals present in the water all night, as some return after a few hours and others leave later. The animal feeds by plucking the grass with its wide, muscular lips and passing it to the back of the mouth to be ground up by the molars. The front teeth (incisors and canines) play no part in feeding. The amount of food ingested is small relative to the size of the animal but its resting habits by day reduce its energetic demands. The stomach is a complex four-chambered structure with a ruminant type digestion although the animal does not chew the cud.<br/><br/>The ecological requirements for hippopotamus, therefore, include a supply of permanent water, large enough for the territorial males to spread out, and adequate grazing on open grassland within a few kilometres of the daytime resting sites.","The primary threats to Common Hippos are illegal and unregulated hunting for meat and ivory (found in the canine teeth) and habitat loss. Illegal or unregulated hunting of Common Hippos has been found to be particularly high in areas of civil unrest (Kayanja 1989; Shoumatoff 2000; Hillman Smith <em>et al.</em> 2003). A recent field survey found that Common Hippo populations in DR Congo have declined more than 95% as a result of intense hunting pressure, during more than eight years of civil unrest and fighting (Hillman Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003). Widespread poaching for meat has also been reported from Burundi and Ivory Coast (Associated Press 2003; H. Rainey pers. comm.). In many countries were Common Hippos are found, populations are not confined to protected areas; some of these unprotected areas are included in Table 1 (see supplementary material). Although it is likely that the majority of the total Common Hippo population occurs in some form of protected area (national park, biosphere, game or forest reserve, sanctuary, conservation area), the proportion of protected Common Hippos likely varies among countries. For countries with a high proportion of Common Hippo populations outside protected areas, the likelihood of persistence is much lower as there is no impediment to hunting or incentive for habitat protection.<br/><br/>Estimates of the amount of Common Hippo ivory illegally exported have also increased. A 1994 assessment by TRAFFIC, the monitoring agency of international trade for the IUCN, reported that illegal trade in hippo ivory increased sharply following the international elephant ivory ban in 1989. Between 1991-1992, approximately 27,000 kg of hippo canine teeth were exported, an increase of 15,000 kg from 1989-1990 estimates (Weiler <em>et al</em>. 1994). In 1997, more than 1,700 hippo teeth en route from Uganda to Hong Kong were seized by customs officials in France (TRAFFIC 1997). Five thousand kilos of hippo teeth (from an estimated 2,000 hippos) of unknown origins were exported from Uganda in 2002 (New Vision 2002).<br/><br/>Common Hippo's reliance on fresh water habitats appears to put them at odds with human populations and adds to their vulnerability, given the growing pressure on fresh water resources across Africa (WWC 2004). Habitat loss stems from water diversion related to agricultural development (Cole 1992; Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993; Viljoen 1995; Viljoen and Biggs 1998) as well as larger-scale development in and around wetland areas (Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993). Reports of human mortalities from Common Hippo interactions have also increased in recent years. Ten countries reported growing numbers of hippo-human conflicts, in several cases exacerbated by drought conditions.<br/><br/>Although there are several ongoing research projects in captive facilities and with wild populations, little research has focused directly on common hippo conservation. Mwanika <em>et al</em>. (2003) considered the genetic consequences of the intense unregulated hunting that occurred in Uganda in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on both nuclear and mitochondrial data, they conclude that although populations were reduced to 70% of initial population size, their current levels of genetic diversity are substantial and not a cause for concern. This suggests that for some populations, once the hunting disturbance is removed, recovery from intense hunting is likely and may not result in detrimental long-term population effects.<br/><br/>Lewison (2007) evaluates the relative impacts of the known threats to persistence - habitat loss (from agricultural or larger-scale development) and hunting pressure - on a model population. While accounting for rainfall variability and demographic stochasticity, the model results suggest that combinations of habitat loss and even moderate levels of adult mortality from hunting (1% of adults) can lead to a relatively high probabilities of population declines over the next 30-40 years.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for Table 1: country information including population status, trend, etc.","There are clear regional differences in population size and distribution. Eastern African countries (including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia) form the conservation stronghold for this species and are where the largest numbers of Common Hippos occur. Although common hippos are found in many West African nations, overall population sizes tend to be much smaller, either because of less available habitat or the higher density of human populations. Populations appear to be decreasing in many countries. The largest populations are found in East Africa. A country-by-country assessment conducted in 1993-1994 found that there were approximately 160,000 Common Hippos across their range, although this was considered to be an overestimate. A more recent assessment suggests that there are likely between 125,000 and 148,000 Common Hippos remaining. In contrast with the 1994 estimate, this range is not likely to underestimate the populations size. Of the 29 countries in which Common Hippos are found, confirmed population declines have been reported in half. The largest declines have occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country once thought to have the largest populations.<br/><br/><strong>Western Africa</strong><br/>The species is not common in West Africa and the population is split into a number of small groups totalling about 7,000 spread over 19 countries. Populations most at risk are those in West Africa, where the distribution is particularly fragmented. <br/><br/>Hippopotamus are absent from the rain forests except near large rivers. They are most abundant in estuarine habitats and on the lower reaches of rivers. Some are found in the sea in the Archipelago of Bijagos off Guinea Bissau. Guinea, Guinea Bissau and Senegal probably contain the bulk of the West African Common Hippopotamus, with total numbers likely to be in the region of a few thousand. Although small in area, Guinea Bissau supports a substantial population, which is particularly abundant on the islands of the Bijagos Archipelago and along the numerous inland rivers. The species is common on most of the rivers in Guinea and in the east and south of Senegal with an estimated country-wide population of between 500 and 700. The Gambia contains no more than about 40 animals. There are probably less than 200 in Sierra Leone or Mali and none at all in Liberia or Mauritania.<br/><br/>The group of contiguous countries, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Burkina Faso, contain a total of, at most, two thousand Common Hippopotamus with the majority in Burkina Faso. There have been no recent counts except on the Comoe River on the border with the Côte d'Ivoire, where 720 were recorded in 1989. A further group is found on the Pendjari River system bordering Benin. This numbered about 500 in 1979 but only some 280 remained in 1987. The Mono River between Benin and Togo supported a small but stable population of 53 in 1986. Only remnant populations remain in Ghana. <br/><br/>Nigeria and Niger between them contain at least 400. No recent information was obtained for Chad but according to Sidney (1965) the species was common in the vicinity of Lake Chad during the 1950s. Common Hippopotamus were also once numerous in Cameroon but the only information obtained during the present survey was from the Korup National Park, where signs of the species are common around the confluence of the Miri and Bake Rivers although sightings are few. It is likely that the species does not occur in the Bake River much further upstream than Bajo although some traces were found as far up as Bakut. At least 150 Common Hippopotamus (possibly as many as 1,500) are known to exist in the Central African Republic in addition to an unknown number in Bamimgui-Bangoran National Park, where 136 were counted in 1973 although now there are probably only 20 to 30 present. Common Hippopotamus occur along most of the coastline of Gabon and for a considerable distance up the Ogooue River and although there are no recent estimates of numbers, they are said to be abundant in places. A few are found in neighbouring Equatorial Guinea on the Campo River. No counts have been made in the Congo, but the species is reported by one correspondent to be widely distributed and numerous on suitable rivers but another reports its presence on only one, the Nyanga River. The entry for the Congo in the IUCN Directory (IUCN/UNEP, 1987) lists Odzala National Park, Lefini Reserve (Louna and Lesio Rivers), and Nyanga North Reserve as containing hippopotamus. Zaire will be considered with East Africa as most of the hippopotamus are in the east of the country.<br/><br/>The total number of Common Hippopotamus in the nineteen west African countries considered here cannot be assessed with any accuracy because of the absence of recent counts but the figure is likely to be in the region of 7,000.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Africa</strong><br/>East Africa holds substantial numbers with 30,000 in eastern DR Congo and populations numbering tens of thousands in Ethiopia, Sudan and Tanzania. Several thousand also occur in Kenya and Uganda bringing the total for East Africa as a whole to about 70,000.<br/><br/>Many of the Common Hippopotamus in Africa are found in the east, especially in Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and DR Congo. The Common Hippopotamus occurs in the southern Sudan on the Rivers Nile, Sobat and Jur south of Malakal and in several national parks and reserves. Other localities include the Sudd and tributaries of the Nile. There is no information on population sizes but it is said to occur in good numbers in most places. The species is also abundant between altitudes of 200 and 2,000 m in neighbouring Ethiopia, where its main strongholds appear to be the Omo, Awash and Great Abbi (Blue Nile) Rivers. It also occurs in most of the larger lakes and as isolated populations in smaller swamps and pools. The few that occur in the dry south-east are confined to the Webi, Shebeli and Ganale Rivers. The northern limit of the species is the Setit River. No precise counts have been made recently but the Common Hippopotamus is said to be numerous throughout its range. The total for the two countries combined is probably to be numbered in tens of thousands. Very few animals remain in neighbouring Somalia although some small groups have been reported on the lower Shebeli River and along the Juba River, where they are rather more numerous. No Common Hippopotamus have been reported from Djibouti.<br/><br/>The species occurs in most of the many suitable habitats throughout Kenya and some recent counts have been made in the Mara River area (2,132 in 1980), Lake Naivasha (220 in 1988) and along part of the Tana River between Osako and Adamson's Falls (220 in 1983) (Coe and Collins 1986, Karstad <em>et al.</em> 1980, Smart, in litt). The Mara figure includes some from over the border in Tanzania. Elsewhere in Tanzania, Common Hippopotamus are common in the Selous Game Reserve, where 1,894 were counted on 115 km of the River Rufigi in 1987 (Samuels, in litt). An estimate for the total population of the Selous in 1986 was 16,900 (with a standard error 6,307) from an aerial sample count made by I. Douglas-Hamilton. Independent aerial counts in the Selous reported by Games (1990) returned figure of 15,483 in 1986, 24,169 in 1989 and 20,589 in 1990. The last total is a rather crude extrapolation from an observed figure of 6,866. A large population occurs on the Akagera River and associated lakes on the border between Tanzania and Rwanda, but no recent count has been made. The total counted from the air in 1969 was 671 (Spinage <em>et al.</em> 1972). Common Hippopotamus are found in most other national parks and reserves of Tanzania and although not present anywhere in large numbers, the total probably amounts to several thousand more. <br/><br/>The principal concentrations of the species in Uganda are in the two large national parks, Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth. At one time the population in the latter park reached 21,000, but this was reduced to about 14,000 in the culling programme of the 1950s. Counts in the early 1970s returned about 11,000 but heavy poaching during the Amin years had left only a couple of thousand by 1989 when 2,172 were estimated from an aerial sample count. Similar numbers were found in the Murchison Falls National Park in the past but there, too, heavy poaching has reduced the population to remnant numbers although a recent count has not been made. The latest appears to have been in 1980 when 1,202 were recorded on the Nile between the falls and Paraa Lodge. The total for the whole park is probably about the same as in Queen Elizabeth National Park i.e., a few thousand. Other regions in Uganda where substantial numbers of hippopotamus occurred include the Semliki River and lakes Victoria and Kyoga. An educated guess of about 7,000 for the present total population of hippopotamus in the whole country is probably not far wrong.<br/><br/>Common Hippopotamus have a wide distribution in DR Congo including some in the north-west of the country although the bulk is in the east, where they occur around Epulu and Wamba and along some of the larger rivers in the Ituri Forest. Other populations occur on the Zaire River (Yangabi), Bomu River and elsewhere in several national parks including Garamba, Kundelungu, Salonga, Upemba and Virunga. The latter contains the greatest concentration with a total of 22,875 estimated from a 1988 aerial count made by C. Mackie, who with K. Hillman Smith also recorded 2,851 in Garamba National Park in 1988. In round figures, these counts suggest a total of some 26,000 Common Hippopotamus for the two parks. Numbers elsewhere in DR Congo probably do not amount to more than a few thousand, perhaps bringing the country-wide total up to about 30,000.<br/><br/>There are not many Common Hippopotamus in the remaining East African countries of Rwanda and Burundi. Numbers on the Akagera River have been mentioned above in the section on Tanzania and there are probably still a few in wallows within the Akagera National Park or Mutara Game Reserve but no recent information has been received. Common Hippopotamus occur in Burundi on the Malagarazi, Ruvubu and Rusizi Rivers but there are conflicting reports over numbers. P. Chardonnet reports good populations numbered in hundreds and P. C. Trenchard puts the total on these rivers as over 1,000 as a conservative estimate. K. M. Doyle, however, casts doubt on these figures, for along a 120 km stretch of the Ruvubu River where several hundred were reported by P. Chardonnet, he recorded only 39 animals, all but two within the Ruvubu National Park, although there may have been more in wallows etc. away from the river, which were not surveyed.<br/><br/>Although there are many gaps in the data, the above analysis suggests that there could be as many as 70,000 Common Hippopotamus in the east African countries.<br/><br/><strong>Southern Africa</strong><br/>Southern Africa also has flourishing populations, with Zambia containing the biggest population, 40,000, of any country in Africa. Others with large numbers include Mozambique (16,000-20,500), Malawi (10,000), Zimbabwe (6,900) and South Africa (5,000). The total in the whole of the region may be around 80,000. <br/><br/>No information has been received from Angola. According to Sidney (1965), the Common Hippopotamus was widespread throughout Angola particularly in the east on the Cunene, Cubango, Cuando, Cuanza, Longa and Zambezi Rivers.  <br/><br/>There are probably more Common Hippopotamus in Zambia than in any other single country. F. E. C. Munyenyembe puts the country-wide total at 40,000 with 20-25,000 in the Luangwa Valley according to R. H. V. Bell. They are reported to be widespread on the Kafue Flats and in Lochinvar National Park. Neighbouring Malawi, although small, is also densely populated with Common Hippopotamus, which occur on all rivers and lakes of sufficient size. The main concentrations are at Elephant Marsh (lower Shire River), the south-west arm of Lake Malawi, Upper Shire River and Lake Malombe in Liwonde National Park. R. H. V. Bell makes a guess that there are some 10,000 Common Hippopotamus in the whole of Malawi. Further south in Zimbabwe, the species is still common. It is found on most of the large rivers particularly the Limpopo. Zambezi and the Sabi/Lundi systems. It is also found in smaller rivers and dams where there is permanent water. Some wander over long distances to provide isolated records. The only estimate for the country-wide total is that made by R. B. Martin on the basis of some limited counts, which have revealed some dense populations e.g. 2,000 on a 50-km section of the Zambezi. His estimate is 6,900, of which 5,530 occur in national parks or reserves, 1,020 on communal lands and 350 elsewhere.<br/><br/>A surprising number of Common Hippopotamus appear to have survived in Mozambique, at least up to 1986, despite the recent civil strife. The species is still widely distributed throughout the country and is present on most river systems. Several national parks and reserves contain hippopotamus although only Gorongosa, with about 2,000, has a sizeable population. L. Tello's estimate made in 1986 year puts the total at between 16,000 and 20,500 for the country as a whole with most (10,000 -12,000) in the Zambezi Wildlife Utilization Area, which includes Marromeu Reserve and four safari hunting blocks. It is also contiguous with the Gorongosa National Park. This is the only region where numbers have increased (by some 20% since 1974). Elsewhere there has been a decline, except in Tete Province, whose population of between 1,500 and 2,500 is said to be stable.<br/><br/>Namibia is too dry to support many Common Hippos except in the north, where the species is present in some numbers on the Cuando and Zambezi Rivers in the Caprivi Strip. Elsewhere it occurs along the boundary with Angola on the Okavango River. Botswana is also too dry, except in the north of the country, where some animals occur in the Okavango Delta and in the Chobe/Linyati River system. A few (18+) exist on the Limpopo in the east. Outside this area, a small population may still exist near Ghanzi although some observers think this is unlikely. C. A. Spinage puts the total in northern Botswana at 1,600 in the wet season and 500 in the dry.<br/><br/>Common Hippopotamus are confined to the north-east of the country in the Republic of South Africa, mainly in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West provinces and the northern tip of KwaZulu-Natal. Most of them are in the Kruger National Park in perennial rivers, dams and the larger pools of seasonal rivers. The total counted in the park in 1989 was 2,761 with 2,575 in rivers and 191 in dams and pools. R. H. Taylor gives a total (for 1986) of 1,264 for KwaZulu-Natal, with the largest concentration (595) on Lake St Lucia, but he suggests a better estimate of 1,423 averaged over the five years 1982-1986. Those in kwaZulu-Natal outside the Kruger National Park are mainly confined to the large rivers in the eastern and northern regions of the province. These figures suggest that there are approaching 5,000 Common Hippopotamus in the country as a whole.<br/><br/>It is not possible to provide a total for the whole of southern Africa because of the lack of data from Angola, which used to support large populations and may do so still, although the disturbed political situation in the country makes it more likely that most hippopotamus have been shot. Assuming the worst and that only a few hundred remain in Angola, a very rough estimate for the regional total would be 80,000.<br/><br/>Follow link below for Table 1: country information including population status, trend, etc.",,"Common Hippos are found in many countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and were previously found in virtually all suitable habitats. The species still occupied much of its former range in 1959, although it had disappeared from most of South Africa except for the Kruger National Park (Sidney 1965). They occur in rivers throughout the savanna zone of Africa, and main rivers of forest zone in Central Africa, in Angola, Benin, northern Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, southern Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Dem. Rep.

4494371,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Not Applicable,,2007,2007-02-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is a vagrant in the marine region covered by the European Mammal Assessment, consequently it is classed as Not Applicable.","Walruses are highly gregarious animals and are frequently found in close knit groups that regularly number in the tens to many hundreds, and aggregations of animals including many groups of these sizes can number in the low thousands.  Walruses also haul out on ice floes and beaches on islands or remote stretches of mainland coastlines forming dense groups of animals lying pressed together and on top of one another. At sea, walruses can be found alone or in large aggregations.<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occurs in the winter. It is believed that walruses are polygynous, the males forming a type of lek, or establishing small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes. Males have an unusual adaptation for producing bell-like sounds underwater. A pair of elastic pharyngeal pouches in the neck can be inflated with air to serve as resonance chambers that make this unique sound. There is also intense male-male fighting at this time. Tusks are used for interspecific aggression, defense against predators, which include polar bears and killer whales, and for aids in hauling-out on ice, but not for digging up food. <br/><br/>Walruses are one of the largest pinnipeds.  Males reach about 3.6 m and 880-1560 kg, females about 3 m and 580-1039 kg.  Newborns are 1-1.4 m and weigh 33-85 kg. Although females can ovulate at four years of age, the majority do not give birth until they are 7-8 years old and usually only produce one calf every three years. Gestation lasts 15 months, including a delay of implantation time of 3-3.5 months. The period of calf dependency is long, regularly taking two years, and can extend longer if a female does not give birth every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>Walruses are primarily bottom feeders and shallow divers. Most prey taken is found in the upper few centimeters of sediment, or on or just above the bottom. A wide variety of benthic invertebrates, with several species of clams, make up the majority of food for most animals. Their diet also includes other species of mollusks, and many species of worms, snails, soft shell crabs, amphipods, shrimp, sea cucumbers, tunicates, and slow-moving fish. Some individuals regularly prey on seals, small whales, and seabirds, and occasionally scavenge marine mammal carcasses (Fay 1982).","All three walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th  through the mid-20th centuries. Native people of the Arctic have depended on walruses for food, hides, ivory, and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests of all three subspecies continue today in most parts of their ranges. <br/><br/>Direct conflicts with fisheries are low; however trawl fisheries can disturb important benthic feeding area (Born 2003).  Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights, and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on walruses out of the water, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance, and easily panicked into stampedes. Fay and Kelly (1980) documented an instance of a mass mortality of approximately 1,000 animals from a stampede event at Saint Lawrence Island. The cause of the stampede is unknown; however this mass mortality event underscores the risks of any source of disturbance to aggregations of hauled-out walruses.    <br/><br/>Global warming and any associated reduction in the extent, timing, and characteristics of seasonal sea ice cover could negatively effect walrus populations. Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregation, and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Moore 2005). In contrast Stirling and Derocher (1993) suggest that climatic warming could result in more favorable conditions for bearded, harp, and harbor seals and walruses if it causes sea ice to become less consolidated in winter, and the summer open water period to lengthen. <br/><br/>Reduction in sea ice could also lead to the addition of commercial sea lanes in rarely visited portions of the walruses’ range, with increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants, disturbance, and coastal development (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Tynan and Demaster 1997, Moore 2005).","The Pacific walrus population recovered from a depleted state in 1950 to historical high levels in the 1980s (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The population was estimated at over 230,000 in 1985 (Gilbert 1989), and 201,000 in 1990 (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 1992). However, difficulties with associated with conducting these surveys greatly reduced the precision of these estimates (Gilbert 1999). The current population level is unknown (Angliss and Lodge 2004). The Atlantic walrus has been extirpated from some areas but estimates are that between 10,000 and 19,000 animals occur from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the Kara Sea (Born <em>et al.</em> 1995, Kastelein 2002). The Laptev population was estimated at 4,000-5,000 animals according to a report cited in Fay (1982), and the current status is unknown. The walrus is a vagrant in the marine region covered by the European Mammal Assessment.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution. The Pacific subspecies is found in the Bering and Chukchi Seas to the East Siberian Sea in the west and the western Beaufort Sea in the east. The Atlantic subspecies occurs in numerous subpopulations from the Eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea, including the Barents and White Seas, and Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. Vagrants have been reported from Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay. The Laptev walrus is confined to the Laptev Sea north of central Russia.  All three subspecies of walruses are found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas, and rarely occur in deeper waters (Scheffer 1958, Fay 1982, Rice 1998, Kastelein 2002).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Coastal Alaska Natives have hunted walruses for subsistence purposes in the United States under an exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection Act since 1972.  No quotas or limits have been established, but all animals taken are required to be harvested in a non-wasteful manner. Quotas on harvest have been imposed in Canada and in the Russian Federation. Walrus hunting in east Greenland has been banned and is regulated in other areas of Greenland. In the Laptev Sea, only natives and members of scientific expeditions are allowed to kill walruses (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe
5325996,15951,Panthera leo,Regionally Extinct,A2abcd,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Lions are extinct in the Mediterranean region, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s.","The lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer in press).  Although lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills. <br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting.  Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g.,  from 266-4,532 km²  in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001), and 20,500 km² in the Serengeti (West and Packer in press). <br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic lion is dry deciduous forest.  The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock.  Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic lion's diet, although the most common prey is the chital deer.  Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The main threats to lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect life and livestock) and prey base depletion.  Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of populations becoming small and isolated (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that each lion cost ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-lion conflict (Frank <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for providing financial resource for lion conservation for both governments and local communities.  However, there is concern that current management regimes can lead to unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Disease has also been a threat to lion populations (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by lions, with up to 400 human lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda 2007).","There have been few efforts in the past to estimate the number of lions in Africa. Myers (1975) wrote, ""Since 1950, their [lion] numbers may well have been cut in half, perhaps to as low as 200,000 in all or even less"". Later, Myers (1986) wrote, ""In light of evidence from all the main countries of its range, the lion has been undergoing decline in both range and numbers, often an accelerating decline, during the past two decades"". In the early 1990s, IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group members made educated ""guesstimates"" of 30,000 to 100,000 for the African lion population (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>The most quantitative historical estimate of the African lion population in the recent past was made by Ferreras and Cousins (1996), who developed a GIS-based model to predict African lion range and numbers, calibrated by surveying experts about the factors affecting lion populations. First they correlated vegetation (Leaf Area Index) with lion densities, using known values from 37 studies in 19 African protected areas, and mapped potential lion range. Then the reduction effect of human activities on lion range and numbers were estimated. Lion experts were surveyed in order to develop and rank a set of factors which would lead to lower lion densities as well as lion absence. These included agriculture, human population density, cattle grazing, and distance from a protected area, and were derived from GIS databases of varying age. For example, in areas identified as main cattle grazing areas lion density was reduced by 90%, and in areas identified as having widespread agricultural cultivation or high human population density (&gt; 2.5 people/km²) Lions were considered absent. Lion density was reduced by 50% in areas with low human population density (1-2.5 people/km²). Because of the age of their data sources on extent of agriculture and pastoralism, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) selected 1980 as the base year for their predicted African lion population of 75,800. They emphasized the need for ground-truthing their estimate by censusing lions, particularly outside protected areas.<br/><br/>Two recent surveys have provided current estimates of the African lion population, with some ground-truthing. The African Lion Working Group, a network of specialists affiliated with the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group, conducted a mail survey and compiled estimates of 100 known African lion populations. Not included were populations of known existence, but unknown or unestimated size. The ALWG African lion population estimate is 23,000, with a range of 16,500-30,000 (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). The second survey was carried out by Philippe Chardonnet and sponsored by the International Foundation for the Conservation of Wildlife and Conservation Force (Chardonnet 2002). He also compiled estimates for 144 individual African lion populations, grouped into 36 largely isolated subpopulations. His methodology included extrapolation of estimates of known populations into areas where lion status was unknown, and his total figure is not surprisingly larger: 39,000 lions in Africa, with a range of 29,000-47,000.<br/><br/>Approximately 30% of the individual population estimates compiled by the African Lion Working Group were based on scientific surveys. Techniques for these surveys included total count based on individually identified body features, sampling by use of calling stations playing recordings of hyaena and/or lion prey, and mark-recapture methods including radio telemetry, photo databases, and spoor counts (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). Seventy percent of their population figures were derived from expert opinion or guesstimate. In the other survey, 63% of Chardonnet's (2002) individual population estimates were based on expert opinions or guesstimates. Twelve percent of Chardonnet's (2002) estimates were based on scientific surveys, and a further 25% were derived from extrapolation of variables from nearby populations and catch-per-unit effort-estimates based on lion trophy hunting.<br/><br/>Estimating the size of the African lion population is an ambitious exercise involving many uncertainties. The three main efforts (Ferreras and Cousins 1996; Chardonnet 2002; Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004) all use different methods. The African Lion Working Group compiled individual population estimates primarily from protected areas (23,000 lions: Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). In 1980, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted 18,600 lions to occur in protected areas. This was probably an underestimate as not all protected areas inhabited by lions at that time were included. Still, the comparison suggests that the number of lions in African protected areas has remained stable or possibly increased over time. But Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted that most lions in 1980 were found outside protected areas. Chardonnet (2002) finds that unprotected areas still comprise a significant portion (half) of the lion's current African range. Comparison of Ferreras and Cousin's (1996) prediction of 75,800 lions in 1980 (roughly three lion generations ago) to Chardonnet's (2002) estimate of 39,000 lions yields a suspected decline of 48.5%. This calculation suggests a substantial decline in lions outside protected areas over the past two decades. Ferreras and Cousins (1996) may have over-estimated the African lion population in 1980, as their number was derived from a model rather than actual lion counts, and so it is possible that the rate of decline of the African lion population may be lower.  A group exercise led by WCS and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group estimated that 42% of major lion populations were declining (Bauer 2008).  The rate of decline is most unlikely to have been as high as 90%, as reported in a series of news reports in 2003 (Kirby 2003, Frank and Parker 2003).<br/><br/>Genetic population models indicate that large populations (50-100 lion prides) are necessary to conserve genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding, which increases significantly when populations fall below 10 prides.  Male dispersal is also an important factor in conserving genetic variation (Bjorklund 2003).  These conditions are met in few wild lion populations, although there are at least 17 lion ""strongholds"" &gt;50,000 km² in extent (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> occurs as an isolated single wild population in India's Gir Forest.  The Gir lion population had been reduced to a very low number in the early years of the 20th century, possibly fewer than 20.  In 1936, 234 lions were estimated, falling to approximately 100 iin the 1970s, and estimates in the 1980s and 1990s around 200 adults (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In 2005,  the population was estimated at 359, +/- 10, including cubs, based on, according to the Chief Minister of Forests for Gujarat state, a total count of lions by direct sighting in a block-system methodology.  This is an increase from 327 reported in 2001 (Anon. 2006).  The Wildlife Protection Society of India reported 34 lion deaths in 2007, due to poaching, electrocution, falling into open wells, and death by motor vehicle and unknown causes.  Single populations are vulnerable to extinction from catastrophic events, and it has long been recommended by scientists to establish a second wild population in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, but this has not yet been done (Jackson 2008).  The Asiatic lion shows reduced genetic variation due to small population size (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 1987).  It is feared that the size of the population is larger than the estimated carrying capacity of the habitat and prey base (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",,"Lions are found in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  In 2005-2006 the Wildlife Conservation Society and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map and assess current lion range in sub-Saharan Africa (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008).  Extent of occurrence is estimated at over 4.5 million km², 22% of historical range.  Most lion range is in eastern and southern Africa (77%).  Current lion status is still unknown over large parts of Africa, 7.6 million km².  <br/><br/>The lion formerly ranged from northern Africa through southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Today, the only remainder of this once widespread population is a single isolated population of the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer in press).",,Terrestrial,"<em>P. leo</em> is included in CITES Appendix II; the Critically Endangered Asiatic lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> is included in CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Africa, lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for lions in west and central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and eastern and southern Africa (IUCN 2006b).  The West and Central African Lion Conservation Strategy focuses on three primary objectives to address threats that directly impact lions:  to reduce lion-human conflict, and to conserve and increase lion habitat and wild prey base.  The objectivs of the Eastern and Southern African Lion Conservation Strategy are aarticulated around the root issues in lion conservation, including policy and land use, socio-economics, trade, and conservation politics.  For example, the policy and land use objective is ""to develop and implement harmonious and comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks that provide for the expansion of wildife-integrated land use, lion conservation and associated socio-economic benefits in current and potential lion range.""  The trade objective is ""to prevent illegal trade in lions and lion products while promoting and safegarding sustainable legal trade.""  Both regional strategies share common priorities of conserving and restoring lion populations, improving managemetn capacity, and increasing the flow of benefits to communities living with lions.  These strategies should be used by governments to guide national lion action plans, policies and programs, and by the conservation community to guide their project development.  By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>For the Asiatic lion, resolving human lion-conflict is a high priority, as well as establishing a second wild population (Jackson 2008).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

According to a recent comprehensive range mapping exercise (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006), most tiger range is found in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (700,991 km², or 60% of tiger range).  The second most common habitat type is temperate and broadleaf mixed forest (251,516 km², or 21% of tiger range), and the third is tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests (122,599 km², or 10% of tiger range).  Other habitat types in which tigers are found include coniferous forest, mangrove forest, and tropical grass and shrubland.  Photos of tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the tiger's diet, and in general tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  Based on studies, Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimate that tigers need to kill 50 large prey animals per year.  Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines.  Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (water buffalo, gaur, banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  <br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges.  Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1-3 females, a typical felid pattern of social organization.  Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - eg, female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at 450 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  Similarly, reported tiger densities range from 11.65 adult tigers per 100 km² where prey is abundant (India's Nagarhole National Park) to as low as 0.13-0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).","Tiger range has contracted by 41% over the last decade (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  The sharpest decrease in area occurred in India, where landscapes with tigers were found to be much smaller and more fragmented than previously assessed in 1997.<br/><br/>While the reduction in range is due in some measure to improved knowledge of tiger distribution over the past decade, Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> (2007) consider habitat loss and poaching for trade to be primary causes of a significant decline in tiger range and numbers.  <br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable tiger populations.  Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of tiger habitat loss.  With their substantial dietary requirements, tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.  Karanth and Stith (1999) consider prey base depletion to be the leading threat to tigers in areas of otherwise suitable habitat.<br/><br/>In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the tiger to extinction (Nowell, 2000).  Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell, 2007).  Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu, 2007).  Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell, 2007).  In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching 5,000.  They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce tiger products, and several are already engaged in illegal production of tiger bone wine.  Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of tiger bone has decreased since China banned tiger bone in 1993.  Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu, 2007).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Shepherd and Magnus, 2004; Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure.  But many tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock.  Conflict-killed tigers can also feed into the illegal trade.  Many tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell, 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for tiger conservation.  In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, 41 people were killed by tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh during an 18-month period in 2001-2003 (Khan 2004).<br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al</em>. (2006) surveyed 77 biologists about threats to tigers in the areas they work in, and compiled the results to indicate threat prevalence across tiger range.  The top twelve threats are listed below, with their Vulnerability Scores:  high scores indicate the threat is severe (e.g., it is reducing tiger populations), is urgent, and is widespread across tiger range.<br/><br/>Threat                              Vulnerability Score<br/><br/>Lack of law enforcement  1943<br/>Hunting of tiger prey        1936<br/>Low tiger population size    1909<br/>Incidental hunting of tigers  1545<br/>Lack of habitat connectivity  1510<br/>Habitat degradation           1499<br/>Export of tiger parts to other areas     1462<br/>Habitat destruction    1386<br/>Directed hunting of tigers    1325<br/>Resource exploitation  1229<br/>Local trade in tiger parts    1030<br/>Lack of legal protection      586 <br/><br/>Source: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. (2006: 14)","Scientific efforts to monitor tiger populations and estimate their size have increased in recent years (Gratwicke <em>et al</em>. 2006).  A collation of national tiger estimates is given below.  While some national populations can be estimated with confidence (notably Russia, India and Nepal), most are admittedly more speculative, ranging from application of site-specific density estimates over large areas to outright guesstimates.  Putting all these national estimates together, the global tiger population is estimated to range from 3,402-5,140.  <br/><br/>A previous compilation of national estimates to determine the global population estimated 5,000-7,000 tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 1999).  While most of these previous estimates were rough and lacked the scientific rigor that has gone into some recent estimates, so that a direct comparison is unreliable, a global population decline is suggested, as would be expected given the documented range reduction of 41% over the last decade (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In terms of conserving the wild tiger's genetic biodiversity, population biologists prefer to work with a number that approximates the actual breeding population, the number of animals which raise offspring to reproductive adulthood, or effective population size (Ne).  The number of breeding tigers in one population was equivalent to just 40% of the actual adult population, based on long-term demographic studies in Nepal's Chitwan National Park (Smith and McDougal, 1991).  Therefore, the tiger's effective population size could be in the range of 1,361-2,056 reproductively successful adults.<br/><br/>National tiger population estimates<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Tigers are now largely restricted to the Sundarbans mangrove forest.  Estimating tiger density based on prey density, Khan (2004) estimated the population at 200.  A higher estimate of 419 was obtained by the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests, which carried out a joint census with their Indian counterparts (MoEF 2004), using a methodology of identifying individual tigers from their tracks which has been criticized as yielding inaccurate results (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2003).  Based on the first data on home range collected from two radio-collared female tigers (11.5 and 13.9 km²), Barlow <em>et al.</em> (2007) roughly estimated there could be 95-286 female tigers in the Sundarbans.  Estimate used for global population:  200-419<br/><br/>Bhutan:  Dorji and Santiapillaai (1989) estimated Bhutan's tiger population at 151 (based on track counts) to 250 (extrapolating to unsurveyed areas).  However, the density they used for their extrapolation (1 adult per 40 km²) was high for the more high-altitude parts of their range.  In Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (where tigers have been recorded up to 4,500 m), Wang (2008) estimates, from camera trapping, a density of one tiger per 200 km².  A similar density for the central Himalayan region was obtained from track surveys by McDougal and Tsering in the late 1990s, 1 tiger/185 km².  Overall, their surveys estimated 67-81 adult tigers in Bhutan; this figure is used in the Govt of Bhutan's 2005 National Tiger Action Plan (Sangay and Wangchuk, 2005), although further research is necessary to clarify tiger abundance and distribution in the country (S. Wang pers. comm. 2008).  Estimate used for global population: 67-81<br/><br/>Cambodia:  Several NGOs working on tiger conservation held a meeting in 2004 to review data for the Tiger Conservation Landscape delineation exercise (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  Based on their work, using a range of methodologies including camera traps and field surveys by biologists and community wildlife rangers, Cambodia's tiger population was estimated at 11-50 tigers (Chheang <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <br/><br/>China:  The Govt of China, State Forest Administration, distributed a presentation at the 2007 International Tiger Symposium held April 2007 in Kathmandu, Nepal.  The total tiger population in China was estimated at 37-50, broken down as follows.  Amur tiger <em>P.t. altaica</em> (northeastern China) 18-22; Bengal tiger P.t. tigris (Motuo county, Tibet) 8-12; Indochinese tiger <em>P.t. corbetti</em> (southern Yunnan province) 11-16; South China tiger <em>P.t. amoyensis</em> (southern China) no definite evidence of continued persistence (Govt of China 2007, GTF 2007).  <br/><br/>India:  India's previous national tiger censuses were based on recognition of individual tiger tracks, and in 2001-2002 estimated the population at 3,642 tigers.  This methodology was criticized by leading tiger scientists for being inaccurate and inefficient (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2003).  A new methodology has been developed as recommended by the 2005 tiger action plan (Govt of India 2005), using GIS mapping systems to extrapolate tiger densities derived from camera trap and sign-based indices of abundance.  The Indian tiger population is now estimated at 1,411 (range 1,165-1,657 (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2008).  The Indian Sundarbans tiger population was not estimated.  Because of the difference in methodology, it is not clear how much of the reduction from the 2001 estimate is due to actual loss of tigers as opposed to a more accurate census result. <br/><br/>Indonesia:  The Sumatran tiger occurs in about 58,321 km² of forested habitat in 12 potentially isolated Tiger Conservation Landscapes totalling 88,351 km² (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006), with about 37,000 km² protected in ten national parks (Govt of Indonesia 2007b).  The tiger population was estimated at 400-500 in the first and second national tiger action plans (Govt of Indonesia 1994, 2007a), and at 342-509 in six major protected areas (estimates from Shepherd and Magnus 2004).  However, incorporating more recent research (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2006, Govt. of Indonesia 2007b), covering most of tiger estimated habitat (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006), suggests the population could be 441-679 (see Red List assessment of <em>Panthera tigris sumatrae</em> for details).  Understanding of Sumatran tiger status will improve when research in the three Tiger Conservation Landscapes in Riau province by Sunarto <em>et al.</em> (2007) is complete.  Estimate used for global population: 441-679<br/><br/>Lao PDR:  No population estimates are available, and Lao PDR is not included in the global population estimate.  Tigers are known to occur in five (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999) to seven areas (GTF 2007).  One of the largest is the 3,446 km² (+ 854 km² proposed extension) Nam Et - Phou Louey National Protected Area.  Based on camera trapping, tiger density there was estimated at 0.2-0.7 per 100 km², a relatively low density suggesting a population of only 7-23 tigers in the reserve (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2006).  Tigers and their large ungulate prey have have been depleted by hunting pressure across the country, and tiger numbers are likely to be low (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999).  <br/><br/>Malaysia:  Based on typical prey biomass in tropical rainforests, energetic needs of tigers, estimated tiger densities from studies carried out in Taman Negara National Park, Malaysia, and others in tropical Asia, and available tiger habitats in Peninsular Malaysia, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the national tiger population at 493-1,480 adult tigers.  The lower bound coincides with the previous population estimate for the country (Topani 1990) and is the number selected as feasible by the country's national tiger action plan (DWNP 2008).  However, based on density estimates derived from camera trapping in six sites in Malaysia during the late 1990s, Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) suggest a lower  population, ""up to several hundred."" Estimate range used for global population: 300-493<br/><br/>Myanmar: The national tiger population was estimated at approximately 150, according to extensive surveys covering much of the country (Lynam 2003).  Most tigers (approximately 100) are found in the large Hukaung Tiger reserve in the north of the country (Lynam <em>et al.</em> in prep.).  Tigers have lost much of their historical range in Myanmar, and where they persist are at very low densities.  The other important area for tigers is the forest complex found in northern and southern Taninthayi Division (approx. 50) (Lynam 2003).  <br/><br/>Nepal:  According to government representatives attending the 2007 International Tiger Symposium of the Global Tiger Forum, a 2006 exercise, based in part on camera trapping, estimated 350-370 tigers.  The same number was obtained in 2005 and also in 1999-2000, and the population is considered stable (GTF 2007). <br/><br/>North Korea:  There have been no surveys since 1998, when tiger tracks were reported along the border with China (Miquelle 1998).<br/><br/>Russia:  In 2005 a comprehensive winter snow tracking census estimated 331-393 adult/sub-adult tigers.  977 fieldworkers covered 1537 transect routes totalling 26,031 km.  Using a similar methodology, 330-371 adult tigers were estimated in 1996.  The more recent number probably reflects more intensive survey effort (Miquelle <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/>Thailand: Tigers occur in 15 spatially disjunct forest complexes in Thailand (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1999), and were recorded in six out of seven forest complexes where camera trap surveys were carried out (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006).  The best area for tigers is Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, with an estimated 113 tigers (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2007).  Extrapolating the density obtained from Huai Kha Khaeng (3.98 tigers per 100 km²) to the large 18,000 km² Western Forest complex, the largest habitat block for tigers in Thailand,  Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> (2007) estimated it could hold 720 tigers, with the potential to harbor 2,000 if prey densities were to increase.  However, this estimate should be treated as speculative pending further data from other parts of the Western Forest complex, where conditions are unlikely to be as good as in Huai Kha Khaeng.  For example, the distribution map in Thailand's national tiger action plan portrays appoximately half of the Western Forest complex population as low density in comparison to the Huai Kha Khaeng population (Tunhikorn <em>et al.</em> 2004).  In other Thai forest complexes, including Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2001) and the Dong Phayayen-Khai Yai complex (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006), tigers were few, occurring at much lower densities than would have been predicted on the basis of habitat quality.  Rabinowitz (1993), using presence/absence surveys and a modified arbitrary density estimate of 1 tiger per 100 km², estimated the Thai tiger population at no more than 250.  Estimate range used for global population: 250-720.<br/><br/>Viet Nam:  According to government representatives attending the 2007 International Tiger Symposium of the Global Tiger Forum, a 2004-2005 exercise estimated not more than 100 tigers in areas along the borders with Lao and Cambodia (GTF 2007).",,"The tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).  Over the past 100 years tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia.  Tigers have lost 93% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  <br/><br/>Tigers are currently found in twelve Asian range states:  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Viet Nam.  They may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence. <br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006) undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map current tiger range.  Priority areas for tigers were delineated and are called Tiger Conservation Landscapes, or TCLs.  TCLs are defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five tigers, and tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade.  The range map shows the TCLs, and maps can be viewed in detail at the Save the Tiger Fund website: http://www.savethetigerfund.org/am/customsource/tiger/mapping/index.cfm<br/><br/>A total of 76 TCLs were delineated, with a total area of 1,184,911 km².  TCLS vary in size, with the largest 269,983 km² in the Russian Far East and the smallest 278 km² in India.  Most TCLs are small: 61 (80%) are less than 10,000 km² in area, and the median area for the entire set is just 2,904 km².  Rabinowitz (1999) and Karanth and Nichols (2002) emphasize the importance of large core zones (&gt;3,000 km²) with a healthy prey base for conservation of viable tiger populations.<br/><br/>However, tiger range is actually smaller than the total area of TCLS, because most TCLS contain area of non-tiger habitat where tigers cannot live (average 55% non-habitat, ranging from 20-70% of a TCL).  The average amount of legally protected area within a TCL is shown below.<br/><br/>However, tigers do occur outside the TCLs.  The exercise also identified 543 Fragments with Tigers - areas of habitat with confirmed tiger presence, but considered too small to support a long-term population.  Also, 491 Tiger Survey Landscapes were highlighted - areas where tiger status is unknown, but where there is some reason to believe tigers might still be present, and which are large enough to support at least five tigers.<br/><br/>The Indian sub-continent (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Bhutan, western Myanmar) is the bioregion with the most TCLS (40) and the highest number of TCLs assessed as being of global importance and of top priority for conservation (11).  Total TCL area 227,569 km².  Median TCL size 2,154 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 15.8%.<br/><br/>The Indochina bioregion (Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam) has a smaller number of TCLs (20, with 6 of top priority) but the largest TCL total area of the four bioregions.  Total TCL area 540,758 km².  Median TCL size 5,288 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 29.2%.<br/><br/>The Southeast Asia bioregion supports 15 TCLs, with 3 of global priority.  Total TCL area 145,285 km².  Median TCL size 3,884 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 36.5%.<br/><br/>The Russian Far East bioregion (which includes small areas of northeastern China and North Korea) has just two TCLs, but includes the world's largest (269,983 km²).  Total TCL area 271,297 km².  Median TCL size 135,649 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 9.9%.<br/><br/>Tiger range has been shrinking not only historically, but also more recently.  Comparison of current TCL area with a previous estimate a decade ago (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997) finds that tiger range has shrunk by 41% in the past ten years.  This discrepancy is due in part to technical reasons including a better state of knowledge and improved tiger detection methodologies (Karanth <em>et al</em>., 2003, Sanderson <em>et al</em>., 2006).  However, Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> (2007) consider tiger poaching and habitat loss to be important causes of this recent decline. <br/><br/>Although tiger range loss has been serious and steep, Sanderson <em>et al</em>. (2006) still consider 77% of current range to consist of ""known and secured breeding populations of tigers in areas large enough for a substantive population.""  Roughly half of all TCLs are big enough to support an estimated 100 tigers or more, with the largest seven TCLs offering the potential to support 500 or more tigers.  Even if tiger populations in these landscapes are below carrying capacity, these areas provide opportunities to increase tiger populations with appropriate conservation measures (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2006).",,Terrestrial,"Tigers have been the focus of substantial conservation effort and investment.  Most range countries have developed or are developing national tiger conservation action plans (see Country Action Plan section of the Save the Tiger Fund website), and have called for IUCN to facilitate an international tiger conservation strategy (Nowell <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  A unique international conservation body, the Global Tiger Forum, brings together tiger range state governments with other governments and NGO members (GTF, 2007).<br/><br/>Tigers are included on CITES Appendix I, banning international trade, and all tiger range states as well as countries with consumer markets have banned domestic trade as well (although implementation has been uneven, and some legal loopholes remain (Nowell, 2007).  At the 14th Conference of the Parties to CITES, stronger enforcement measures were called for, as well as an end to tiger farming (the production of tiger products from captive tigers) (Nowell <em>et al.</em>, 2007).<br/><br/>National governments have invested huge resources in tiger conservation, including India, which has had a special Project Tiger program since the early 1970s.  Increasingly, international inter-governmental organizations such as the World Bank are also supporting tiger conservation.  Nongovernmental organizations have been very active.  S. Christie (in Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006) analyzed tiger conservation funding by non-governmental organizations in the years 1998-2002.  Over $23 million USD was invested, primarily in India, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nepal.  The Save the Tiger Fund, funded in part by ExxonMobil, has invested 12.6 million USD in tiger conservation from 1995-2004 (Gratwicke <em>et al.</em>, 2006).<br/><br/>To address the threat posed by habitat loss and fragmentation of the tiger population, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Panthera Foundation announced plans on January 30 2008 to establish a 5,000 mile-long ""genetic corridor"" from Bhutan to Myanmar that would conserve a large contiguous tiger population.  It would span eight countries and represent the largest block of tiger habitat left on earth.  The proposed corridor includes extensive areas of Bhutan, northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, along with potential connectivity to Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. It was endorsed by the King of Bhutan, his Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who requested other heads of state to support similar efforts.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006) surveyed 77 biologists about the effectivess of conservation measures for tigers in the areas they work in (Tiger Conservation Landscapes), and compiled the results to indicate conservation effectiveness across tiger range.  Scores for 22 conservation measures are given below; high scores indicate high effectiveness and widespread implemenation.  Measures at the top of the list are widely implemented and considered effective.  Measures in the middle require more effort, and measures at the bottom are perceived to be ineffective.  Individual Tiger Conservation Landscapes which received the highest conservation effectivenss scores were in India, Bhutan, Nepal and Malaysia.

They are often found in successional or forest-edge habitats, in scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks that have high densities of small mammals, especially <em>Microtus</em> and <em>Arvicola</em> species (King 1983). Pulliainen (1999) states that coniferous and mixed woodlands are preferred, but that many other habitats are used including tundra and the summits of fells and mountains. Dense forests and deserts are avoided (King 1983). This species is a specialist predator of small mammals, but will occasionally feed on fruit, earthworms, insects, eggs, and birds (King 1983). Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 hectares for males, most often falling between 10 to 40 hectares (King 1983).","In the Iberian Peninsula the species is dependent on two <em>Arvicola</em> species, and these are declining, so loss of prey base may be a threat (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Habitat loss (e.g. as a result of urbanization: Pulliainen 1999) is also a problem in parts of the range. The species is commonly hunted in Russia, where there is also a limited fur trade (R. McDonald pers. comm. 2006). In western and central Europe, the stoat was frequently hunted for its white winter fur up until at least the 1930s (with c.30,000 pelts sold in Finland alone during that decade) (Pulliainen 1999). Availability of prey is the principal factor controlling population density (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999), but disease, parasites and other pressures can also contribute.","The density and structure of populations of this species are unstable, due to short life spans and high reproductive capacity; populations are greatly influenced by fluctuations in prey supply (especially small mammals) (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). Population fluctuations of stoats and their prey tend to increase in magnitude at more northerly latitudes (Pulliainen 1999), although fluctuations have also been recorded in Spain (Blanco 1998, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In France, it was declining, but now has stabilized as a result of full protection (EMA Workshop 2006). In Spain it has been speculated that the population may be declining as a results of declines in the southern water vole <em>Arvicola sapidus</em> (Palomo and Gisbert 2002), but the population trend has not been quantified in Spain or Portugal (Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). Despite population fluctuations, it is a widespread and abundant species.",Stable,"The stoat has a very large circumboreal range, inhabiting central and northern Eurasia, northern North America and north-eastern Greenland. It has been introduced to New Zealand. In Europe, it is present as far south as 41ºN in Portugal (Santos Reis 1983), and is found on most islands with the exception of Iceland, Svalbard, and some small North Atlantic islands; it does not occur on Mediterranean islands. In Japan, it is present in central mountains (northern and central Japan Alps) to northern part of Honshu (primarily above 1,200 m) and Hokkaido (Abe <em>et al.</em> 2005).

Although it is declining in some parts of its European and global range, the bulk of the population is found in the Alps and is relatively secure. Consequently it is classed as Least Concern. However, several chamois subspecies qualify as globally threatened, and require urgent conservation action.","Alpine chamois inhabit steep, rocky areas in the mountains, utilising a variety of habitats including alpine meadows, open rocky areas, mixed broadleaf woodland, and coniferous woodland (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). They feed on grasses and herbs, and on the leaves of trees (Sägesser and Krapp 1986).","Poaching and over-hunting may be a problem for the species in parts of its range, especially where it occurs outside protected areas and private hunting reserves (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Many of the less numerous subspecies (e.g. <em>R. r. balcanica</em>, <em>R. r. cartusiana</em>, and <em>R. r. tatrica</em>) are threatened by the deliberate introduction of subspecies from other geographic areas (especially <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>), leading to hybridisation and genetic swamping (Shackleton 1997). Human disturbance, particularly as a result of increased tourism and leisure activities in mountain areas, may also be a problem (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Competition with domestic livestock and introduced species such as the mouflon <em>Ovis aries</em> is a threat to the more vulnerable subspecies, although it is not considered to be a major problem for <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>. <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> does, however, suffer periodic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, causing local population declines (Shackleton 1997). In 2006 a new disease, pestivirus, was first recorded in this subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In general, habitat loss is not a major threat to the species, as much of its range falls within protected areas. However, habitat loss may be a problem in some areas (e.g. for subspecies <em>balcanica </em>in Albania) (Shackleton 1997). Because its population is very small indeed, subspecies <em>cartusiana </em>is susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic demographic or environmental events (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006).","The Alpine chamois is widespread and generally increasing. Excluding the Caucasus population, there are an estimated 440,000 individuals in Europe, and in some protected areas densities may exceed 20 individuals per hectare (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999, S.

Lovari pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/><em>R. r. caucasica</em>: There is very little data on the status of this subspecies, but it is declining and has virtually disappeared outside protected areas (EMA Workshop 2006).<br/><br/><em>R. r. rupicapra</em>: This subspecies is widespread and abundant in the Alps. The number of individuals culled per year in the Swiss Alps and Jura mountains has increased steadily from c.4,000 individuals in 1950 to c.17,000 individuals in 2000 (Loison <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/><em>R. r. tatrica</em>: The population was estimated at 220 in 1999 (Jurdíková 2000), and had dropped below 200 by 2002 (S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006). Numbers have been declining steadily since the 1960s (Jurdíková 2000).",Unknown,"The Alpine chamois is native to mountainous parts of central and southern Europe and Asia Minor, where it occurs as  seven subspecies: <em>balcanica</em>, <em>carpatica</em>, <em>cartusiana</em>, <em>rupicapra</em>, <em>tatrica</em>, <em>asiatica </em>and <em>caucasica</em>(Shackleton 1997, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999).

Detailed conservation recommendations are given in Shackleton (1997). In general, conservation recommendations that apply to all subspecies include ensuring that any harvest is sustainable (through research, legislation, and international cooperation), reducing poaching (through legislation, enforcement, education and awareness-raising, and provision of alternative livelihoods where necessary), reducing the impacts of human disturbance (by providing refugia in areas with intense tourism), and protecting the genetic integrity of populations (by avoiding translocations of 'foreign' subspecies that could hybridise with the local population) (Shackleton 1997).

Significant declines have been reported in many parts of the rabbit's European range, and it is inferred that declines approach 30% over the last 10 years overall. Consequently the species is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A2b). In many countries outside Europe, the rabbit is an alien invasive species that is itself a threat to many other species; the listing of Near Threatened in Europe should not in any way deter efforts to eradicate the rabbit in areas where it is a conservation problem.","The rabbit occupies a variety of habitats, including grassland, meadows, pastures, arable field-margins, sand-dunes, grassy cliffs, heathland and open woodland. In summer, it feeds on the vegetative parts of a variety of grasses and herbaceous plants, and in winter it eats grasses, bulbs and bark (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). It can be an agricultural pest in areas where it is abundant, and it has caused severe damage to native ecosystems in some areas where it has been introduced (for example Australia) (Ward 2005). Rabbits are an essential keystone element of the Mediterranean ecosystem in Spain and Portugal, being preyed on by at least 39 predator species including the Critically Endangered Iberian lynx <em>Lynx pardinus</em> and the vulnerable and range-restricted Iberian imperial eagle <em>Aquila adalberti</em> (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006). Rabbit declines are considered to have had a negative impact on both of these threatened species (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006).","Myxomatosis caused severe population declines in the 1950s, but numbers subsequently rallied as the myxoma virus become less virulent and the rabbit more immune (Macdonald and Barrett 1993, Macdonald and Tattersall 2001). Myxomatosis was deliberately introduced to Europe in 1952 in an effort to control rabbit numbers; it originates from South America (Ward 2005). Declines in recent years have been attributed to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; also known as DHV), myxomatosis, and over-hunting (Ward 2005, Spitzenberger 2005). RHD is believed to have originated in Europe, where it was first detected in 1987 (Ward 2005). Habitat loss (due to agriculture, forestry, development, forest fires and land abandonment) is considered to be a contributory factor to rabbit decline in Iberia (Ward 2005). It is a popular game species, and over-hunting may be a problem in some parts of its range. Pest control measures may cause local population declines. There have been attempts in Australia to develop a genetically modified immunocontraceptive virus for rabbits, and accidental or deliberate illegal spread of such a virus could be a threat to rabbits in the future (Henzell and Cooke 2003, Trout 2003, Ward 2005).","It is a common species throughout much of its European range. Population densities of 0.5 to 10 individuals per hectare are typical, with densities of up to 100 individuals per hectare having been recorded (Homolka and Zima 1999). However, in at least some parts of Europe the species has undergone significant decline in recent years. In Portugal, a population reduction of 24% was recorded between 1995 and 2002 (Alves and Ferreira 2002), and in Spain and Portugal as a whole it is estimated that there are now as few as 5% of the number of rabbits that existed 50 years ago (Ward 2005). Large declines since 1990 have also been noted in Austria (Spitzenberger 2005) and Germany (Eylert 2004), and in the UK the species declined significantly between 1995 and 2002 (different survey methods give a 48% decline from 1995-2002 and a 23% decline from 1997-2002: Battersby 2005). Subspecies <em>O. c. huxleyi</em>, which occurs on certain Atlantic and Mediterranean islands, has a restricted range and may be threatened (Homolka and Zima 1999).",Decreasing,"<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> is a widespread and abundant species, which has been introduced to all continents except Antartica. It was originally restricted to Spain, Portugal, western France, and northern Africa, but it has spread over the last two millenia to almost all parts of the European region, including the British Isles, many Mediterranean islands, the Azores, and Madeira. This range expansion occurred partly because of deliberate introductions, as the rabbit was widely exploited as a food source, and partly through natural spread. It remains absent from most of Fennoscandia, and occurs only sporadically on the Balkan peninsula. Outside Europe, it was introduced to Australia, in 1788 and again in 1859, where it is now widespread (Thompson and King 1994). It was introduced to South America unsuccessfully several times since the mid-nineteenth century, and successfully in about 1936; it now maintains a limited range in Argentina and Chile (Thompson and King 1994). Found in many islands in the Pacific, off the African coast, New Zealand, and the Caribbean (Thompson and King 1994).",,Terrestrial,"The issue of eradication of <em>O. cuniculus</em> from its introduced range (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and many islands) may have overshadowed the significance of rabbit decline in its native range. However, the importance of <em>O. cuniculus</em> within its natural range necessitates that it be considered for listing as threatened in spite of its global abundance. It is a keystone component of the Iberian ecosystem, as prey for specialist predators (Virgos <em>et al.</em> 2005) and as a landscape modeller (Delibes <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ward 2005). It is an important game species in Spain and Portugal (Ward 2005). <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> occurs in some protected areas within its natural range, including Donana National Park in Spain (Ward 2005) and Serra da Malcata Nature reserve in Portugal (700km<sup>2</sup>) where the Iberian lynx is protected.<br/><br/>Ward (2005) summarises key issues regarding the conservation of the European rabbit within its native range: <br/>""- Establish rabbit monitoring programs to accurately describe decline directly.<br/>- Create and implement a management plan for rabbit recovery that prioritizes critical ranges and populations. Some plans have begun for local regions, including Donana National park.  <br/>- Programs to limit the incidence and impact of new and existing diseases may be difficult in the wild, though some success has been observed in captive populations. Current vaccines do not confer total immunity to RHD or myxomatosis, have side effects such as increasing vulnerability to predators, and have short-lived effectiveness. A genetically modified live myxomatosis virus vaccine, LapinVac, is controversial because of the possibility of unpredictable evolution of the virus, and its potential spread to rabbit populations outside the natural <em>O. cuniculus</em> range where eradication, not conservation, is the objective. Increasing habitat quality may indirectly help rabbit disease resistance. Controlling disease vectors for myxomatosis has not been found to be effective. Preventing the spread of modified immunocontraceptive viruses engineered in Australia to control rabbit fertility may become an issue.<br/>- Reducing hunting impact is not guaranteed to reduce decline because disease effects often outweigh hunting as a threat, and because implementation of restrictions would likely not be realistic given the prevalence of hunting in Iberia. Revisions to existing hunting seasons have been proposed and some tested, but even moving the season to summer when rabbits are most abundant has caused concern in trials because the overall catch increases and the season coincides with a peak in death from disease. A growing recognition among hunters of the issue of rabbit decline has led to some self-restraint, and though often well intentioned, uninformed management strategies are leading to inappropriate actions. Rather than focusing on hunting restraint, many hunters exert efforts to reduce rabbit predators, which are not directly responsible for decline. As a very large demographic, hunters could represent a powerful force in maintaining sustainable hunting populations, if the awareness of the issue of decline increased within this group.<br/>- Rabbit populations affected by agriculture represent a sensitive issue, as rabbits are typically seen as a pest and an economic liability for farmers. Despite pressures from environmental groups, many farmers continue to take measures to eradicate rabbits from their land, even in areas where rabbit populations have declined dramatically. Awareness among farmers of rabbit conservation issues is low. Government policy allows farmers to control rabbits with permits, and though crop loss due to rabbit damage is economically subsidized, no requirement of those compensated is made for conservation.<br/>- Halting and reversing habitat loss and fragmentation was aided in the 1990s by the establishment of many national parks in Spain, but much optimal rabbit habitat is on private land. A shift from high-intensity farming and monoculture forestry back to mixed agro-forestry and small scale farming would help sustain rabbit populations. Natura 2000 promotion of sustainable development and EU subsidies supporting environmentally friendly agriculture are promising but underfunded and too new to demonstrate a significant impact. Eucalyptus plantation removal has demonstrated a positive effect on rabbit populations, but may compromise other environmental issues such as erosion and conditioned bird habitat, as well as economic impact.<br/>- Reintroductions have been a key focus of conservation efforts, with up to 500,000 released annually in Spain and France. The efforts so far have not increased rabbit populations, due to increased mortality from predation and inadvertent spread of disease, which may actually have a net negative impact. The flaws in reintroduction practices do not completely negate the importance of the efforts, which have been shown to help sustain predators and hunting populations. The success of introductions may be increased by fencing from predators and competitors and preventing dispersal.<br/>- Though rabbit predators have not directly caused rabbit decline, factors that have caused initial decline (e.g., disease, habitat loss) are exacerbated by some opportunistic predators (while not caused by specialist predators like the Iberian lynx and Imperial eagle). Game keeping efforts to increase rabbit populations often focus on predator reduction, sometimes counterproductively, causing decline of top predators that are already threatened. Efforts could be more productively focused on habitat protection, reduction of rabbit mortality by humans (hunting, poisoning), and reducing disease impacts.""",Afrotropical|Australasian|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

Population size, area of occupancy, and habitat quality are all declining, and the species faces a number of serious threats including bycatch, habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, and competition from introduced species. Surveys in Russia indicate that the population declined from 39,000 in 1985 to 27,000 in 2000/2001, and it is suspected that rates of decline have increased since then. The desman recently went extinct in Belarus. Overall, it is suspected that declines exceed 30% over a ten-year period in the past or future, so the species is classed as Vulnerable.","A riparian species, it is found in holes primarily along oxbow lakes, less frequently by rivers and ponds. It does not inhabit all water bodies within its range; it has quite strict habitat requirements and prefers water bodies with rich water-marsh vegetation, bushes and primary forests along the banks. Prefers lakes with 1-2 m depth with rich invertebrate fauna. Also found in small rivers with slow flow. In favourable years it is able to reproduce during the whole year, but usually has two reproduction peaks at the end of spring and autumn. Males participate in care of young. Omnivorous, recorded feeding on at least 72 species of water invertebrates and 30 plant species, as well as fish and amphibians.","The main threat to the Russian desman at present is the widespread use of fixed fishing nets. These nets, which are used by poachers, have become increasingly cheap and widely available in recent years: a recent study recorded 50 'outlets' freely selling these nets on the Moscow-Vladimir section of the Nizhny Novgorod highway alone (http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html). The very low price and high durability of modern nets means that poachers often leave them in the water for days or even months, checking them only occasionally and often abandoning them. A desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. <br/><br/>The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the desman depends upon.  <br/><br/>A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced nutria (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>) and muskrats (<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>) may also be a threat.","At the beginning of the 1970s in the Soviet Union there were about 70,000 individuals, of which the majority occurred in Russia, with about 1,500 individuals in Kazahstan and single records in Ukraine and Belarus. More recent surveys in the Russian Federation indicate that the population there declined from 39,000 in 1985 to 27,000 in 2000/2001, and it is suspected that rates of decline have increased since then owing to growing threats from fisheries bycatch. The 2000/2001 survey covered around 30,000 km of the banks of rivers, lakes and artificial reservoirs, and a uniform methodology was used (see the Biodiversity Conservation Centre website http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html for further details). In Ukraine the desman is currently very rare and in Belarus it has recently been extirpated.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan; it has recently disappeared from Belarus. At the beginning of the 20th century the desman was common in the Dnepr, Don, Volga and Ural rivers basins. Its current range is very fragmented, and it has disappeared form many areas where it formerly occurred. At the end of the 19th century it disappeared from Ukraine, but was reintroduced in the 1950s. In the 1990s it was found again in the Desna (a tributary of the Dnepr, Ukraine).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The desman is listed in the Russian Red Data Book (under category 2: declining in number rare relict species). It is protected in the buffer zone of Okskiy, Voronezhskiy, Kaluzhskie Zaseki  Zapovednik, and Ugra National Parks and several small protected areas. This species has been the subject of re-introductions attempts. Recently, conservationists tried to reintroduce it to the Desna basin, in the area of Bryanskiy Les Zapodnenik. The Biodiversity Conservation Centre has started a public campaign against nylon nets and electro-fishing. <br/><br/>Conservation measures recommended to stabilize and improve the condition of the Russian desman throughout its range include the following:<br/>· Banning the unrestricted sale of nets and net-making materials;<br/>· Developing a system of measures to combat electric landing nets; and<br/>· Setting up specialized hunting reserves in the desman's key areas of habitation.",Palearctic,,false,false,Europe
12828813,7140,Elephas maximus,Endangered,A2c,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered (EN) because of a population size reduction inferred to be at least 50% over the last three generations, based on a reduction in its area of occupancy and the quality of its habitat. Although there are few accurate data on historical population size, from what is known about trends in habitat loss/degradation and other threats including poaching, an overall population decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (estimated to be 60–75 years, based on a generation time estimated to be 20–25 years) seems realistic.","Asian elephants are generalists and they occur in grassland, tropical evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forested and dry thorn forest, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Over this range of habitat types elephants are seen from sea level to over 3,000 m asl. In the Eastern Himalaya in northeast India, they regularly move up above 3,000 m asl in summer at a few sites (Choudhury, 1999). The Asian elephant is one of the last few mega-herbivores (i.e. plant-eating mammals that reach an adult body weight in excess of 1,000 kg) still extant on earth (Owen-Smith, 1988). Given their physiology and energy requirements, elephants need to consume large quantities of food per day. They are generalists and browse and graze on a variety of plants. The proportions of the different plant types in their diet vary depending upon the habitat and season. During dry season in southern India, Sukumar (1992) observed that 70% of the elephant's diet was browse, while in wet season, grasses make up about 55%. However, in an adjoining area, Baskaran (2002) observed that browse formed only 15% of the diet in dry deciduous forest and 47% of the diet in the thorn forest in the dry season, while the annual diet was dominated by grass (84%). In Sri Lanka, elephants may feed on more than 60 species of plants belonging to 30 families (McKay, 1973). In southern India, Baskaran (2002) recorded that elephants fed on 82 species of plants (59 woody plant species and 23 grass species). Elephants may spend up to 14–19 hrs a day feeding, during which they may consume up to 150 kg of wet weight (Vancuylenberg, 1977). They defecate about 16–18 times a day, producing about 100 kg of dung. Dung also helps disperse germinating seeds. <br/><br/>Elephants range over large areas and home ranges in excess of 600 km² have been recorded for females in south India (Baskaran <em>et al</em>., 1995). In north India, female home ranges of 184–326 km² and male home ranges of 188–407 km² have been recorded (Williams, 2002). Smaller home range sizes, 30–160 km² for females and 53–345 km² for males, have been recorded in Sri Lanka (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2005). Given their requirements for large areas, elephants are regarded as an “umbrella species” because their conservation will also protect a large number of other species occupying the same area. They are also a premier “flagship species” and are sometimes regarded as a “keystone species” because of their important ecological role and impact on the environment.<br/><br/>The life span of Asian elephants is 60 to 70 years, and males reach sexual maturity at between 10–15 years of age; females usually first give birth in years 15 or 16 (Shoshani and Eisenberg, 1982).","The pre-eminent threats to the Asian elephant today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation (Leimgruber <em>et al</em>., 2003; Sukumar, 2003; Hedges, 2006), which are driven by an expanding human population, and lead in turn to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when elephants eat or trample crops. Hundreds of people and elephants are killed annually as a result of such conflicts. The long-term future of elephants outside protected areas, as well as in some protected areas, is therefore inextricably linked to mitigating such human–elephant conflicts, and this is one of the largest conservation challenges in Asia today (Sukumar, 1992, 2003; Hedges 2006).<br/><br/>Asian elephants live in the region of the world with the densest human population, growing at a rate of between 1–3% per year. Because elephants require much larger areas of natural habitat than most other terrestrial mammals in Asia, they are one of the first species to suffer the consequences of habitat fragmentation and destruction and because of its great size and large food requirements, the elephant cannot co-exist with people in areas where agriculture is the dominant form of land-use. In extreme cases, elephants have been confined as so called ‘pocketed herds’ in small patches of forest in landscapes dominated by man. Such ‘pocketed herds’ represent an extreme stage in the human–elephant conflict (Olivier, 1978). In other cases elephants have been caught and taken to so-called Elephant Training Centres where they languish, lost to the wild population (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005, 2006). <br/><br/>Poaching is a major threat to elephants in Asia too, although reliable estimates of the number of elephants killed and the quantities of ivory and other body parts collected and traded are scarce (Sukumar <em>et al</em>., 1998; Milliken, 2005). It has been argued that poaching is a relatively minor threat to Asian elephant because some males and all females lack tusks (Dawson and Blackburn, 1991). However, the reality is that elephants are poached for a variety of other products (including meat and leather) in addition to ivory, and poaching is now acknowledged as a threat to the long-term survival of some Asian elephant populations (e.g. Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Menon, 2002). Moreover, poaching of elephants for ivory is a serious problem in some parts of Asia (Sukumar, 1992; Menon <em>et al</em>., 1997). In Periyar Tiger Reserve in southern India, for example, ivory poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios: over the 20-year period from 1969 to 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122 (Chandran, 1990). Selective removal of tusked males has several implications for the affected populations: sex ratios obviously become highly female biased, genetic variation is reduced, and fecundity and recruitment may decline (Sukumar <em>et al</em>., 1998; Sukumar, 2003). Poaching of elephants is also a major problem in other parts of Asia. Large-scale hunting of elephants for ivory, bushmeat, hides, and other products has reduced their populations significantly over a wide area from Myanmar to Indonesia (Menon <em>et al</em>., 1997; Duckworth and Hedges, 1998; Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Martin and Stiles, 2002; Menon, 2002; World Wide Fund for Nature, 2002a; Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005).","A recent estimate for the global population size of the Asian elephant was 41,410–52,345 animals Sukumar (2003) The estimated population size for each country was: Bangladesh 150–250; Bhutan 250–500; Cambodia 250–600; China 200–250; India 26,390–30,770; Indonesia 2,400–3,400; Lao PDR 500–1,000; Malaysia 2,100–3,100; Myanmar 4,000–5,000; Nepal 100–125; Sri Lanka 2,500–4,000; Thailand 2,500–3,200; and Viet Nam 70–150 (Sukumar, 2003) . However, Blake and Hedges (2004) and Hedges (2006) argue that the oft-repeated global population ‘estimate’ of about 40,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants is no more than a crude guess, which has been accepted unchanged for a quarter of a century. They argue that with very few exceptions all we really know about the status of Asian elephants is the location of some (probably most) populations, with in some cases a crude idea of relative abundance; and for some large parts of the species range we do not even know where the populations are, or indeed if they are still extant. These difference of opinion are due in part to the difficulty in counting elephants in dense vegetation in difficult terrain, different survey techniques being used in different places, and a too-widely held belief that population monitoring is unimportant. Nevertheless, whatever the error margins, it appears almost certain that over 50% of the remaining wild Asian elephants occur in India. <br/><br/>The overall population trend of the Asian elephant has been downwards, probably for centuries. This remains the case in most parts of its range, but especially in most of the countries of South-east Asia. Within India, there is evidence that the large population in the Western Ghats in south of the country has been increasing in recent years due to improved conservation effectiveness.",Decreasing,"Asian elephants formerly ranged from West Asia along the Iranian coast into the Indian subcontinent, eastwards into South-east Asia including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and into China at least as far as the Yangtze-Kiang. This former range covered over 9 million km² (Sukumar 2003). Asian elephants are now extinct in West Asia, Java, and most of China The western populations (<em>Elephas maximus asurus</em>) were probably extinct by 100 BC, and the main Chinese populations (sometimes referred to as <em>E. m. rubridens</em>) disappeared sometime after the 14th century BC. Even within its surviving range in South and South-east Asia, the species has been in retreat for hundreds if not thousands of years, and generally survives only in highly fragmented populations (Olivier 1978; Sukumar 2003; Blake and Hedges 2004).<br/><br/>Asian elephants still occur in isolated populations in 13 states, with a very approximate total range area of 486,800 km² (Sukumar 2003; but see Blake and Hedges 2004). The species occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in South Asia and Cambodia, China, Indonesia (Kalimantan and Sumatra) Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam in South-east Asia. Feral populations occur on some of the Andaman Islands (India).<br/><br/>The elephants of Borneo were believed to be feral descendants of elephants introduced in the 14th–19th centuries (Shoshani and Eisenberg, 1982; Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008); however, recent genetic evidence suggests they are indigenous to the island (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2003; but see Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008). <br/><br/>The species was once found throughout Sri Lanka, but today elephants are restricted mostly to the lowlands in the dry zone where they are still fairly widespread in north, south, east, north-western, north-central and south-eastern Sri Lanka; but with the exceptions of small remnant populations in the Peak Wilderness Area and Sinharaja Area, elephants are absent from the wet zone of the country. The species continues to lose range to development activities throughout the island. <br/><br/>Once widespread in India, the species is now restricted to four general areas: northeastern India, central India, northwestern India, and southern India. In northeastern India, the elephant range extends from the eastern border of Nepal in northern West Bengal through western Assam along the Himalaya foothills as far as the Mishmi Hills. From here it extends into eastern Arunachal Pradesh, the plains of upper Assam, and the foothills of Nagaland. Further west, it extends to the Garo Hills of Meghalaya through the Khasi Hills, to parts of the lower Brahmaputra plains and Karbi Plateau. Elsewhere in the south in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and the Barak valley districts of Assam, isolated herds occur (Choudhury, 1999). In central India, highly fragmented elephant populations are found in the States of Orissa, Jharkhand, and the southern part of West Bengal, with some animals wandering into Chattisgarh. In north-western India, the species occurs in six fragmented populations at the foot of the Himalayas in Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh, ranging from Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Bahraich Forest Division in the east, to the Yamuna River in the west. In southern India, elephants occur in the hilly terrain of the Western Ghats and in parts of the Eastern Ghats in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and, relatively recently, Andhra Pradesh. There are eight main populations in southern India, each fragmented from the others: northern Karnataka; the crestline of Karnataka–Western Ghats; Bhadra–Malnad; Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats; Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore; Anamalais–Parambikulam; Periyar–Srivilliputhur; and Agasthyamalais.<br/><br/>In Nepal, elephants were once widespread in the lowland Terai, but are now restricted to a few protected areas along the border with India: Royal Chitwan National Park, Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Royal Bardia National Park, and Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, and their environs. There is some movement of animals between these protected areas and between Bardia National Park and the adjacent parts of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, all the existing elephant populations are found along the border with India. They are reported from Royal Manas National Park, Namgyal Wangchuk Wildlife Sanctuary, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Reserve Forests such as Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary, Dungsum, and Mochu. In the past, elephants made seasonal migrations from Bhutan to the grasslands of India during the wetter summer months of May to October, returning to their winter range in Bhutan from November. Now these movements are restricted as a result of loss of habitat on the Indian side and fragmentation of habitat on the Bhutan side. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, the species was once widespread, but today it is largely restricted to areas that are relatively less accessible to humans, mainly Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the southeast. In addition, some animals periodically visit the New Samanbag area of Maulvi Bazar District under the Sylhet Forest Division in the north-east of the country, coming from the neighbouring Indian states of Tripura, Meghalaya, and Assam.<br/><br/>The Asian elephant has a wide, but highly fragmented, distribution in Myanmar. The five main areas of elephant abundance are: the Northern Hill Ranges, the Western Hill Ranges, Pegu Yoma (central Myanmar), Tenasserim Yoma (in the south, bordering Thailand), and Shan State or eastern Yoma.<br/><br/>In Thailand, the species occurs mainly in the mountains along the border with Myanmar, with smaller fragmented populations occurring in the peninsula in the south (in several forest complexes, south to the border with Malaysia); in the northeast (in the Dong Phaya Yen-Khao Yai forest complex, including Khao Yai National Park, and the Phu Khieo-Nam Nao forest complex); and in the east (in a forest complex composing the Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Khitchakut National Park, and Khao Cha Mao National Park).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, elephants are primarily found in the mountains of the south-west and in Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri Provinces. Recent surveys in Keo Sema District (Mondulkiri Province) suggest that important numbers may remain in that area (WCS unpubl. data). Elsewhere, Asian elephants persist in Cambodia in only small, scattered populations (Duckworth and Hedges, 1998).<br/><br/>In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, elephants remain widely but very patchily distributed in forested areas, both in the highlands and lowlands. Two important and likely viable populations are known, one in Xaignaboli Province west of the Mekong and one on the Nakai Plateau. Other potentially important elephant populations occur in Phou Phanang and Phou Khao Khoay in Vientiane Province; Phou Xang He in Savannakhet Province; Dong Ampham and Dong Khanthung, including Xe Pian, close to Cambodian border; and Nam Et, Nam Xam, Phou Dendin, and Nam Ha in the north, close to the Viet Namese and Chinese borders.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, only a small population persists now. In the northern part of the country there are no elephants left, barring occasional wanderers into Son La from Lao PDR. In the central and southern parts of the country, very small isolated populations remain in Dak Lak, Nghe An, Quang Nam, Dong Nai, and Ha Tinh Provinces. <br/><br/>In China, Asian elephants once ranged widely over much of southern China, including the Fujiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). The species was extirpated in southern Fujiang and northern Guangdong during the 12th century, but evidence indicates persistence in Guanxi into the 17th century (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). All that now remains of this once widespread elephant population in China is the remnant in Yunnan where the species survives in three prefectures: Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang.<br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, the species is still widely distributed in the interior of the country in the following States: Pahang (which probably has the largest population), Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Negeri Sembilan (where very few animals remain).<br/><br/>On Borneo, elephants only occur in the lowlands of the northeastern part of the island in the Malaysian State of Sabah and adjacent parts of Kalimantan (Indonesia). In Sabah, they occur in forested areas in the south, centre, and east of the State in the following Districts: Kinabatangan, Sandakan, Beluran, Lahad Datu, Tawau, and Pensiangan. In Kalimantan, elephants occur only in the Upper Sembakung River in Tindung District. The origin of the elephants of Borneo remains unclear and the subject of debate. Due to the limited distribution of the island’s elephant population it is argued by some that the species was not indigenous, but descended from imported captive elephants (Medway 1977; Cranbrook <em>et al</em>., 2008). However, others argues that while captive elephants have undoubtedly been brought to Borneo, genetic analyses have shown that the elephants found on Borneo are genetically distinct, with molecular divergence indicating a Pleistocene colonization and subsequent isolation (Fernando <em>et al</em>., 2003)<br/><br/>On Sumatra (in Indonesia), the elephant was once widespread, but now survives only in highly fragmented populations. In the mid-1980s, 44 discrete elephant populations were known to exist in Sumatra’s eight provinces, 12 of these were in Lampung Province (Blouch and Haryanto, 1984; Blouch and Simbolon, 1985). However, by 2003, only three of Lampung’s 12 populations were extant (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). An unknown number of Sumatra’s other elephant populations remain (Blake and Hedges, 2004), and those that do are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and as a result of conflict with humans (Santiapillai and Jackson, 1990; Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). Nevertheless, the island is thought to hold some of the most significant populations outside of India. For example, recent surveys in Lampung Province’s two national parks, Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas, produced population estimates of 498 (95% CI=[373, 666]) and 180 (95% CI=[144, 225]) elephants, respectively (Hedges <em>et al</em>., 2005). Bukit Barisan Selatan NP is therefore a critically important area for Asian elephant conservation. The challenge now is to protect these populations from further habitat loss and poaching.","The Asian elephant is hunted for ivory, food, leather and other products. Live animals are also removed from the wild and used in forestry operations and for ceremonial purposes.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. The most important conservation priorities for the Asian elephant are: 1) conservation of the elephant's habitat and maintaining habitat connectivity by securing corridors; 2) the management of human–elephant conflicts as part of an integrated land-use policy that recognizes elephants as economic assets from which local people need to benefit or at least no suffer; 3) better protection to the species through improved legislation and law enforcement, improved and enhanced field patrolling, and regulating/curbing trade in ivory and other elephant products. Monitoring of conservation interventions is also needed to assess the success or failure of the interventions so that adjustments can be made as necessary (i.e. adaptive management). Reliable estimation of population size and trends will be needed as part of this monitoring and adaptive management approach.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Adults reach lengths of 2-2.5m and weights of 250-300 kg (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1999) with females typically being slightly larger than males (Kovacs 2002). In the Bering Sea, males have been recorded to reach 390 kg and females 361 kg (Kelly 1988). Sexual maturity is reached at 3-6 years in females, with 80% of females having had a pup by age 6. Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Kelly 1988).  Physical maturity occurs at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958), and they can live 20-25 years (Kovacs 2002). Bearded seal pups are born on the sea ice, but they swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2002), and before they are weaned they are spending about half their time in the water. <br/><br/>Bearded seals primarily feed on or near the bottom, and most diving is to depths of less than 100m (Kovacs 2002).  Therefore they live primarily in waters overlying the continental shelf, like much of the relatively shallow Bering Sea when it is seasonally covered with ice (Burns 1981).  Adults have been recorded to dive to nearly 300 m, and young pups to over 488 m (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Ice is also a determinant of habitat. Bearded seals are typically found away from shore-fast ice and unbroken heavily covered ice fields, preferring areas with moving ice where ice movement, currents, weather and land features interact to create broken ice fields, leads, polynas, and other open areas (Burns 1981).  They rarely haul out more than a body length from water (Kovacs 2002).  Bearded seals are typically solitary animals, but will form loose aggregations when ice availability is low (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>The diet of bearded seals varies by age, location, season, and possibly changes in prey availability in marine communities over long time periods (Kelly 1988).  Their primary foods live on or near the bottom, but also include some infauna and schooling and demersal fish (Burns 1981). At Svalbard, bearded seals took a wide variety of prey and over half of the stomachs examined had 5 or more species. Arctic cod, found in 44% of the animals, sculpins (Cottidae spp.) in 44%, spider crab (<em>Hyas araneus</em>) in 59%, and the crustaceans <em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus</em> 59% and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em> 46%, were the most frequently found prey items (Hjelset <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>In June, following the pupping and breeding season, bearded seals undergo their annual molt. During the molt they spend much of their time hauled out, and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004). Animals can be found molting from April to August with a peak in May to June (Burns 1981). Bearded seals usually haul out on ice when it is available, but will haul out on land in the summer in the Sea of Okhotsk, along the Laptev, White, and Kara Sea coastlines (Burns 1981), and at Svalbard (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Important natural predators of bearded seals include polar bears (Burns 1981), as well as killer whales, walruses, and Greenland sharks (Kovacs 2002).","Native Peoples of the Arctic have hunted bearded seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today (Burns 1981). Overall levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. The former Soviet Union had commercial harvests in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering, Chukchi, Barents, and White Seas historically, and harvest levels were at times high. Harvest levels grew from 9,000 to 13,000 from 1957 to 1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year for the Bering and Okhotsk Seas combined from 1964-1967 (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992).  This commercial over-harvesting probably depleted the population (Kelly 1988).  Bearded seals are now harvested more on a subsistence basis for local use in Russia, although some seals are killed as food for fur-farm animals (Kelly 1988), and are primarily taken from the Bering Sea where harvests of 1,881 and 1,418 were reported for 1988 and 1989 respectively (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992).<br/><br/>Fisheries interactions appear to be low. Logbooks indicate 14 bearded seals killed and 31 injured in 1991 in the Bristol Bay, Alaska salmon drift net fishery. There were several incidents of incidental take, serious injury, or mortality each in the Alaskan Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands flatfish and pollock trawl fisheries respectively from 1999-2003, when annual mortality was estimated at 1.58 seals (Angliss and Outlaw 2005).  <br/><br/>Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect bearded seals through direct contact with oil, and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, which respond poorly to oil contamination (Kelly 1988).<br/><br/>Arctic climate change that is currently leading to reduction in the extent and duration of sea ice cover is a threat to many species of marine mammals.  Patterns of Arctic primary productivity and population levels of prey species important to Arctic marine mammals may be altered as a consequence of Arctic warming and changes in sea ice. Pinnipeds, such as the bearded seal that are dependant on sea ice for pupping, molting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Tynan and DeMaster 1997). In contrast, Stirling and Derocher (1993) suggest that climatic warming could result in more favorable conditions for bearded, harp, and harbor seals, and walruses if it causes sea ice to become less consolidated in winter, and the summer open water period to lengthen.<br/><br/>An increase in human-created noise in the Arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including bearded seals which are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997).  A reduction in sea ice cover would likely lead to increased human activity in the Arctic in the form of shipping and extractive industries, and an associated greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals (Pagnan 2000).  <br/><br/>Harp seals, hooded seals, and ringed seals from the Canadian Arctic, where they share habitat with bearded seals, were all determined to carry antibodies to phocine distemper virus (PDV), with harp seals constituting the population with the largest percentage (83%) of positive tests.  Although the disease has not been identified in bearded seals, the opportunity for exposure exists (Duignan <em>et al.</em> 1997).","The worldwide population of bearded seals is unknown (Kovacs 2002). Portions of the range have the following abundance estimates: 200,000-250,000 in the Sea of Okhotsk, including 60,000-75,000 off eastern Sakhalin Island for the period 1968 to 1990, and 250,000-300,000 in the Bering Sea, including 83,000-87,000 in the western Bering Sea (Fedoseev 2000). A minimum estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period. Angliss and Outlaw (2005) state that there are no current reliable population estimates for the Bering Chukchi stock of bearded seals. No estimates exist for the population in the Atlantic Ocean (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993), or Barents to Chukchi seas area.",Unknown,"Bearded seals have a circumpolar distribution in the Arctic and sub-Arctic south of 85 degrees North, usually in water less than 200 m deep (Kelly 1988). A disjunct population inhabits the Sea of Okhotsk, ranging south to Hokkaido, Japan (Rice 1998). They reach the southern Bering Sea and Bristol Bay to the limit of seasonally ice covered waters (Kelly 1988). They also occupy all of Hudson Bay, and range south to Southern Labrador, and northern Iceland and Norway (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Bearded seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal in the eastern North Atlantic (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts in the western North Atlantic (Gosselin and Boily 1994).<br/><br/>The ranges of the two subspecies are divided near the central Canadian Arctic in the Western Hemisphere, and Laptev Sea in the Eastern Hemisphere, with the Atlantic subspecies barbatus occurring from the central Canadian Arctic east to the central Eurasian Arctic, and Pacific subspecies nauticus occurring from the Laptev Sea east to the central Canadian Arctic, including animals in the Sea of Okhotsk (Rice 1998).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Bearded seals are protected by various laws in their range countries and by treaties internationally.  Subsistence hunting by Native People of the Arctic is generally for personal use and not regulated, for example, as in Canada and the United States (Cleator 1996, Angliss and Outlaw 2005).<br/><br/>Vessel-based commercial hunting in the former Soviet Union ended in 1975 and the harvest continues at much lower levels, more like a subsistence harvest.  Prior to the end of commercial harvesting, the Soviet Union used a system of quotas to regulate the take in an attempt to manage the population (Kelly 1988).  Licensed hunters can take bearded seals in Svalbard, but not in nature reserves or during the breeding season (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

It is assessed as Data Deficient.,"The jungle cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with the classic rainforest ""jungle"" habitat, but rather with wetlands - habitats with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments.  Hence its other common and more applicable name, the swamp cat. Water and dense ground cover can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert (where it is found near oases or along riverbeds) to grassland, shrubby woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br><br>Areas with extensive deciduous dipterocarp forest and at least scattered surface water are the species predominant known habitat in Indochina. However, areas such as the Nakai Plateau which support other forms of savanna-like vegetation may support the species. It is probably absent from all closed canopy forests, including rainforest. The species may make use of agricultural areas with a low intensity of human use and which retain patches of scrub (Duckworth <i>et al.</i>, 2005).<br><br>Jungle cats have adapted well to irrigated cultivation, having been observed in many different types of agricultural and forest plantations throughout their range, such as sugar cane plantations in India.  In Israel they can be found around pisciculture ponds and irrigation ditches.  Vereschagin (1959) noted that the jungle cat's use of the semi-arid plains of Azerbaijan increased with the development of a local irrigation system and decreased with its abandonment.  However, mowing the seasonally flooded riverine tugai vegetation (trees and shrubs with dense stands of tall reeds and grasses) of this region for livestock fodder, as well as plowing it under for agriculture, is known to be associated with the decline of jungle cat populations in the European-central Asian parts of its range (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).  <br><br>Jungle cats feed mainly on prey that weighs less than one kilogram.  Small mammals, principally rodents,  are the prey most frequently found in feces and stomach contents.  A study in India's Sariska reserve estimated that jungle cats catch and eat three to five rodent per day (Mukherjee <i>et al.</i> 2004).  Birds rank second in importance, but in southern Russia waterfowl are the mainstay of jungle cat diet in the winter.  With overwintering populations of waterfowl congretating in large numbers on unfrozen rivers and marshes, the jungle cat hunts among reeed beds and along edges of wetlands, searching for injured or weakened birds.  Other prey species are taken more opportunistically, including hares, nutria, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and fish.  In India, they have been seen to scavenge kills of large predators such as the Asiatic lion.  In a study in southern Uzbekistan, the fruits of the Russian olive made up 17% of their diet in winter.  While jungle cats specialize on small prey, they are large and powerful enough to kill young swine, subadult gazelles, and chital fawns (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).<br><br>Density estimates from natural tugai habitat in central Asia range from 4-15 individuals per 10 km², but where this vegetation type has declined due to development density does not exceed two cats per 10 km² (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).","Jungle cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker <em>et al.</em> 2003, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2005).  India formerly exported large numbers of jungle cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979), and some illegal trade continues there (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), as well as in Egypt (Glas in press) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004).","The jungle cat is considered common in some parts of its range, primarily in India (Mukherjee 1988), but also Pakistan and Bangladesh (Duckworth <i>et al.</i>, 2005).  <br><br>In southern China and southeast Asia (with the exception of northeastern Cambodia),  however, it appears quite rare in comparison to sympatric small cats (Duckworth <i>et al</i>. 2005).  This rarity appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon associated with unselective trapping and snaring, especially in Lao PDR and Thailand as well, where it was described as common by Lekagul and McNeely (1977) but has since suffered drastic declines and is rarely encountered (Duckworth <i>et al</i>. 2005; Lynam <i>et al.</i> 2006, W. Duckworth and R. Steinmetz, Southeast Asia mammal assessment 2003).<br><br>In Europe, it is of marginal occurrence, with small populations in Cis-Caspian region and the Caucasus along the Caspian Sea. The European population has been rapidly declining since the 1960s. There was no records of this species in Astrakhan State Reserve (Russian Federation) since the 1980s. In Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation) only about 150 animals were recorded (Kuryatnikov and Varziev 1983). Marked population fluctuations are characteristic of this species in this region, probably because of absence of adaptations to cold winters. Despite these fluctuations the long-term trend in Europe is of decline in both population and area of occupancy. Data from Russia suggest that there are about 500 animals left in the wild (Prisazhnyuk and Belousova 2007). A very small population persists in Georgia (I. Macharashvili pers. comm. to K. Tsysulina 2007).  This species is considered threatened in a number of range states in Europe and the Caucasus, and is included in the Red Books of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (IUCN 2007).<br><br>In southwest Asia the species is also considered rare and threatened (Abu-Baker <i>et al</i>. 2003, Habibi 2004).",Decreasing,"The jungle cat has a broad but patchy distribution.  In Africa, it is found only in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley south to Aswan, and in El Faiyum, Farafara, Dakhla and Kharga oases (Glas in press).  Into southwest Asia, it occurs through Israel, southern Lebanon, northwestern Jordan, western Syria, and into Turkey and western Iraq (Abu-Baker <em>et al.</em>, 2003).  In this region its occurrence is highly localized around riparian vegetation and permanent water sources.  In central Asia, it is found in the Caucasus mountains (up to 1,000 m), around the Caspian and Aral Seas and associated river valleys, and through Iran west to Pakistan.  It occurs widely in tropical and sub-tropical Asia, including almost all of India as well as Sri Lanka, ranging up to 2,400 m in the Himalayan foothills, and through Southeast Asia to southern China, but absent from Malayan peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).  Its range in Indochina is poorly known, especially in Myanmar.  Duckworth <em>et al.</em> (2005) review the few historical distribution records from Indochina and add several recent ones from Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam.",,Terrestrial,"The jungle cat is listed on CITES Appendix II.  It is protected from hunting in some range states (India), but in many receives no legal protection outside protected areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br><br>The ecology and status of the jungle cat is poorly known (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Southwest and Southeast Asia, where it is considered rare and declining, more research needs to be undertaken to gain knowledge of current distribution, both in and outside of protected areas (Abu-Baker <i>et al.</i> 2003, Duckworth <i>et al.</i> 2005).  Some farmers consider the jungle cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker <i>et al.</i> 2003), and conservation measures should include better protection for domestic fowl and halting of indiscriminate poisoning and trapping.  The jungle cat would also benefit from improved protection of natural wetlands and reedbeds, particularly in the more arid parts of its range, and improved legislation prohibiting fur trade.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

Other prey include ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares.  Cheetahs, unlike other African predators, rarely scavenge and do not remain long with their kills, many of which are stolen by other carnivores.  Cheetahs are primarily active during the day, unlike other predators, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are primarily found in open grassy habitats, but also make use of dry forest, savanna woodland, semi-desert and scrub, being absent from tropical rainforest.  There are reports of cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In the central Sahara, cheetahs occur in high mountain habitat - the Saharan mountains are hyper-arid, but still receive slightly higher rainfall than the surrounding desert.  They are thus better vegetated and support small permanent waterholes and antelope populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Cheetah habitat in Iran consists of desert, much of it with precipitation of fewer than 100 mm per year. The terrain ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m. The vegetation, if any, consists of a sparse cover of shrubs, most less than one meter tall, of the genera <em>Salsola</em>, <em>Artemisia</em>, <em>Zygophyllum</em>, <em>Astragulus</em>, <em>Aphaxis</em>, and others. Gazelles <em>Gazella subgutturosa</em> and <em>G. bennetti</em> were preferred prey, but they have now become scarce through over-hunting and replacement by livestock (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Opportunistic recovery of cheetah kills suggests that wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian ibex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are the key prey species today though none are considered optimal for cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among the felids.  Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three.  Some coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group.  Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, which remain attached to and mate with the females in a single pride, cheetah male coalitions mate with as many females as possible (Caro 1994), and females show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Female cheetahs in areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains) follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km²) and attempt to mate with females passing through (Durant <em>et al</em>. 1988; Caro 1994).  However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females have smaller, overlapping ranges that are similar in size (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  On Namibian farmlands, where prey is non-migratory, both cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km²); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range.  The reasons for such large home ranges were unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002).   <br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for lions, leopards, tigers and jaguars in prime habitat: Durant, 2007).  On the Serengeti plains, cheetah densities range from 0.8-1.0 per 100 km², but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km² (Caro 1994).  Caro (1994) attributes lower cheetah densities to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as lions and hyenas that can kill cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands, where lions and hyenas have been eradicated, cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km²) (Marker 2002).","In Eastern Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation was identified as the primary threat during a conservation strategy workshop (Anon. 2007).   Because cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of cheetahs (Durant 2007).<br/><br/>A depleted wild ungulate prey base is of serious concern in northern Africa (Berzins and Belbachir 2006).  Cheetahs which turn to livestock are killed as pests (Claro 2003; Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 2003; Wacher <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Conflict with farmers and depletion of the wild prey base are also considered significant threats in parts of Eastern Africa (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah <em>A. j. venaticus</em> is threatened indirectly by loss of prey base through human hunting activities. In addition, most protected areas are open to seasonal livestock grazing, which potentially places huge pressure on the resident ungulate populations through disturbance and potential competition (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, domestic dogs accompanying the herds present a likely threat to both cheetahs and their prey (H. Ziaie pers. comm. 2008)  An emerging threat is the possibility of fragmentation into discontinuous subpopulations as a result of increasing developmental pressures (mining, oil, roads, railways); this is particularly the case in Kavir N.P., currently the north-western limit of the Asiatic Cheetah's range (L. Hunter and L. Marker pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Conflict with farmers and ranchers is the major threat to cheetahs in southern Africa (Purchase <em>et al</em>. 2007).  Cheetah are often killed or persecuted because they are a perceived threat to livestock, despite the fact that they cause relatively little damage. In Namibia, very large numbers of cheetahs have been live-trapped and removed by ranchers seeking to protect their livestock (from government permit records, Nowell [1996] calculated that over 9,500 cheetahs were removed from 1978-1995).  While removal rates have fallen, in part due to intensified conservation and education efforts, many ranchers still view cheetahs as a problem animal, despite research showing that cheetahs were only responsible for 3% of livestock losses to predators (Marke, 2002). Although cheetah in Iran have been killed because of predation on livestock, since 2003, there has been no direct evidence of killing cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007), though it is likely most incidents go unreported. <br/><br/>Cheetahs are also vulnerable to being caught in snares set for other species (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>Another threat to the cheetah is interspecific competition with other large predators, especially lions. On the open, short-grass plains of the Serengeti, juvenile mortality can be as high as 95%, largely due to predation by lions (Laurenson 1994). However, mortality rates are lower in more closed habitats (Caro in press). <br/><br/>CITES allows legal trade in live animals and hunting trophies under an Appendix I quota system (annual quotas: Namibia - 150; Zimbabwe - 50; Botswana - 5).  This was accepted by CITES as a way to enhance the economic value of cheetahs on private lands and provide an economic incentive for their conservation (Nowell 1996).  The global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining; cheetahs breed poorly in captivity and in 2001 30% of the captive population was wild-caught (Marker 2002).  While analysis of trade records in the CITES database shows that these countries have reported almost no live exports since the late 1990s, Purchase <em>et al.</em> (2007) are concerned that there is a substantial illegal cross-border trade in live animals.  There is also concern about illegal trade in skins, as well as capture of live cubs for trade to the Middle East (Anon. 2007).  There is an increasing trade in cubs from north-east Africa into the Middle East (Amir 2005),  but there is currently little trade in cubs from the Sahel region, where it was previously considered a major problem (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are active during the daytime and there is concern that they can be driven off their kills by tourist cars crowding around, or mothers separated from their cubs.  Burney (1980) conducted a study and concluded that tourist cars did not seem to harm cheetahs, and in fact sometimes helped, as cheetah chases more often ended in a kill when there were cars around, distracting prey, providing cover from which to stalk, or otherwise waking cheetahs up to notice prey in the area.  However, tourist numbers have risen sharply by then, and its potential impact on cheetahs remains a concern (Caro 1994; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>The Eastern African cheetah conservation strategy (Anon. 2007) identified four sets of constraints to mitigating these threats across a large spatial scale.  Political constraints include lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability in some ecologically important areas, and lack of political will to foster cheetah conservation.  Economic constraints include lack of financial resources to support conservation, and lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife.  Social constraints include negative conceptions of cheetahs, lack of capacity to achieve  conservation, lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes leading to subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation.  These potentially mutable human constraints contrast with several biological constraints which are characteristic of cheetahs and cannot be changed, including wide-ranging behaviour, negative interactions with other large carnivores, and potential susceptibility to disease.<br/><br/>Disease is a potential threat to the cheetah (Anon. 2007), as its reduced genetic diversity can increase a population's susceptibility  (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1983).  However, the most serious disease mortality thus far documented in wild cheetahs was from naturally occurring anthrax in Namibia's Etosha National Park; cheetahs, unlike other predators, do not scavenge carcasses of ungulates killed by anthrax, and thus had no built-up immunity when they preyed upon springbok sick with the disease (Lindeque <em>et al</em>. 1998).  The cheetah's low density may offer some measure of protection against infectious disease; for example, cheetahs were not affected by an outbreak of Canine Distemper Virus in the Serengeti National Park which killed over 1/3 of the lion population.  Serological surveys of cheetahs on Namibian farmland indicate some exposure and survival of the disease (Marker 2002).","Southern Africa is the cheetah's regional stronghold, with a ""roughly"" estimated population of at least 4,500 adults (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).  This regional estimate breaks down as follows:  Angola - present but unknown; Botswana - 1,800; Malawi - &lt;25 (and probably extirpated: Purchase and Purchase 2007); Mozambique: &lt;50; Namibia - 2,000; South Africa - 550; Zambia - 100; Zimbabwe - 400.  A large proportion of the estimated population lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game, and where lions and hyenas have been extirpated.<br/><br/>The number of known resident cheetahs in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents.  Most population estimates were derived from applying a density estimate of one adult per 100 km² to mapped resident range areas during a conservation strategy workshop, although a few are based on research.  Only four of the 15 known populations were estimated to number &gt;200 animals; the largest population (Serengeti/Maro/Tsavo in Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 710.  It would be much smaller if unprotected lands were included.  Overall, less than half of the estimated cheetah population inhabits protected areas.  In addition, approximately half lives in habitat blocks which are trans-boundary, requiring international cooperation for conservation of the population.  Cheetahs possibly occur over an area which is several times as large as the range of the known population (Anon. 2007).  <br/><br/>These estimates can be compared with previous population estimates based on extensive field interviews and application of density estimates.  There is rough accord for Kenya at 793 (Gros 1998) and Tanzania at 569-1,007 (Gros 2002).  However, in Uganda, Gros and Rejmanek (1999) estimated 40-295 with a wider range in the Karamoja region, whereas now cheetahs have been extirpated and just 12 are estimated to persist in Kidepo National Park and surroundings (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In the remainder of Africa, there are few reliable population estimates.  Cheetahs are considered extinct or possibly extinct in many countries (Marker 2002).  In northwest Africa the population is probably fewer than 250 mature individuals and the subspecies A. j. heckii is listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>In Asia cheetahs are now known to exist only in Iran, where the subspecies A. j. venaticus is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007) and listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>The known cheetah population is not much greater than 7,000, and the total population is unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, thus meeting the criteria for Vulnerable.  The current known population is half the 15,000 estimated by Myers (1975) from his continental status assessment.  The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) could be less than half of the total population (Kelly 2001). <br/><br/>While the current rate of population decline is of most concern, and the historical rate of decline has been severe (Nowell and Jackson, 1996; Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005), attention has also focused on the cheetah's having perhaps suffered even more extreme losses in the distant past.  The cheetah species exhibits remarkably low levels of genetic diversity in comparison to other felids (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1986) (but not compared to carnivores in general: Merola 1994).  This is consistent with inbreeding among a very few individuals surviving one or more catastrophic population bottlenecks in the past, with the first possibly occurring during the late Pleistocene extinctions, around 10,000 years ago, according to analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien 1995).  <br/><br/>It is unclear what sort of agent could have caused such an extreme population decline in a wide-ranging species, and alternative explanations have been explored.  Hedrick (1996) suggested the low levels of genetic variation could result from a very low effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population that is actually passing on its genes), and Kelly's (2001) calculations of effective population size in cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains were quite low (44% or less of the actual population).  She found that only a few females contributed disproportionately to future generations by raising offspring which survived and reproduced (Kelly 2001).  Genetic analysis by Gottelli <em>et al.</em> (2007) showed that male cheetahs, on the other hand, passed on their genes more successfully than expected.  Female cheetahs mated with multiple males, many non-resident, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity.  This indicates that rates of genetic loss should be lower than anticipated by Kelly (2001), and underscores the importance of cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.   <br/><br/>While the causes of the cheetah's low levels of genetic variation are unclear, what is clear is that large populations are necessary to conserve it.  Since cheetahs are a low density species, conservation areas need to be quite large, larger than most protected areas.",Stable,"Cheetahs have disappeared from huge areas of their historic range.  They still occur widely, but sparsely, in Africa, but Ray <em>et al.</em> (2005) estimate that the cheetahs have disappeared from 76% of their historic range on the continent.<br/><br/>In Asia, the cheetah has lost almost all its vast historic range, which within the last century extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Habibi 2004; Mallon 2007).  Part of the reason for their disappearance in Asia is live captures of cheetahs, which were trained to hunt for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh, 1995).  The main cause, however, was likely depletion of the wild prey base, especially gazelles, as well as direct killing of cheetahs and development of their habitat (Mallon, 2007).  The Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered.  Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001).  While Habibi (2004) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, a cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, although there has been significant range loss in parts of these regions.  Cheetahs are known to occur only in 6% of their historical range in Eastern Africa (310,586 km²), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (Anon. 2007).  Current distribution in several countries remains largely unknown (Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Angola, Mozambique and Zambia).  Cheetahs are known to be extirpated from large areas in Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi (Anon. 2007, 2008).  In some parts of southern Africa they occur extensively outside protected areas on commercial ranch land where other large predators (lions and hyenas) have been extirpated (Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe) (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined most drastically in northern and western Africa (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).  The subspecies (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information on northwest Africa.  <br/><br/>Cheetah persistence in the eastern Sahara is unlikely.<br/><br/>Cheetahs are possibly extinct in Libya. Specimens were previously collected near the Egyptian border (northeastern part of the country), in Dahra, Sirtica (north-central), Bir Ghazal and Hamada-el-Homra (northwestern). Other records include Fezzan, Khor-el-Gifa, Gikherra (eastern), El Ftaia (near coastal area) and Mizda (Hufnagl 1972). Myers (1975) mentioned that cheetahs were noted in Niger/Libyan borders as well as Niger/Algerian borders. An inquiry with local Tuaregs suggested that the species might not longer be present in Akoukas Mountains (J.-L. Bernezat pers. comm. 2007).  <br/><br/>In Tunisia, cheetahs were formerly reported to roam in sandy expanses south of Chott-el-Djerid, the desert areas south of Foum Tatahouine and the Grand Erg Occidental and its surroundings (Schomber and Kock 1960). There are no recent records on the species in the country which make it presumably extinct. The El-Borma region, near the Algerian boundaries, was probably among the areas where cheetahs have last been seen in 1974 and documented (Louis 1979).  <br/><br/>As far as Egypt is concerned, data collated during the last few decades suggest that cheetahs are extremely rare, if not extinct, in the country. Osborn and Helmy (1980) provided original and literature-based records from the Matrouh Governorate and Sinai. According to Saleh <em>et al</em>. (2001), cheetahs became extinct from most of the Mediterranean coastal region and easily accessible inland habitats of El-Maghra and Siwa oases one decade after being widely distributed in the northern Egyptian Western Desert until the 1970s. The main reasons explaining cheetah extirpation have been attributed to extensive and uncontrolled hunting and the development of coastal lands (Saleh <em>et al</em>. 2001). If not completely vanished, the species is believed to be confined, with a very low density, to the Western Desert and around the Qattara Depression (Saleh <em>et al</em>., 2001; Hoath, 2003). Recent records from North Sinai, including one female and three cubs killed by Bedouin hunters in 1993, as well as one female seen with two cubs in November 1994, have not been verified (Hoath 2003). <br/><br/>In the eastern Sahel and central Africa, there is little current information:<br/><br/>Current cheetah distribution in most of its historic range in Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia are unknown (Anon. 1997).  In Chad, although cheetahs were still present and seen occasionally in Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim in the 1970s (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008). A recent wildlife survey in western and central Chad, including Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve, conducted by the Sahelo-Saharan Interest Group in 2001, failed to detect any cheetah presence in the region (Monfort <em>et al</em>. 2003). In the Central Saharan (northern) part of the country, cheetahs still occur, in very low density, in and around the Ennedi Massif (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008 based on Rava's pers. comm.). There is no information on previously reported populations in the Tibesti Mountains (Central Sahara). In southeastern Chad, cheetahs may still survive to date in Zakouma National Park (population still present in the protected area as of 2006 [N. Vanherle pers. comm. 2008]). <br/><br/>In central Africa, current cheetah distribution in the savanna regions of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo is unknown (Marker 2002).  It is considered extinct in Rwanda and Burundi, and possibly extinct in Nigeria.  Rosevear (1974) underlined the paucity of positive records for Nigeria and mentioned Lake Chad, Yan Tumaki (Katsina Division) and possibly Bauchi Plateau as localities for three specimens kept in the British Museum. Happold (1987) raised the possibility of their occurrence near Cameroonian boundaries, and also in the Yankari Game Reserve (Happold 1987). Recent reports from protected area managers and wildlife traders indicate that a threatened small cheetah population may still range in restricted areas in north-centre and northeastern parts of the country (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2008).","Cheetahs are hunted for sport and trophies, as well as handicrafts products. Live animals are also traded - the global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining. Pest animals are also removed.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson, 1996. However, a number of countries permit cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock (Purchase <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  In Namibia, for example, one is permitted to retain the skin as long as the killing is reported  (Nowell, 1996).  Such policies may at least permit cheetah killing to be monitored.<br/><br/>Promotion of livestock management regimes which minimize conflict with cheetahs are an important conservation measure, pioneered by the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia (Marker <em>et al.</em>, 2003) but now being applied more widely.  Elements of successful conservation management include availability of wild prey and more intensive livestock herd protection, especially using guard dogs.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Cheetah is protected in Iran. The main protected areas for this species include Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park and Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh P.A., and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge. A radio-telemetry study in Iran is providing the first detailed data on cheetahs in Iran (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Several countries, including Namibia and Kenya, have developed national action plans or conservation strategies for cheetahs (Nowell, 1996; Durant, 2007); regional conservation strategies have been developed for Southern (Dickman <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Anon., 2008) and Eastern Africa (Anon., 2007); and there is also a global strategy (Bartels <em>et al.</em>, 2002).  These plans call for a number of improvements in monitoring, surveys and information exchange (to better understand cheetah distribution and status); promotion of human-cheetah coexistence (to reduce conflict and develop incentives to conserve cheetahs); national land use planning (to ensure viable national cheetah populations); capacity building (to improve management); policy and legislation (to ensure legal consistency and remove loopholes) and advocacy (to raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation needs).<br/><br/>Several specialist networks of cheetah conservationists have been established, including the Global Cheetah Forum (affiliated with the IUCN Conservation Breeding Specialist Group) and the North African Regional Cheetah Action Group (NARCAG/OGRAN).  The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (www.catsg.org)<br/><br/>Important protected areas that represent strongholds for Cheetah populations in Africa include the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa, Botswana), Nxai Pan and Chobe National Parks, and Okavango Delta (Botswana), Etosha N.P. (Namibia), Liuwa Plains N.P. (Zambia), and, of course, the Serengeti N.P. (Tanzania, Kenya) (Caro in press). In West Africa, the major remaining stronghold for the species is the WAPO protected areas complex. There is a surviving population of Cheetah in the Ahaggar National Park in Algeria (Wacher <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>However, most cheetah occur outside of protected areas (where they are often persecuted as pests), and given their need for large areas they require conservation action on a landscape scale (for example, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, zoning for land-use to maintain habitat connectivity, and wild prey restoration) (Marker, 2002; Anon., 2007).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

Congo Clawless Otters have been protected by the remoteness of the Congo forest and the difficulty of catching them. However, firearms are growing in prevalence in the region, providing a possible 10-fold increase in hunters’ success rate over traditional practices (Levi <em>et al</em>. 2009). Road-building opening up the forest for timber exploitation and construction of large hydroelectric projects could also reduce the protection afforded to date.<br/><br/>Habitat loss by direct causes (clearing, inundation) and indirect causes (pollution, invasive species introduction) and competition for fisheries is increasing with the growing human population in concert with declining returns from an unsustainable bushmeat trade (Wilkie <em>et al</em>. 2005). These combined factors predict a severe reduction of otter habitat and populations. Increased global temperature and resultant climate change may also increase periods of drought, with additional losses to otter populations (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011). Consequently, all African otter species are likely to be more affected in the next 20 years (generation length 6.5 as proposed by Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thus the species isassessed as Near Threatened based on a suspected 25% decline over the next three generations due to the expected decline in habitat quality and other threats to the species. It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A3cde; this is a precautionary listing.","<p>The Congo Clawless Otter occurs in rain forests and lowland swamps of the Congo River basin (Lariviere 2001, Jacques <em>et al.</em> 2009). They are observed in swampy forest clearings (bais), for example, at Langoué Bai in Gabon, and Mbeli Bai in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (N.P.) and in Odzala N.P. in the Republic of the Congo (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009). They also inhabit some rivers, for example Dji Dji River (Gabon) (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011), and Sanaga River (Cameroon) (Jacques 2006). They are recorded up to 2,200 m on the Kahuzi Massif (Rahm and Christiaensen 1963). With one exception (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011), all records report the presence of only one young with the mother (Jacques 2002b).</p>","<em>Aonyx congicus</em> may not be under threat where the forest is still well preserved&#160; (Gabon and parts of Congo). Nevertheless, road opening for wood exploitation could adversely affect the sustainable use of the forest with hunters using these roads for their illegal activities. Deforestation has dramatically increased in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and will probably be an even bigger problem in future. As a result of the high human density, lakes and rivers are subjected to pollutants from human activities such as washing, agricultural run-off and soil erosion.<br/><br/>Overfishing has become a critical threat to otter populations as fish community structure has been decimated across the central Congo Basin. Fishes contribute from 23 to 50 per cent of the animal protein trade in Central Africa (<a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm</a>) and studies of morphometric measurements have documented the evidence of widespread overfishing for human consumption.<br/><br/>In addition to escalation of hunting for bushmeat and skins, habitat loss and degradation, and overfishing, otter populations in Central Africa are also susceptible to pressure from the development of hydro-electric power projects, under-representation of otter habitat in Protected Areas, fishermen using nylon fishing nets, a growing prevalence of arms and munitions, as well as a dramatic decline in other species (such as the Common Hippopotamus) that contribute to the aquatic-ecosystem functioning and which support otter food supplies. Some of these threats are major, but more important is the dramatic combined effect of threats on the otters.<br/><br/>The Congo Clawless Otter seems to average one pup in a litter and may abandon any area of occupancy with high human activity.&#160; In one study on the Dji Dji River in Gabon (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2011), reproductive Congo Clawless Otters disappeared from a site previously observed to harbour high densities of the species (alongside <em>Hydrictis maculicollis</em> which did decline to the same degree). Low rainfall in the previous wet season was thought to be the reason, but nothing is known about the adaptability of otters, their seasonal movements or the whereabouts of Congo Clawless Otters in response to drought conditions. As global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of droughts, these conditions may impact survival and reproduction of the species in the future.<br/><p></p>","<p>This is a very poorly known species. It may be common in certain undisturbed rainforest locations, but is otherwise thought to be rare to very rare (Jacques <em>et al. </em>2009). In certain places, locals attest that they see fewer “big otters” (<em>A. congicus</em> versus <em>H</em><em>. maculicollis</em>) (Jacques 2002b,c; Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2002a; Jacques 2003, 2006; Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011). A number of documented cases of <em>A. congicus</em> (including mother and cub) being killed by locals in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo would suggest that although otters are rarely seen and are difficult to catch, otter populations may suffer from hunting pressure in Congo Basin (Jacques 2002b). This will likely increase in the future as human population grows and preferred bushmeat species become scarce.</p>",Decreasing,"The Congo Clawless Otter occurs in the rainforests of the Congo basin including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as southern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic, northern Angola, and extending eastward to the forests and the wetlands of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Larivière 2001, Jacques <em>et al.</em> 2009). The limits of the species’ distribution range are still unclear, partly due to the species’ possible confusion with the Cape Clawless Otter; there are, as yet, no confirmed records from Nigeria (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Otters are occasionally hunted for meat, but have the reputation of being quite difficult to catch. They are seldom recorded in bushmeat reports (S. Lahm and A.Willox pers. comms., Jacques 2002b). The price is quite similar to other bushmeat. While meat is sought after in Congo and Cameroon, this is not the case in Gabon.<br/><br/>Moreover, in Gabon, otters are sometimes considered dangerous, giving an electrical shock when caught with a spear. In Central and West Africa, their meat has the reputation of being an aphrodisiac (as it is with many other species). In some areas, the otter is said to possess magical powers: by wearing a piece of fur one can become invisible to an opponent, or escape an enemy as otters escape fish traps.<br/><br/>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), killing has exponentially increased over the recent decade with the proliferation of weapons and munitions, making the shooting of otters from pirogues and the river bank much more common (Thompson pers. comm.). Skins of <em>A. congicus </em>are used in Cameroon to make drums (Alary <em>et al</em>. 2001). According to Carpaneto and Germi (1989), Mbuti pygmies in northeastern DRC use the skins of Congo Clawless Otters to make hats.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Congo Clawless Otter is present in several protected areas across their range, including Dzanga-Sangha N.P. in Central African Republic, Ivindo Gabon, and Nouabalé-Ndoki and Odzala National Parks in Congo Republic (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009). Thus they are incidentally conserved with other target species..It is listed on CITES Appendix II (as <em>Aonyx capensis</em>). Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled. There is a need for a detailed study on the biology, ecology, and distribution of this species.<br/><br/>In addition to threats already cited, Congo Clawless Otters likely to suffer from a general lack of awareness of their presence and conservation needs by the institutions in charge of wildlife conservation in most African countries. The initiative of the Wildlife Conservation Society to include otters in their document ‘Setting conservation and research priorities for larger African carnivores’ (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005) could aid in greater awareness and promotion of more research on African otters. Otters could be used as symbols of water quality and preservation, and this may contribute to environmental education.

14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In the north of its range,<em> Saguinus midas</em> occurs in French Guiana, Suriname and Guyana (Husson 1957), but is largely restricted to the east of the Essequibo River (Norconk <em>et al</em>. 1996).

There had been no reports of callitrichids occurring in Venezuela (Handley 1976, Bodini and Pérez-Hernández 1987), until Linares (1998) indicated its occurrence in eastern Bolívar.

Geladas are poor tree-climbers and are almost entirely terrestrial, partly a consequence of their unusual dietary specialization as a grazer (Dunbar 1983).<br/><br/>Geladas feed primarily on the leaves of graminoids (grasses and sedges) and also forbs (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). They also excavate and consume subterranean foods including roots, corms, tubers and rhizomes (Fashing <em>et al</em>. 2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey<em> et al.</em> 2018), especially during the dry season when green vegetation is less abundant (Fashing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). Invertebrates are eaten opportunistically (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2010, 2014), and cereal crops may be taken where agriculture encroaches onto the Geladas' habitat (Abu <em>et al. </em>2018, Jarvey <em>et al</em>. 2018).","<p>The overall range of the Gelada is being eroded by agricultural expansion resulting from rapid human population growth in the Ethiopian highlands. Conversion of Gelada habitat to farmland and livestock grazing is common (Bergman and Beehner 2013) and soil erosion is a serious problem throughout the region (Nyssen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grazing pressure is intense, and competition from domestic livestock has forced the Gelada to remain on the less productive gorge slopes in some areas (e. g. eastern Arsi) (Abu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gelada densities are considerably lower in heavily populated areas than in undisturbed habitats (R. Burke, pers. obs.).</p>  <p>Geladas are also harassed, shot or hunted with dogs as crop pests (R. Burke, pers. obs.) and occasionally sold locally as pets (Bergman and Beehner 2013). In the past, Geladas were trapped for zoos though this practice no longer occurs. Also, in the past, adult male numbers were reduced as a result of selective shooting for their capes of hair, which were made into ceremonial costumes used by the Oromo people (Dunbar 1977). The extent of this practice today is unknown. There are also historic records of Gelada capes being made into fur hats for tourists (Dunbar 1977).</p>  <p>Government-sanctioned trophy hunting of Geladas by tourists is currently allowed in controlled hunting areas, although the extent and impact of this practice are unknown.</p>  <p>Parasitic swellings caused by tapeworms (<em>Taenia serialis</em>) are a major cause of death in some Gelada populations (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2015, Schneider-Crease <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>Climate change poses a long-term threat to Geladas, especially for populations inhabiting higher elevations, where agriculture has previously been impossible or uncommon (Dunbar 1998).</p>","<p>Geladas are widespread throughout much of their present range, although they are probably not as abundant as they were in the 1970s, when an aerial survey of the central Ethiopian Highlands yielded a population estimate of 440,000 individuals (Dunbar 1977). A concurrent alternative estimate based on known ground densities from a small proportion of the Gelada’s geographic range and the total area of gorge face on the plateau yielded a figure of 884,000 (Dunbar 1977). Detailed ground surveys at five sites yielded overall densities varying between 15 and 69 animals/km², although densities of animals within their home ranges typically reached 70–80/km² (Dunbar 1977). A recent estimate for what is believed to be the largest remaining population of Geladas, in and around Simien Mountains National Park, was ~4,300 individuals, down from ~10,000 individuals in the 1970s (Beehner <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bergman and Beehner 2013).</p><p>While recent habitat conversion to farming and grazing lands has undoubtedly adversely affected the Afroalpine grassland habitats of Geladas (Fashing and Nguyen 2016), only further comprehensive surveys will reveal the extent to which Gelada populations across the highlands have changed since the 1970s.</p>",Decreasing,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Theropithecus gelada</em>&#160;is restricted to Afroalpine grasslands adjacent to deep gorges and cliffs in the Provinces of Tigray, Begemdir (Gondar), Wollo, Shoa and Arsi at altitudes between 1,800 and 4,400 m asl (Jablonski 2005, Gippoliti 2010).

This program included a schools lecture and nature walk initiative to promote conservation awareness among the next generation of environmental stewards. It also included vocational training programs for adults to improve their opportunities for employment and income generation. The needs of community elders were addressed as well, through a health clinics initiative that provided medicines for old age problems like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and spectacles and free cataract surgery for seniors with visual impairments. The success of this program led to its replication at a locality within the range of <span class=""MsoPageNumber""><em>S. v. monticola</em><span class=""MsoPageNumber""> where a reforestation project and initiatives to prevent firewood extraction from natural habitats were also underway. While conservation actions during the past six years were limited to two areas, several newspaper articles were published to promote conservation awareness throughout the country. <br/><br/>Future conservation actions will include field surveys of the known ranges of all four subspecies with the objective of identifying two or more sites within each range that could be developed as protected areas. The above-mentioned activities will then be launched in nearby communities, and people will also be trained in protected area administration and management, nature guiding and interpretation, small business management and other vocations that help to promote the sustainable use of their protected area under the supervision of the government’s Department of Wildlife Conservation. Efforts to mitigate human-monkey conflicts with active participation of local communities will also be an important component of future conservation actions.<br/><br/>Active participation of local communities in managing and deriving sustainable benefits from natural habitats is a new concept in Sri Lanka. It was presented and discussed during two workshops where it received favourable responses from government authorities and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, this idea has been incorporated into a Conservation Action Plan for all Sri Lankan monkey species that is currently being developed according to IUCN guidelines. When this Action Plan is completed it will be submitted to the Sri Lankan government and the IUCN for approval.<br/><br/>While a sensible conservation action plan has been developed its implementation will depend a great deal on political will, financial support and many unknowns about people and their environment. Therefore, even with unfettered financial and political support it may take several years to bring this action plan to fruition. However, a start has been made with the hope that the threat of endangerment and extinction of the Purple-faced Langur will be eliminated as soon as possible.<span class=""MsoPageNumber""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

They can be found in disturbed habitats and in fragments with secondary forest, but as seed predators of large forest tree species (notably of the family Lecythidaceae), they tend to be in higher densities in mature forest. One possible explanation for their very large geographic distribution as a genus and as a species is their ability to use a range of forest types, from várzea to igapó to terra firma (Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Sakis are the smallest of the pitheciines, but are larger than other non-prehensile-tailed platyrrhines (<em>Aotus</em>, <em>Saimiri</em>, <em>Callicebus </em>and the Callitrichinae). Adults weigh 1.5–4.0 kg, but show a wide range in total body length (250–980 mm) and tail length (255–545 mm), reflecting the diversity between different taxa. Their tails are usually as long as the body, but in many species tails can be longer (&gt;100 mm; based on museum specimen data) in males and females. Size dimorphism is not striking but, depending on the species, females tend to be lighter in weight and smaller in overall size. Sakis are characterized by their long, coarse, fluffy hair that easily piloerects when they are approached in the wild, making them look bigger than they actually are. The hairs on the tail tend to be longer than on the back, but this varies among species, and the tail hair also ‘puffs up’ as a threat. Hairs on the trunk are always longer than those on the forearms and hind limbs. Underbellies are very lightly covered or bare. Coronal hairs are directed forward as a hood, and, depending on the species, overlap the facial region making them appear to have ‘bangs’. Both males and females have distinct throat glands for scent marking, with varying development depending on the species. Some males have obvious neck folds but others only a bare skin patch. Sakis are frugivorous seed predators (sakis are morphologically specialized for seed predation), but they eat insects such as army ants, as well as spiders, and other arthropods. Otherwise, their diet comprises seeds, fruit pulp, young leaves, insects and flowers. They vocalize in grunts, chirps, whistles, and low calls, but can be exceptionally quiet when sneaking away from a perceived threat such as a field researcher.<br/><br/>Movement Patterns: Locomotion consists of quadrupedal walking/ running, climbing and leaping. Members of this genus form small groups (2-9 individuals) which in some species may resemble a loose “fission-fusion” (Marsh pers. observ.) but core groups generally comprise a single male-female breeding pair and several young. Day ranges (1.5-2 km) and home ranges (10-25 km2) are small. Sakis exhibit behaviours associated with territory defence (Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Congregatory: Amazonian sakis are frequently seen in association (travelling, feeding and resting) with other primates such as <em>Callicebus</em>, <em>Alouatta</em>, <em>Ateles</em>, <em>Saimri</em>, <em>Saguinus</em>, <em>Lagothrix </em>(Marsh pers. observ.).","The main threats to <em>Pithecia milleri</em> are continued habitat loss, subsistence hunting and the associated live capture of young animals for the pet trade.","The population of this species is declining due to large-scale habitat loss and hunting in its distribution range. It is suspected that the population will decline by at least 30% over 30 years (2017-2047), based on accelerated rates of habitat loss within its Colombian range, in combination with continued subsistence hunting and associated live capture for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"In Colombia, <em>Pithecia milleri</em> is distributed from the foothills up to 500–700 m asl, from the surroundings of Florencia, east to the area of La Macarena, and south of the Rio Caqueta at least to Puerto Leguizamo. It is unclear where exactly the boundary with <em>P. hirsuta</em> lies (somewhere near Mecaya). According to Defler (2004) it occurs in the La Paya National Natural Park (422,000 ha) in Colombia. South of the Rio Putumayo it extends into Ecuador north of the Rio Napo but it is unclear how far it reaches east between the Napo and Putumayo Rivers. Since Miller’s sakis have been recorded in Cuyabeno in Ecuador, it might be possible that they could occur across the border west into Peru in the Zona Reservada Güeppi, north of the Rio Napo. However, until to date, there have been no records for that region.","All saki species are subject to hunting throughout their range. They are often hunted for the pet trade, and occasionally for decoration or outfits, such as hats.",Terrestrial,"This species occurs in protected areas of Ecuador and Colombia, including the following:<br/><ul><li>Colombia:&#160; La Macarena National Park (6,058 km<sup>2</sup>)</li><li>Ecuador:&#160; Cuyabeno National Park (6,034 km<sup>2</sup>)</li></ul>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
18567364,10103,Hippopotamus amphibius,Vulnerable,A4acd,2017,2016-06-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The 2008&#160;Red List Assessment&#160;described the Common Hippopotamus (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) populations as Vulnerable, as the population experienced considerable declines in the mid 1990s and early 2000s. The most recent population estimates suggest that, over the 8 years since the last assessment, Common Hippo populations have largely remained stable. The 2008&#160;Red List Assessment&#160;estimated Hippo populations to be approximately 125,000 and 148,000, with half of the 29 countries in which Common Hippos were found reporting declines. Our current assessment yields a lower population estimate, on the order of 115,000-130,000&#160;Hippos. However, we believe that the observed downward shift in total population size likely reflects overestimated population sizes from some countries in the 2008&#160;Red List Assessment&#160;that have now been corrected. Because of this, a change in the Risk Category classification of Common Hippos is not warranted at this time. The conservation status of Hippos remains precarious and the need for direct conservation action to protect Hippos and Hippo habitat across their range is a priority. Although in some countries Hippo populations have stabilized, Hippo population declines are still reported in many countries. The growing and unabated threats of habitat loss and unregulated hunting are major challenges to Hippo population viability and persistence.","As its name suggests, the Common Hippopotamus is an amphibious creature, which spends the day in water and emerges at night to feed. The Hippopotamus uses the water only as a retreat and typically does not eat aquatic vegetation, rather they forage on grass at varying distances from a water source. Hippos rely on a range of water sources – rivers, lakes, and wetlands although seasonally the animal can survive in muddy wallows.&#160; Hippos require some form of permanent water particularly in the dry season as their skin must remain moist and will crack if exposed to the air for long periods. The skin physiology is complex and not fully understood but is clearly adapted for an amphibious existence. Hippos secrete a red liquid from subdermal glands which is thought to function as both a sunscreen and antibiotic (Saikawa&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>Common Hippos are gregarious, social, polygymous animals when resting in water by day, with herd sizes ranging from the tens to a hundred. The social habits of the species have been studied by Klingel (1991), who found that the ""schools"" are groups of females and juveniles. The social system is based on mating territoriality. Females become sexually mature between the ages of 7–9, and males 9–11. Females typically bear a single offspring every other year as lactation can extend for 18 months or longer. In captivity, reproductive activity and sexual maturity occurs in younger individuals. Territorial males monopolize a length of the shoreline of the river or lake but tolerate bachelors within the territory provided they behave submissively. Non-breeding males also settle outside territorial areas, especially seasonal wallows. Fights for the possession of a territory can be fierce and the animals may inflict considerable damage on each other with their huge canines but minor conflicts are usually settled by threat displays, of which the ""yawn"" is the most conspicuous. Territorial males do not normally fight each other and severe fights usually occur only when a bachelor challenges a territorial male for control of its territory. There is little association between animals when they are feeding at night, except between females and their dependent young, and the males do not then behave in a territorial fashion. <br/><br/>The male Common Hippo, rarely the female, spreads its dung by wagging its tail vigorously while defecating, both in the water and on land, where it is thought to have a signalling rather than a territorial function. The dung piles may serve to orient Hippos or may mark territories.<br/><br/>Vocalizations take the form of complex bellows and grunts, which presumably have a signalling function. Sounds may be made either on land or in the water and may be transmitted simultaneously through air and water. This is the only known case of amphibious calls in a mammal.<br/><br/>It is likely that thermoregulation has determined the nocturnal feeding habits of the animal. Hippos typically leave wallow or pool soon after sunset and spend night hours grazing on short grass swards for up to several kilometres from water. The distance animals travel to grazing areas likely varies seasonally and among different areas. Grazing areas, which are kept short by the activities of the Hippopotamus, are often referred to as Hippo lawns. Although Hippos can graze every night, there are usually animals present in the water all night, as some return after a few hours and others leave later. Mothers with very young calves represent the only apparent social structure at grazing areas&#160; as there is no clear organization at the grazing lawn.The animal feeds by plucking the grass with its wide, muscular lips and passing it to the back of the mouth to be ground up by the molars. The front teeth (incisors and canines) play no part in feeding. The amount of food ingested is small relative to the size of the animal but its resting habits by day reduce its energetic demands and food may be retained in the gut longer than most large herbivores. The stomach is a complex four-chambered structure with ruminant-type digestion although Hippos are not true ruminants and do not chew the cud.The ecological requirements for Hippopotamus, therefore, include a supply of permanent or seasonal water, and adequate grazing on open grassland within a few kilometres of the aquatic habitat.","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The primary threats to Common Hippos are habitat loss or degradation and illegal and unregulated hunting for meat and ivory (found in the canine teeth).</p><p>Habitat loss and conflict with agricultural development and farming are a major problem for hippo conservation in many countries (Brugière <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kanga 2013, Kendall 2013, Brugière and Scholte 2013). Common Hippo’s reliance on fresh water habitats appears to put them at odds with human populations and adds to their vulnerability, given the growing pressure on fresh water resources across Africa (WWC 2004). Habitat loss stems from water diversion related to agricultural development (Cole 1992, Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993, Viljoen 1995, Viljoen and Biggs 1998) as well as larger-scale development in and around wetland areas (Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993, Harrison<em> et al. </em>2007). In many West and Central African countries, habitat loss has contributed to a growing regional threat of population fragmentation, as isolated and small populations of hippos are confined to protected areas, with poor or even no management and increasing pressure from local communities (Brugière and Scholte 2013).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">&#160;</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Reports of human mortalities from Common Hippo interactions have also increased in recent years, another indication of habitat loss. In some agricultural areas, hippo population increases in restricted habitat has also fueled conflict (Kanga 2013). Ten countries reported growing numbers of hippo-human conflicts, in several cases exacerbated by drought conditions. Conflicts with fishermen and gold miners have also been reported (Mackie <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mozambique).&#160; In many countries where Common Hippos are found, populations are not confined to protected areas. Although it is likely that the majority of the overall Common Hippo population reside in some form of protected area (national park, biosphere, game or forest reserve, sanctuary, conservation area), the proportion of protected Hippos likely varies among countries. For countries with a high proportion of Hippo populations outside protected areas, the likelihood of persistence is much lower as there is no impediment to hunting or incentive for habitat protection.<br/> <br/> </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Illegal or unregulated hippo hunting has been found to be particularly high in areas of civil unrest (Kayanja 1989, Shoumatoff 2000, Hillman Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003). At the beginning of 21st century, field surveys found that Common Hippo populations in DR Congo have declined more than 95% as a result of intense hunting pressure, during more than eight years of civil unrest and fighting (Hillman Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003). Similarly, hippo hunting by military forces during civil war in Mozambique during 1980-1992 resulted in decline of more than 70% of the hippo population in the country (Mackie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Widespread poaching for meat has also been reported from Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ivory Coast, and South Sudan (Associated Press 2003, Dibloni 2010, H. Rainey pers. comm.) as well as from politically stable countries like Zambia (Wilbroad and Milanzi 2010). Estimates of the amount of Hippo ivory illegally exported were found to be increasing in the 2008 RLA. A 1994 assessment by TRAFFIC, the monitoring agency of international trade for the IUCN, reported that illegal trade in Hippo ivory increased sharply following the international elephant ivory ban in 1989. Between 1991-1992, approximately 27,000 kg of hippo canine teeth were exported, an increase of 15,000 kg from 1989–1990 estimates (Weiler <em>et al</em>. 1994). In 1997, more than 1,700 Hippo teeth en route from Uganda to Hong Kong were seized by customs officials in France (TRAFFIC 1997). Five thousand kilos of Hippo teeth (from an estimated 2,000 Hippos) of unknown origins were exported from Uganda in 2002 (New Vision 2002). Seizure records of illegal ivory in 2007 and 2008 corroborate that this trend continues as Hippo teeth and products from Hippo teeth have been consistently found with seized ivory and ivory products from elephant tusks. </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/> Although there are several ongoing research projects in captive facilities and with wild populations, little research has focused directly on common hippo conservation. Muwanika <em>et al</em>. (2003) considered the genetic consequences of the intense unregulated hunting that occurred in Uganda in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on both nuclear and mitochondrial data, they conclude that although populations were reduced to 70% of initial population size, their current levels of genetic diversity are substantial and not a cause for concern. This suggests that for some populations, once the hunting disturbance is removed, recovery from intense hunting is likely and may not result in detrimental long-term population effects. More recent findings comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the remaining hippo population currently faces genetic isolation and urges the need for specific protection and regional restoration programmes (Stoffel <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/> <br/> Lewison (2007) evaluates the relative impacts of the known threats to persistence—habitat loss (from agricultural or larger-scale development) and hunting pressure—on a model population. While accounting for rainfall variability and demographic stochasticity, the model results suggest that combinations of habitat loss and even moderate levels of adult mortality from hunting (1% of adults) can lead to relatively high probabilities of population declines over the next 30–40 years.</p>","Our current assessment suggests that across their range, there are on the order of 115,000-130,000 Common Hippos extant today. There are clear regional differences in population size and distribution across the range. Eastern and Southern African countries represent the conservation stronghold for this species and are the regions where the largest numbers of Common Hippos occur. Although Common Hippos are found in many West African nations, overall population sizes tend to be much smaller, either because of less available habitat or the higher density of human populations. Existing genetic research has suggested putative subpopulation designations among the regions (Okello <em>et al. </em>2005,&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Stoffel <em>et al. </em>2015) and future research on this is needed.<br/><br/><u><strong>Western Africa</strong></u><br/>The species is less widely distributed and typically occurs at low densities in West Africa. Common Hippos in West Africa are absent from the rain forests except near large rivers. They are most abundant in estuarine habitats and on the lower reaches of rivers. Current data suggests that Hippo populations in this region are at the highest level of risk due to the fragmented nature of their distribution and the high frequency of Hippo-human conflicts. Common Hippo population in this region is estimated to be approximately 7,500 spread over 19 countries. Within the region, Common Hippos are most abundant in Cameroon and Burkino Faso.<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Hippos are still present in Nzo Reserve, Mont Sangbe National Park, Haut Bandama and maybe Marahoue. Scattered small populations still remain in the lower parts of Sassandra, Bandama and Comoe Rivers (Roth <em>et al.</em> 2004). The largest populations in the country are found in Comoe National Park, with a total population over 100. Large numbers of Hippos were reportedly killed during recent civil unrest, up to 2012, with abundant hippo bones still evident. The estimate for Côte d’Ivoire puts the Hippo population at 500.<br/><br/>No formal country-level Hippo census has been conducted recently in Ghana. Hippos are thought to reside in Bui, Digya and Mole National Park, with Bui National Park as the most populated, supporting hundreds of Hippos at one point. Recent hydroelectric development in this area may have comprised this population.&#160; A well-monitored population of Hippos also reside in Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2010). The current Hippo population in Ghana is likely 150-200 individuals.<br/><br/>Extremely limited population information is available for Hippos in Togo. Keran National Park, Togodo Game Reserve and Nangbeto Lake are reported to have resident Hippo population but recent counts have not been reported. Rough estimates for Togo put the population at 200-500.<br/><br/>In Benin, the largest number of Hippos reside in the Mono River Basin, in small, isolated groups and larger aggregations, and in Pendjari National Park in the north, with an estimated 100 and 350 Hippos respectively&#160; (Amoussou<em> et al.</em> 2006). In Benin, Hippos are also likely to be found in the Oueme, Niger River and Sota Rivers. Annual census counts are conducted in Pendjari National Park and support a country-wide estimate of 500.<br/><br/>Burkina Faso has a number of large protected areas where Hippos reside, including “W” National Park which extends into Niger, and Benin,&#160; Arly and Deux Bales Forest reserves, Bala Biological Reserve (Dibloni <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012). Hippo have also been reported in Soula, Bagre, Tengrela and Sikorola Banzon Lakes, Comoé-Léraba, Sourou, and Bougouriba Rivers. Estimates for Hippos in Burkina Faso suggest 1,500-2,000 Hippos.<br/><br/>Although small in area, Guinea Bissau is thought to support a substantial Common Hippo population, particularly on the islands of the Bijagos Archipelago and along the numerous inland rivers. Local scientist estimate 100 Hippos based on behavioural research in the Orango complex, Bijagos Islands. Corubal River and Rio Cacheu National Park are also reported to have resident Hippo populations.&#160; The estimate of Hippos in Guinea Bissau is roughly between 200-500 individuals.<br/><br/>The species is also found on many of the rivers in Guinea. Haut Niger National Park has been estimated to have the largest Hippo population in Guinea (Brugiere <em>et al.</em> 2006) with around 100 individuals in the wet season. Badiar National Park and Niger River also have resident Hippos. Guinea may have a Hippo population on the order of 500 individuals.<br/><br/>Senegal has been reported to have a similar sized population (approximately 500 individuals) with the majority of Hippos found in Niokolo-Koba National Park, with widespread reports of hippo crop-raiding.<br/><br/>Low density and isolated Hippo populations are also found in the Gambia in Gambia River National Park, likely home to about 40 animals.<br/>In Mali, approximately 100 Hippos are reported to reside in Boucle du Baoule National Park.<br/><br/>Sierra Leone has an estimated 150 Hippo across several protected areas including Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Gola Rainforest National Park and Loma Mountains Forest Reserve. Hippos may also be present in Outamba-Killmi National Park and Kambui Hills South Forest Reserve.<br/><br/>Hippos are reported to reside in one national park in Equatorial Guinea in Monte Alen National Park. There are likely 50-100 Hippos there.<br/><br/>In Gabon, Hippos are reported to reside in Wonga-Wongue National Park, Sette-Cama and Moukalaba Forest Reserves. They have also been recently surveyed in the Gamba Complex (Reitmann 2012), a network of protected areas in south-western Gabon which includes Moukalaba-Doudou National Park and a series of lagoons, lakes and rivers. Based on this information, there are an estimated 250 Hippos in Gabon.<br/><br/>Another important regional stronghold for Common Hippos is Cameroon and recent census information has been collected in many parts of the country (Scholte and Iyah 2016). The larger populations of Hippos have been reported in Benoue, Kalamaloue, and Faro National Parks.&#160; Faro National Park has the largest numbers, with a 2016 census estimating nearly 1,000 individuals. Hippos have also been reported in Lakes Lagdo, Maga, Fianga, and Mbam et Djerem National Parks. The current estimates for Cameroon suggests a country-wide Hippo population of 1,500-2,000.<br/><br/>In Niger, 150-200 Hippos are reported to reside in W National Park , the Tapoa and Mekrou Rivers and along the Niger.<br/><br/>No recent census information is available for Nigeria, although Hippos have been reported in low numbers across a number of locations including Kainji Lake and Okumu National Parks, and Kwiambana, Sambisa and Yankari Game Reserves, and Hippos may still occur in the Niger Delta. An estimate 100 Hippos remain in Nigeria.<br/><br/>The majority of Hippos in Chad are reported to occur in Lake Chad and the Chari River including Mandelia and Manda National Parks. They are rarely found in Bahr Salamat, a river that crosses Zakouma National Park and&#160; Salamat Wildlife Game Reserve, but they inhabit Lake Iro in the latter. Hippos are no longer present in Lake Fitri. Restricted distirbutions of Hippos have been reported&#160; in Binder Leré Faunal Reserve (Brugiere and Scholte 2012). In some areas, Hippos are locally abundant and damage to crops and human casualties are increasing (Malachie Dolmia pers. comm.) . The current estimates for Chad suggests a country-wide Hippo population of 500.<br/><br/>Limited information is available on Hippos in Central African Republic (CAR), but Hippos are reported from a number of national parks and forest reserves at low densities. The best estimates are available for the Chinko protected area which is thought to be home to 200 Hippos. According to local experts, Hippos are still found around villages in eastern CAR where they hide in major rivers like Mbari but enter into rice fields where they are regarded as pest and crop raid. Hippos still&#160; likely reside in low numbers in Andre Felix, Bamimgui-Bangoran&#160; and Manovo-Gounda-Saint Floris National Parks and a number of forest reserves (Yata-Ngaya, Gribingui, Koukourou, Dzanga-Sangha). Country estimates put the population at 200-500 individuals.<br/><br/>No formal counts have been made in the Congo recently, but the species presence was confirmed in&#160; Odzala and Conkouati-Douili National Parks, and the Nyanga Nord, Lefini and Tsoulous&#160; Forest Reserves. Local experts put the Congo Hippo population at 50 individuals.<br/><br/><u><strong>Eastern Africa</strong></u><br/>Historically East Africa has been home to the largest populations of Common Hippos and despite some dramatic declines in particular countries in this region, populations number in the tens of thousands regionally, with an estimated total for Eastern Africa as a whole at about 50,000. Regionally, the largest populations of Common Hippos are found in Tanzania.<br/><br/>In Sudan, Hippos previously have been reported in Dinder National Park, however the current population size or status there is unknown.<br/><br/>In South Sudan, no recent Hippo censuses have been conducted, however, Hippos are reported in several areas. Most Hippo populations in the country are on the White Nile river except those in Southern National Parks (rivers Tonj and Sue) and Boma National Park and some other isolated small populations in North-western South Sudan.&#160; The largest aggregation of Common Hippos in South Sudan is reported to be in Nimule National Park,with an estimated population size of 2,000, but Hippos also occur in Badingilo National Park (including former Mongalla Game Reserve), in Zeraf and Shambe National Parks, Juba Game Reserve and Fanykang Game Reserves (Markéta Antonínová pers. comm). Common Hippos populations are reported to be declining and the regulation of hunting is limited due to military actions in this country. A rough estimate for South Sudan puts current Hippo populations at approximately 2,500.<br/><br/>Recent estimates from Ethiopia suggest that Hippos occur from the Djibouti border through the highlands&#160; to the south and south west, with the main threat reported to be habitat loss, degradation, and unregulated hunting. Earlier Hippo census efforts&#160; found the main strongholds to be the Omo, Awash and Great Abbi (Blue Nile), Gibe Rivers. Hippos are also found in many of the larger lakes (Lake Abaya, Lake Hawassa, Lake Langano, Lake Ziway, Lake Chamo) and isolated populations in smaller swamps and pools. The northern limit of the species is the Setit River. One of largest hippo populations are found in Dhati-Welel National Park, a newly gazetted area in May 2012. Very few animals remain in neighbouring Somalia (<em>ca</em>. 50) although some small groups have been reported on the lower Shebeli River and along the Juba River. No common hippos have been reported from Djibouti. Current estimates for Ethiopia are 2,500.<br/><br/>Although hippos were found in Eritrea in the mid 1960s and 70s, it is likely they are no longer present in the country.<br/><br/>The species occurs in a number of reserves and parks throughout Kenya. The most recent census information is available for the Masai Mara National Reserve (4,200, Kanga <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other locations where Hippos have been reported, but not recently confirmed, in Kenya include Amboseli , Lake Nakuru, Meru, Nairobi, and Tsavo National Parks and several National Reserves&#160; - Buffalo Springs, Kora, Lake Bogoria, Mwea, North Kitui and Samburu. Hippos are also found in Lake Victoria. Although recent censuses are not available, best estimates for Kenya put the Hippo population at 6,500 for the country.<br/><br/>In Tanzania, the most recent census information are from 2001 (TAWIRI 2001). In September 2001 (dry season), a total of approximately 20,000 Hippos were counted with the largest concentrations of Hippos observed in Kilombero, Rufiji and Great Ruaha Rivers. Although this direct census likely presented an underestimate because of uncounted or undetected animals, we use this value because the census effort is not current. The census effort found that a large proportion of Hippos (80%) counted were found inside protected areas, highlighting the importance of the the protected area networks to Hippos in Tanzania. Most Hippos were found in southern Tanzania and especially in the Selous Game Reserve and its immediate vicinity. Other important localities for Hippos were the Katavi-Rukwa protected area complex. The Ugalla and Malagarassi Rivers and the Serengeti and Mara Rivers.<br/>Lack of Hippo population information in Uganda is surprising given the historical prevalence of Hippo populations and Hippo research in this country. The principal concentrations of the species in Uganda in the past were in two large national parks, Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth. At one time the population in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) reached 21,000, but this was reduced to about 14,000 in a culling programme of the 1950s. Counts in the early 1970s returned about 11,000 but heavy poaching during the Amin years had left only a couple of thousand by 1989 when 2,172 were estimated from an aerial sample count. Since then, Hippo populations&#160; have recovered. Current estimate for QENP are from 5,000 to 6,000 Hippos (Andrew Plumpter pers. comm). In addition, Hippos inhabit several other national parks and wildlife reserves as Kibale National Park, Katonga and Kabwoya, East Madi Wildlife Reserves, and Lake Mburo National Park as well as Semliki River and Lakes Victoria and Kyoga. Most Hippo populations in Uganda are reported as stable or slightly increasing. The overall estimate for the country is 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/>Common Hippos have a wide distribution in DR Congo including some in the north-west of the country although the bulk is in the east, where they occur around Epulu and Wamba and along some of the larger rivers in the Ituri Forest. Other populations occur on the Zaire River (Yangabi), Bomu River, Rusizi River and elsewhere in several national parks including Garamba, Kundelungu, Salonga, Upemba and Virunga as well as Luama Hunting Reserve. At one point in the mid 1980s, there was an estimated 26,000 Hippos across the country. However, these numbers declined dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s as a function of widespread civil unrest and associated rampant unregulated hunting. The most dramatic declines were observed in the Virunga National Park. Since 2002, Hippo population have increased slightly in most protected areas as reported for Garamba National Park where 2,600 Hippos in main rivers – Aka, Dungu, Garamba - and the neighbouring hunting areas were counted (Schapira and Antonínová 2011). Estimates from a 2014 UNESCO mission in Virunga area reported 1,500 hippos with current estimates&#160; at 2,000 individuals (Deo Kujirakwinja pers. comm). This suggests current country-wide estimates for DR Congo are likely approximately 5,000.<br/><br/>Census information is available for Rwanda as an aerial survey in Rwanda, conducted in 2013, found some 800-1,000 Hippos in Akagera National Park (MacPherson 2013), which has historically been an area where hippos have been abundant. Their distribution is widespread along the wetland fringes with focal points in Lakes Rwanyakizinga and Hago.<br/><br/>Common Hippos in Burundi have been reported on the Malagarazi, Ruvubu and Rusizi Rivers but there are conflicting reports over numbers. The largest populations appear to be in Rusizi Reserve, with an estimated population of 500 Hippos. Both earlier and current reports suggest that unregulated hunting is widespread. The estimated Hippo populations in Rwanda is 1,000 Hippos and 750 in Burundi.<br/>&#160;<br/><u><strong>Southern Africa</strong></u><br/>Southern Africa is also home to large populations of Common Hippos. This region has also experienced Hippo population declines related to civil unrest and war. The coarse estimate for the region is 60,000. Regionally, the largest populations of Common Hippos are found in Zambia.<br/><br/>Zambia has historically been a stronghold for Common Hippo populations and recent country-wide estimates suggests Zambia continues to serve as a stronghold for the species. The population is widely distributed, with the key Hippo areas in order of importance based on population size as Luangwa River (25,000), Zambezi River (6,500), Kafue River (4,000) and the Lufupa River tributary of Kafue River (1,600). The Luangwa, Zambezi and Kafue Rivers hold 87 % of the Hippo population in Zambia. As with Hippo populations in other countries, the Hippo populations in Zambia fluctuates in response&#160; to changing rainfall conditions and available forage (Chomba 2013). The densities of Hippos range across these areas with densities highest in the Luangwa River reaching as high as 42 Hippos/per km of river stretch in some areas. Generally the national population is stable, although there is concern of Hippo viability particularly outside protected areas where human settlements and fishing activities have increased leading to increased human-Hippo conflicts from crop raiding or Hippo attacks.<br/><br/>Malawi also has areas densely populated with Hippos with most populations confined to national parks and other protected area. The largest and potentially increasing population of more than 2,000 individuals inhabits Liwonde National Park. More than 300 Hippos were reported in Vwaza Marshes National Park, with smaller populations in Majete and Kasungu National Parks of no more than 100 individuals. All these popualtions are stable or increasing. Hippos disapeared from Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve, although the suitable habitat remains there (Samuel Kamoto, Craig Raid, Craig Hay, Patricio Ndadzela pers. comm.). Dozens of individuals persist in Lake Malawi and the shire rivers (Johnathan Vaughan pers. comm.), areas where Hippos had been previously abundant. Whereas the conservation&#160; in protected areas is good, in other areas, hippos are illegally hunted for bushmeat and teeth. The total population estimate for Malawi is 3,000.<br/><br/>In Zimbabwe, Common Hippos are found in areas that border the Zambesi river in the north and the Limpopo river in the south. Hippos are also found on privately owned game farms, conservancies, recreational lands and other unprotected areas throughout the country.&#160; As a result of intensive agricultural development, Zimbabwe has more than 50,000 small to medium-sized dams which could provide habitat for hippos. The most recent population information on Common Hippos in Zimbabwe is from 2007-2010 (Zisadra <em>et al.</em> 2010) and suggests that Zimbabwe’s Hippo population is stable at approximately 5,000 individuals.<br/><br/>In 1986, Mozambique was thought to have an estimated population of approximately 20,000 Common Hippos. However more recent surveys have found this estimated population to be a gross overestimation (Mackie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Populations of Common Hippos were surveyed in 2010 during a national crocodile survey (and corrected to account for under-counting). Unregulated hunting and poaching of Hippo has drastically reduced Common Hippo numbers and the trend continues (Anderson and Pariela 2005). In 2013, the CITES Standing Committee suspended all Hippo trade or export from Mozambique due to the lack of information on the abundance, distribution and hunting permits of Hippos in the country. There are now estimated to be approximately 3,000 Hippos in Mozambique with the majority of the Hippos found in Lake Cabora Bassa and the Zambesi river. Other areas with sizeable Hippo populations included the Niassa National Reserve, Maputo River and Reserve, and Save, Pungwe and Ruvuma Rivers.<br/><br/>In the 1960s, Hippos were reported as widespread in Angola. There is limited information on current distribution and population sizes. Hippos have been reported to occur in Cunene, Cubango, Cuando, Cuanza, Cuvo, Longa and Zambesi rivers, in Bicuar, Cameia, Mupa, and Quiçama National Parks and in Luando Game Reserve. The population numbers in Quiçama NP and Luando GR are estimated as less than 30 and 100 individuals, respectively. The main threat to Hippos in Angola is poaching and human develepoment along the rivers (Pedro Vaz Pinto pers. comm.).&#160; Although no census information is available, based on this information, an estimated 500 Hippos likely remain in Angola.<br/><br/>Hippo abundance and distribution in Namibia is based on recent censuses by the Wildlife Research and Monitoring, Ministry of Environment &amp; Tourism, and puts the population at approximately 3,300. Namibia supports Common Hippos largely&#160; in two areas: Okavango, including Bwabwata National Park, and Kwando, where the majority of Hippos are found, including Bwabwata National Park, Mudumu National Park and Nkasa Rupara National Park.&#160; Some Common Hippos can also be found in the Linyanti, Chobe and Zambesi Rivers.<br/><br/>Hippos in Botswana are centred in the Okavango Delta and also in the Chobe, Linyati River systems. Outside this area, a small population may still exist near Ghanzi although some observers think this is unlikely. The most recent estimated total for northern Botswana where Hippos reside is 1,600 in the wet season and 500 in the dry.<br/><br/>South Africa has country-wide information on Common Hippos&#160; as a national assessment for the species has recently been completed (National Red List Assessment in review). There are two major subpopulations in South Africa, occurring in the lowveld of north-eastern South Africa and that of northern Kwa-Zulu Natal. Most other populations across the country are fragmented by fences or other barriers that limit movement. Water quality and quantity has declined, which has possibly led to fragmentation too. Kruger National Park is believed to be home&#160; to 3,000 individuals, which represents an increase for the park. The current Hippo population in Mpumalanga is estimated at 1,000 animals, where 575 animals occur in provincial and private nature reserves, with an estimated 430 Hippos in the neighbouring river systems. Most of the hippo subpopulation in the protected areas and rivers close to the KNP show strong positive growth trends, in spite of significant Hippo removals through damage-causing animal complaints and pro-active Hippo capture operations In Limpopo, there is an estimated 700 animals, with another 700 residing in the Olifants and Letaba Rivers. Hippo in KwaZulu-Natal are mainly confined to the large rivers, coastal lakes and estuaries of north eastern Zululand and Maputaland regions of the province.&#160; Recent population estimates for the province of KZN suggests approximately 2,000 animals in 10 formally protected areas and on 22 private and communal protected areas. Currently the largest single populations are found in the St Lucia Game Reserve component of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park (1,000 individuals) and Ndumo Game Reserve (200 individuals). In the North-West Province, there are approximately 100 individuals on formally protected areas and on private lands. In Swaziland, the population is currently estimated at about 120 animals. These estimates suggest that there are 7,000 Common Hippos in South Africa.",Stable,"Common Hippopotamus (referred to as Common Hippos or Hippos hereafter) are found in many countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa in suitable wetland habitats. The species still occupies much of its former range from 1959, although population sizes have declined.

The decline  is expected to continue due to a continuing rise in hunting that stems  from increased demand of taxidermy ornaments worldwide. Some local  populations may be also threatened by the increasing habitat alteration,  vehicular traffic and disturbance to the roosts.","The species has been recorded in dry deciduous forests, dry dipterocarp  forest, small woodland patches, floodplain and various agriculture lands  such as paddy field, sugarcane field, orchard and mixed plantation  (Sharma 1986, Kruskop 2013, Madhavan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  2015, Hawkeswood and Sommung 2017). It is found roosting mainly in dried  leaves of banana, dry grass and sugar cane, but occasionally in green  leaves of banana and broadleaf trees, flower, half-built nest of Baya  weaver bird on mesquite tree, and paper shelter for wrapping guava fruit  (Sharma 1986, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hawkeswood and Sommung 2017, Patel <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Thailand, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  (2015) reported the roost sites are generally near irrigation water.  This species mostly roosts at a height between 1-1.5 m from the ground.  It frequently switches roost sites at short distances (&lt;800 m) every  to four days. It forms small family of three bats (one adult male, one  adult female, and one young) from February to September, but remain  singly and in pair in November and December. Paired animals primarily  have high fidelity of partnership through years with shared home range  but have no overlap with other individual, expect their young in a year.  Individual home range is generally small, 6.1 ha for males and 5.6 ha  for females in average, at short distance from day roosts (c. 350 m  averagely). The bat mainly feeds on small web spiders (Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  2015) most likely associated with its behaviour of fluttering flight  near ground vegetation (Smith and Xie 2013) and short high frequency  echolocation calls (Sripathy <em>et al.</em> 2006).

Specimens on sale have been observed in  souvenir shops in Ho Chi Minh city in Viet Nam and Weimar city in  Germany. It is also sold online worldwide, at least in Australia, China,  France, Japan, Netherlands, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United  States. Roost disturbance is another threat to this species most likely  due to its notable colouration and use of commercial crop plants in  cultivation lands. Witness of the bats in farming areas by local people have occasionally been reported from Sri Lanka and Thailand. In Sri  Lanka, a roadkill incidence (Karunarathna <em>et al.</em> 2017) and a cat  kill (Tharaka Kusuminda, pers. com.) of this species have been reported.  In South Asia, this species is potentially threatened by habitat loss,  through commercial logging, conversion of plantation lands to make way  for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002).

The human population on Bougainville and Buka is estimated at 200,000 people, and could potentially lead to an increase in opportunistic hunting. In Solomon Islands the level hunting pressure varies regionally. On Western Province islands where Seventh Day Adventism is the predominant religion, Solomons Flying Fox is rarely hunted. In other locations in it appears to be hunted regularly, but the absence of firearms precludes large numbers being taken (T. Lavery pers. comm.).

In Solomon Islands large colonies occur at Viru Harbour, New Georgia, Kukudu School, Kolombangara, Lake Rano, Rendova, and Kolobangara River, Choiseul (T. Lavery pers. comm). Bowen-Jones <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (1997) investigated six reported colonies of this species on Choiseul Island in 1995 and found that four of these had been abandoned. The two remaining colonies contained estimates of 7,188 and 5,200 individuals. Assuming an average colony size of 5,000 individuals the authors estimated the population of <em>P. rayneri </em>comprised by these colonies had declined from 35,000 to 12,300 individuals between 1985 and 1995.",Decreasing,"This species occurs on the islands of Bougainville and Buka of Papua New Guinea, and is found on the Solomon Islands of Choiseul and Arnavon (S.

Its known extent of occurrence (EOO; Vanikoro Island) is 252 km², and it likely occupies a smaller range within this area (area of occupancy is therefore below the 500 km² threshold for EN B2). The species has yet to be confirmed as occurring on Utupua Island. There is a continuing projected decline in extent and quality of habitat caused by logging operations across Vanikoro, which were renewed in 2013/2014. The global population is known from 1-2 small island locations and at risk of a single catastrophic event (such as a cyclone).","Recent transect surveys have recorded the species foraging in primary  and secondary rainforest, mangroves, subsistence gardens and coconut  plantations, but not recently logged forest (T. Leary, T. Lavery, M.  Tahi, C. Shaw and R. Pierce pers. obs). <em>Pteropus tuberculatus</em> is a  solitary roosting species, occasionally found in pairs. It has been  recorded roosting in the lower–mid branches of sub-canopy trees in  primary forests and agroforests (T. Leary, T. Lavery, M. Tahi, C. Shaw  and R. Pierce pers. obs).<br/><br/>Vanikoro Flying Fox often forages  during the day, peaking in the two hours prior to sunset before <em>P.  tonganus </em>become active (T. Leary, T. Lavery, M. Tahi, C. Shaw and R.  Pierce pers. obs). The species has been documented feeding on flowers,  nectar and fruit from a diverse range of food plants (T. Leary, T.  Lavery, M. Tahi, C. Shaw and R. Pierce pers. obs). The relative  importance of different species of plant in the diet of the Vanikoro  Flying Fox is unknown.<br/><br/>Nothing is known of the species longevity or  reproduction although Sanborn (1931) records collection of a single  juvenile with three adults in August 1926. Other <em>Pteropus </em>species bear a  single young, and have a lifespan that is approximately 8 or 9 years.","Vanikoro was extensively logged between 1926 and 1964 by the Vanikoro  Kauri Timber Company (Bennett 2000). According to Bennett (2000)  extraction was haphazard and concentrated on the most easily accessible  timber which left pockets of natural forest and has presumably allowed  the Vanikoro Flying Fox to persist. Logging recommenced around  2013/2014, and according to local informants the agreement covers  three-quarters of the larger Vanikoro Island of Baine (T. Leary pers.  comm). More recently the logging company has proposed to log the  smaller Vanikoro island of Tevai, despite customary landowners’  objections (Kekea 2018). The impacts of logging on foraging and roosting  habitat of <em>Pteropus tuberculatus</em> is unknown, but recent limited transect  surveys failed to record the species in recently logged forest (T.  Leary, T. Lavery, M. Tahi, C. Shaw pers. obs).<br/><br/>The threat posed by  hunting and persecution is unknown, although anecdotal evidence suggests  it is not a preferred food (T. Leary, T. Lavery, M. Tahi, and C. Shaw  pers. comm). However, the species is persecuted to protect  fruit/coconuts and may be killed by younger men as practice for hunting  the larger<em> Pteropus tonganus</em>, but whether this contributes significant  mortality is unknown (R. Pierce pers. comm). Cyclones which are  frequent events in the Solomon Islands potentially pose a threat to the  species given the narrow radius of the two Vanikoro islands (less than  24 km wide) and the proximity (less than 43 km northwest) of Utupua (if  the species occurs on this island). Severe cyclones are known to  devastate forests in 30–100 km strips along the cyclone track. Garden  expansion (subsistence agriculture) may potentially limit the  availability of roosting sites with dense foliage, although the species  is regularly recorded foraging in subsistence gardens with fruiting  trees. The extent of this threat is likely to be limited given the small  human population on the islands.","The global population is suspected to be declining, although there are  very limited data available on population size or trend. However,  Troughton (1927) describes the species as ‘plentiful at Vanikoro’ in  1926. Recent limited surveys (2014–2018) have confirmed the Vanikoro  Flying Fox to be relatively uncommon in lowland coastal areas (T.  Lavery, M. Tahi, C. Shaw and R. Pierce pers. obs.) and absent from  recently logged areas (T. Leary, T. Lavery, M. Tahi and C. Shaw pers.  obs). Prior to these recent surveys the species was only known from  around 13 specimens collected in 1828 and 1926.",Decreasing,"Recent surveys (2014–2018) have confirmed the existence of the species  on Baine (184 km²) and Tevai (20 km²) islands collectively known as  Vanikoro Island in the southern Solomon Islands (T. Leary, T. Lavery, M.  Tahi, C. Shaw and R. Pierce pers. obs). Although not documented during  recent surveys, the species may also exist in low numbers on nearby  Utupua Island (60 km²) (J. Gamou pers. comm). The altitudinal range of  the species is poorly known, but it has not been recorded above 200 m  during recent limited survey above this altitude. Around 35% of the area  of these islands are above 200 m. Regardless of whether the species  occurs above 200 m, it is the most restricted range <em>Pteropus </em>in the  Solomon Islands (Leary and Aujare 1994).","Local informants on Vanikoro indicated <em>Pteropus tuberculatus</em> is not hunted for  food as it is distasteful and/or too small for eating and that the  preferred flying-fox for food was the much larger <em>Pteropus</em> <em>tonganus </em>(T.  Leary, T. Lavery, M. Tahi, C. Shaw and R. Pierce pers. comm). The true  level of mortality from hunting and persecution is unknown, but the  species is at times killed to prevent damage to coconuts and other  garden fruits, and younger men hunt them purely as a distraction. The  teeth of this species, along with those of <em>P. tonganus</em>, are very  occasionally traded with people from other islands for use in Kastom  necklaces (T. Leary pers. comm).",Terrestrial,"It is listed on Appendix II of CITES, but it is extremely doubtful that  the species is currently traded internationally (T. Leary pers. comm).

Additional surveys are needed in a wider range of habitat types and elevations, particularly  above 200 m elevation and away from the coastal strip where cultivated  food trees are abundant and may, at least seasonally support higher  densities of the species. Further research is needed on distribution and  habitat use by the species to determine the suitability of logged forests since much  of its distribution is now likely to be logged, this should include  monitoring of population trends. Further research on the level and  impact of hunting and persecution is needed.

22153828,44703,Muntiacus vuquangensis,Critically Endangered,A3cd+4cd,2016,2015-11-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Hunting pressure is extremely high throughout most of the Large-antlered Muntjac’s small global range, resulting in population densities of almost all mammals of comparable size greatly below pre-exploitation levels and, within the region, declines probably exceed 30% over the last 15–25 years even for the most resilient species such as Northern Red Muntjac (see that species' 2015 Red List account). Based, particularly on camera-trapping results, Large-antlered Muntjac in most of its presumed range has a local population status more similar to the likes of Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>), Saola (<em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>)<em> </em>and Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>), all species that are unquestionably Critically Endangered (declines of 90% or more in the last 20–30 years) within the range of Large-antlered Muntjac, than to species such as Northern Red Muntjac, even though the latter is congeneric.<br/><br/>Although the paucity of solid survey data hinders the use of range reduction in red listing this species, such contraction is likely to be a contributory factor particularly over the next three generations when ongoing hunting and habitat trends will exterminate many of the small and isolated populations presumed still persisting. In 2015, although there are still essentially no hard data, such extirpations have almost certainly started to occur (e.g., in Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area (NPA), Lao PDR). The extreme paucity of recent (post-2000) records from most of this muntjac’s known range indicate that the species is now at very low densities, with a presumably numerically small but incalculable population in the majority of its former range. Surveys since 2008 bring even greater support to this statement, as well as more strongly suggesting that these low densities are hunting induced. The species may never have been as abundant in its range as Northern Red Muntjac overall, even though locally they are sometimes similar in abundance. But such a difference cannot be assumed, it may simply be that by the time of its scientific discovery, Large-antlered Muntjac was already greatly reduced across most its range, in the same way that sympatric Tiger, wild cattle, Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>)<em> </em>and even Sambar (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>)<em> </em>were by the early 1990s in Lao PDR and Viet Nam. However, assuming that pre-exploitation densities were in general somewhat lower than those of Northern Red Muntjac, the very low densities indicated for the 2008 assessment at least a 50% reduction in about 21 years (generation length is seven years for this species) in all of past, present and future. In 2015, these rates of decline now seem overly very optimistic, especially in light of the current situation in Nakai - Nam Theun NPA, see below). In 2008 data did not exist to allow empirical determination of actual decline rate, but its magnitude was based on: such a level of reduction in population would be barely detectable by survey styles to date, the species’ rarity seems both unnatural and recent, reflecting the massive scale of trade-driven snaring and the ubiquity of ‘subsistence’-level snaring, the ubiquity of non-targeted hunting methods which will wipe out even relict populations of individual species provided at least one other desirable species caught by the same means remain in numbers sufficient for hunting to be viable, the apparent association of the species with lower and mid altitude forests, probably particularly with broken canopy, and thus the overlap of populations with the highest hunting levels for wild meat, and the lack of secure source populations in large rugged forest-clothed massifs, the presence of a large hydropower project (Nam Theun 2, in central Lao PDR) within the healthiest known population, which flooded some prime habitat and, unintentionally, greatly facilitated trade-driven hunting throughout that population, and the inability of the last 15 years of stepped-up conservation activities in the region to make any serious inroads on hunting and trading of ungulates. Information since 2008 suggests that the decline rate was probably both higher than estimated and has if anything increased, despite positive developments in limited situations, in general the intensity of threats has greatly increased since 2008, yet the conservation response overall has failed to follow to a concomitant level. In particular the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project has probably had much greater negative impact than even the most realistic pre-impoundment scenarios predicted. In addition, the opening of access in the heart of the species’ range through recent construction of the Ho Chi Minh Highway through the Annamite Mountains in Viet Nam (with feeder roads into Lao PDR) has greatly increased hunting pressure.<br/><br/>In particular, the up-listing to Critically Endangered reflects further data from Viet Nam, suggesting that the species survives nowhere commonly, and in all well-surveyed areas is now extremely rare or extirpated. In contrast, the regularity with which trophy frontlets were found in the 1990s indicated that it was then still widespread. Furthermore, hunting pressure and forest clearance in southern Viet Nam, where there was a hope in 2008 that significant populations might persist, has increased substantially since the beginning of the century. Recent data from Lao PDR also suggests a bleaker picture than was hoped, with only one new area found where the species could be considered reasonably common, whilst in several other areas there has been confirmation of the species's rarity. Current trends on the Nakai Plateau and in other areas of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA suggest very significant declines are already underway. In the only other area where there is an indication of a significant population, Laving Laveun Provincial Protected Area, current factors suggest it is only a matter of time before seemingly inevitable declines begin. Whilst the Nakai-Nam Theun population and presumed similar populations in other remote sites tempered the 2008 listing by constituting large populations with presumed only moderate decline, and with a hope that law enforcement activities might significantly reduce hunting intensity, this can no longer be assumed. The global population has in the past 15-25 years has almost certainly exceeded a decline rate of over 90% and will surely do so in the future if current trends continue.<br/>&#160;<br/>The recommendations in 2008 that “it is vital that the surveys proposed in southern Viet Nam are undertaken and that the Nakai Plateau and Nakai–Nam Theun population be monitored closely in coming years, and that, based on these sources of information, the red list categorisation be reviewed regularly” (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2008a) still hold true in 2016, it is unfortunate however that so little has been achieved in the intervening years.","The habitat preferences of the Large-antlered Muntjac remain unclear. Its global distribution is somewhat similar to better-understood species such as Crested Argus <em>Rheinardia ocellata</em> and Red-shanked Douc <em>Pygathrix nemaeus</em>, suggesting that it is tied to the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests characteristic of the Annamites, and cannot use the climatically drier hill semi-evergreen forests further north and west. But paradoxically, it is not now common in the ‘ever-wet’ eastern slopes of the Northern and Central Annamite ranges. Perhaps, as is strongly suspected with both Crested Argus and Red-shanked Douc, substantial population losses have resulted from very high hunting pressure in such regions. While such a proposition is consistent with the apparent decline at Vu Quang Nature Reserve during the 1990s as discussed in Eve <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2001: 45 and 122, see above, under Population), there is no real evidence for it, although information from villagers in Viet Nam does suggest such a pattern (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). An intrinsic sub-optimality of closed-canopy ever-wet forest cannot yet be ruled out. Both the areas for which there is reasonable evidence for relatively high abundance, the Nakai Plateau and adjacent areas of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, and the Lam Dong Province, are both a rather heterogeneous mosaic of habitats, with extensive areas not supporting closed-canopy forest (based on historical rather than recent disturbance). Although there are a significant number of records from the Nakai Plateau in essentially mosaic habitat, many of the camera-trapped individuals in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA were within large closed canopy Semi-evergreen Forest blocks (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of WMPA camera-trapping unpublished data). Although much of the Annamites in Lao PDR and Viet Nam could also be described as “a rather heterogeneous mosaic of habitats”, there are not many such extensive landscapes without high densities of human population and heavy fragmentation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Habitat in Vu Quang NR is more contiguous and primarily evergreen forest, climatically wetter than the above two areas, but at lower altitudes much of the forest is somewhat opened-up (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The areas of Laving Laveun PPA where the species was camera-trapped was essentially unbroken closed canopy forest, best considered Semi-evergreen forest at the mesic end of its spectrum, somewhat transitional with Wet Evergreen Forest, within relatively steep terrain (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Timmins 2013b). Muntjac remains in villages and camera-trapping in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam suggest a lack of syntopy between the Large-antlered Muntjac and the Roosevelts' group, even though there is a wide sympatry (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, B. Long pers. comm. 2008, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The Large-antlered Muntjac’s altitudinal range remains somewhat uncertain: hunting areas around most villages from which specimens come span a wide range. Interviews of villagers throughout Quang Nam, Hue and Quang Tri provinces, Viet Nam, all suggested that this muntjac does not live much above 900 m asl (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), however the ability of villagers to identify muntjacs to species appears to be variable but in general poor (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Dersu 2008, Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press b). Altitudinal and other location specific information derived from remains of animals seen in villages needs evidence of its reliability: specifically, hunters’ statements of origins of skulls, no matter how certain-sounding, need to be taken carefully, often, hunters assertively associate skulls and lower jaws as from one animal when tooth-wear patterns show that they must have come from different individuals (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and attempts at corroborating the details of specific hunting incidents of Saola (a rare species) by carrying out repeat interviews has often shown conflicting statements and changes in ‘facts’ between the interviews (Timmins 2013b, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010: pp. 72-74, Timmins in press b).<br/><br/>The majority of camera-trapped individuals in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA have been below 1000 m with the highest-altitude detection thought to be around 1200 m, despite camera-trapping to much higher elevations (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b, WMPA unpublished data). Records from Laving Laveun PPA came from 550-800 m (21 of 23 cameras being set between 500-800 m, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). The records from Khe Nuoc Trong PNR came from below 200 m (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2015). In the southern Annamites the single record from Chu Yang Sin NP came from 900 m (BirdLife International 2010). The Dak Nong – Mondulkiri Plateau largely lies below 1000 m (Timmins in press a). Lam Ha District, Lam Dong lies predominantly between 900-1200 m with higher elevations in other districts of Lam Dong Province. The elevations of the camera-trap records from Bolikhamxay Province in the 1990s are not precisely known, but were likely to have been below 1000 m (based on reported locations and the terrain visible in the pictures, Robichaud and Stuart 1999, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Camera-trapping at elevations above 1500 m at sites where mammal populations appear not to have been severely impacted by hunting includes both Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and Xe Sap NPA, suggesting that the lack of records from such elevations are a genuine reflection of ecological habitat preferences (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b, WMPA unpublished data, WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). The lower elevation limits of the species are much more poorly understood, particularly as recent presence (or lack thereof) at lower elevations is probably strongly affected by hunting, in Nakai-Nam Theun the species was evidently common down to c. 500 m, the lowest elevation that extensive camera-trapping was undertaken (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b, Dersu 2008, WMPA unpublished data). Relatively few areas below 500 m in Lao PDR and almost none surveyed by camera-trapping are likely to be ecologically suitable, as the gradient in climate moving west away from the Annamite spine is in most areas likely to be far steeper than the equivalent gradient in elevation away from the Annamite spine. In Viet Nam there are so few records with known point localities that the lower altitudinal limits of the species are hard to even speculate, which in combination with the facts that almost all Annamite forest areas below c. 500 m probably experience(d) very intensive hunting pressure and there are very few areas left below this altitude large enough to hold viable populations makes it unlikely that the lower elevation limits will be determined. Many Annamite species show significant differences in lower altitudinal ‘limits’ between the eastern and western slopes (often much lower in the east), and the same could well be true for Large-antlered Muntjac (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2016). Taken together the data available suggest that the species mostly occurred below about 1,000 m asl (as previously speculated e.g. Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Evans <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000), but localised higher occurrence in undulating plateaux, for example in the Southern Annamites of Cambodia and Viet Nam, would not be surprising (e.g. Bauer 1997). <br/><br/>The lack of precisely located field records also hinders assessment of use of secondary habitats. As an ungulate dependent upon ground-level food (including fallen fruit, presumably, when available), densities would be expected to be higher in edge, broken and secondary areas than in closed-canopy tall evergreen forest.","Threats as identified by the 2008 assessment by and large still remain true in 2015. The 2008 assessment of threats is reiterated below along with updates and qualifications based on new information since that time.<br/><br/>As of 2008, suitable habitat for the Large-antlered Muntjac is still extensive (under the reasonable assumption that it uses secondary forest), but, especially within Viet Nam, it seems absent from many accessible, but superficially, at least, suitable habitat blocks. In the intervening period there has been an acceleration in the rate of habitat loss at low to mid elevations, especially in the Southern Annamites, as clearly indicated by comparison of satellite images from different periods over the last few decades. This strongly indicates that over-hunting is its primary threat. Heavy deployment of camera-traps in several interior forests of Viet Nam produced few photographs, showing that Large-antlered Muntjac can be rare even in the most remote areas. A decline would suggest great susceptibility to hunting, but it is possible that it was never common in the types of interior closed-canopy forest surveyed and is restricted to specific types (not yet camera-trapped) or may even be strongly associated with edges. If the latter, then a high proportion of the population would be facing very heavy hunting pressure as well as an accelerating threat of habitat loss due to clear-felling for plantation forestry, because of proximity to settlement of much of the suitable habitat. Whatever the explanation for the rarity of records in most camera-trapping areas, it suggests a much stronger level of threat than has hitherto been appreciated (e.g. by Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, the listing as only Provisionally At Risk in Lao PDR in the latter is now clearly inappropriately optimistic). While the socio-economic factors outlined in this section bear on the conservation status of all ungulates and primates, of most carnivores, and of many other mammals in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Large-antlered Muntjac is probably one of two species (the other being Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>) which is most at global risk through them. This is because it is big enough to be a main wildlife meat source, it does not have populations secured in other countries such as India, Nepal and Thailand, with installed effective management in at least some protected areas, it does not have populations in the rugged mountain forest blocks where trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is limited by economics of accessibility, and it does not occur on the plains where (for a mix of essentially non-biological reasons) protected area management is being most successful in conserving ungulates (e.g. Cambodia).<br/><br/>Large-antlered Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture which abounds in all range states and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and <em>Aquilaria </em>resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Hunters do not target Large-antlered Muntjacs, but are seeking any and all species with marketable meat and products for the medicinal markets. Such hunting reaches all this muntjac’s range, and with so many species and products, non-selective methods continue at high levels until the most resilient species is no longer common enough for hunting to be commercially viable. This non-specificity makes regional hunting practices a peculiarly strong driver of localised and, in aggregate, regional, extinctions (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted or there becomes a serious commitment on the behalf of range-state governments to address the issue. Large-antlered Muntjacs will be extinct long before these more resilient species become so rare that communities are driven to ‘fishing down’ for smaller species using methods that do not threaten Large-antlered Muntjacs. In 2015, the human population of Viet Nam exceeds 93 million, that of China 1 billion. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels.<br/><br/>Hunting in Large-antlered Muntjacs's range is therefore very high: in the Northern and Central Annamites of Viet Nam, in a range shared with Saola, an estimated eight million people, almost all with the propensity to eat wildlife and mostly with direct links to the urban wildlife trade, live within 100 km of forest inhabited by Saola, and probably nowhere in the range of Large-antlered Muntjac is further than 30 km from a village (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Vietnamese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Vietnamese border probably has snares capable of capturing Large-antlered Muntjac set in it every year (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Very localised law enforcement efforts especially in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves since 2011/2012, has probably to some extent mitigated this, and some small pockets of high-elevation terrain and the remotest of areas (e.g. limestone terrain) probably escape such high pressure, but countering this, snaring intensity in Lao areas in particular has certainly increased. Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km² per year (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but the intensity and spatial scale of snaring is increasing dramatically (Timmins 2013a, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Timmins in press a, b, Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014 a, b). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and the northern and central Annamites of Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing. In 2014 this appears now to be almost certainly the case over large areas of the Southern Annamites, even though sites such as Cat Tien NP retain anomalously healthy large mammal populations in a Vietnamese context, in many areas in fact hunting intensity of ground dwelling mammals may be approaching the levels of the Northern and Central Annamites (Timmins in press a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), furthermore habitat loss in the Southern Annamites appears to be accelerating with substantial loss of mid-elevation forest already having occurred for instance on the Dak Nong – Mondulkiri Plateau (Timmins in press a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of satellite images).<br/><br/>Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in most of Large-antlered Muntjac’s range have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), the paucity of records across its range shows that this includes Large-antlered Muntjac itself. Field survey encounter rates even with Northern Red Muntjacs and pigs in much of Large-antlered Muntjac's range are remarkably low compared with other areas in Asia (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), wild cattle, Asian Elephant, and Tiger are all nearing extinction in this muntjac’s range (e.g. Duckworth and Hedges 1998), and in some of the worst-hit protected areas even the generally robust Northern Red Muntjac and wild pig are ecologically extinct (e.g. the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan NPA, Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on 2007 field visit). Further surveys since 2008 have only reinforced this picture of dwindling wildlife populations and probable local extirpation of the most vulnerable species in ever more fragmented landscapes (Timmins in press a, b, Timmins 2013a, Suford 2010, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Timmins 2009. In the Nakai Plateau and Nakai-Nam Theun NPA, in some sectors the Large-antlered Muntjac and Northern Red Muntjac are similar in abundance. Comparison with other areas, where the former is much scarcer than the latter, implies that the Large-antlered is much more sensitive to hunting than is the Northern Red Similar results from Laving Laveun PPA further reinforce the probability that hunting above all else is the primary factor behind scarcity of the species in most Annamite forests at mid elevations (R.J Timmins pers. comm 2015). It may be intentionally targeted more (although there is no evidence for this, and it seems unlikely), or some facet of population biology such as fecundity (possible given its slightly larger size) may make it less resilient, or it may be associated with habitats that (for other reasons) are targeted by hunters. This latter factor is certainly true at the landscape scale: Large-antlered Muntjac primarily uses lower altitudes, yet forest blocks remote enough for hunting levels to be restrained by the economics of access and removal of meat are primarily mountainous areas of high altitude forest. If Large-antlered Muntjac is an edge species, densities in large un-encroached closed forest blocks would be low anyway. The lower-altitude disturbed forests may be the most suitable habitat for this muntjac, but because they are closer to high human population densities than are montane or little-encroached blocks, they support higher levels of generalised snaring and hunting. In comparison, Northern Red Muntjac has large populations in such high-altitude remote forest blocks, which may act as a repopulation reservoir for lower altitude areas. It is difficult to think of any habitat that could be a source for Large-antlered Muntjac. Since 2008 there have been no new observations to suggest that the above speculation is not broadly accurate, whilst new camera-trapping data solidifies the assumption that the species is primarily associated with forests below c. 1,000 m.<br/><br/>While demand for wild meat is the major driver of muntjac trade, parts such as antlers may be used for medicinal purposes. There is also the curio/status symbol appeal of trophy antlers: some are even on display in Bangkok (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2000). Since 2008 there appears to have been an upsurge in the trade in trophy antlers (of all species), to the extent that it is now often difficult to find Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages, the trade appears to favour trophies with large antlers (Timmins 2013a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), one can only speculate that this will inevitably increase pressure on the species.<br/><br/>The effects of hunting in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant seem to be:<br/><br/>Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Sage and Nguyen Cu (2001) and Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola, the main driver of threats for Saola, Large-antlered Muntjac and many other species, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). If anything, trade has grown since 2008, and become more sophisticated, this appears particularly so in Lao PDR, as its border with Viet Nam has become increasingly opened up by new roads and upgrading of old border crossings (R.J. Timmins pers. comm 2015).<br/><br/>Road development in Viet Nam, especially the recent construction through the Annamite Mountains in Viet Nam of the Ho Chi Minh Highway, parallel to the Lao border, with its many feeder roads to Lao PDR and Cambodia that boost connectivity of rural areas to regional wildlife trade markets, is a severe and probably unmitigatable threat (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). From the late 1990s there has also been a dramatic upgrading and expansion of national and regional road networks in Lao PDR, primarily it seems to make all inhabited areas of the country readily accessible (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). New road linkages in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, are making the area’s natural resources more easily marketable (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Since 2008 road development and upgrading has continued and probably even increased in intensity especially in what were once remote border areas (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press a,b).<br/><br/>Shifting cultivation of local communities is resulting in a net loss of forest and even of dense secondary habitats, and is fragmenting larger forest blocks because of the dispersion of settlements. Shifting cultivation per se could even be beneficial for this muntjac, but recent trends are decreasing the suitability of what might be called ‘the shifting cultivation estate’. These trends centre round a decline in cycle length in rotational systems (hindering regrowth during the fallow period), partly through the increasing number of people depending upon an annually decreasing area, as forest land is lost to infrastructure, tree plantation crops and other forms of continuous agriculture, and partly through well-intentioned government policy to eradicate shifting cultivation. Habitat loss due to shifting cultivation has probably increased in intensity in many habitats of most relevance to the species since 2008, e.g. peripheral degraded forest at mid elevation (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press a,b) especially in the southern Annamites of Viet Nam where rubber, pine and acacia plantations are targeted on secondary forest patches.<br/><br/>Recent moves towards landscape-scale habitat clearance for agro-industrial developments particularly in plateau areas of Cambodia and southern Viet Nam, and even in foothill areas of northern parts of the Lao and Vietnamese range of the species, would presumably remove available habitat, further fragment remaining forest areas, increase local affluence and result in new roads. However, this muntjac’s potential use of plantations is not assessed, and probably cannot be, because all such developments are increasing the area in which hunting is easy and at high levels (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Since 2008 as with most other threats, habitat loss from concessions appears to be on the increase, with for instance large areas of plateau forest already lost in the Southern Annamites (Timmins in press a).<br/><br/>Hydropower development throughout the Annamites, particularly in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading basin in Lao PDR, floods habitat but more importantly fuels hunting levels through increasing access, affluence and market connectivity. The Nakai Plateau, part of the only area known still to support good numbers of Large-antlered Muntjac, was flooded for a hydropower headpond during mid 2008. This destroyed part of the species' range on the plateau, but the project will continue to stimulate hunting. Currently, there are barely-navigable stretches of rocky channel (called kengs) on all streams flowing out from the NPA. All these kengs will be easily passable when the reservoir is full. As predicted the Nam Theun 2 reservoir has had a huge negative effect on remaining plateau areas and the NPA (W.G. Robichaud and J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2015). Nam Kading NPA, further down the same catchment, is also threatened by a hydropower project which will result in a highly dendritic headpond allowing ready access to most of this NPA and so undoubtedly will increase hunting levels significantly. Other reservoirs have in the interim been completed in both Lao PDR (e.g. on the Nam Gnouang) and Viet Nam (e.g., a reservoir abutting the Hue SNR) surely leading to similar consequences (Timmins in press b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Growing economic stability and developing infrastructure in all three range countries have initiated a flood of proposals for industrial-scale mineral extraction, particularly in the mineral-rich Annamites (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The effects of this on proportionate loss of habitat remain to be seen, they will probably be overshadowed the presence of large numbers of non-local workers with good market connectivity and thus a propensity to hunt, or to pay local people to hunt. In 2015 expansion of mineral concessions has perhaps not been as dramatic as feared, although there are still plans and rumours concerning concessions in many areas, and small-scale gold mining operations are present in many relatively remote forest areas (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press b).<br/><br/>Recent changes in immigration agreements between Lao PDR and Viet Nam and between Lao PDR and China make it much easier for Vietnamese and Chinese people to visit, settle in and conduct business in Lao PDR, and with a clear build-up of Vietnamese nationals in pivotal wildlife trade centres such as Ban Lak-20 (= ‘Ban Lak Xao’) on the edge of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, trade networks with Viet Nam are now better than ever and still improving (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional factors hindering the species' survival include:<br/><br/>The difficulties of distinction between this species and Northern Red Muntjac impede its potential legal protection, particularly in situations where a differential status between the Large-antlered and Northern Red applies.<br/><br/>Customary rights of local people to hunt ‘sustainably’ within most Lao and some Vietnamese protected areas urgently need modification if most of the ungulate species are to survive in such areas (see the Conservation Measures section).<br/><br/>As pointed out by Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007), protected area management skills and commitment to the system are still evolving in the Annamites, and this progress lags behind expansion of market-led hunting. Currently, existing protected areas are not stanching declines in ungulates. Protected areas have so far proven impotent in the control of poaching or as a mechanism to safeguard areas from economic development such as hydropower projects, road construction, and mining (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). It will require a major consolidation of effort to install effective anti-hunting measures in any protected area within the range of Large-antlered Muntjac within the next five years (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and protected area strengthening projects should be thinking in terms of a few decades of collaboration, not a few years (e.g., Leisher 2001). Yet, there is even the danger of the few currently promising protected areas regressing through loss of external funding and talented professionals, ongoing political indifference towards them, and thereby forcing an unfettered short-termism in local residents’ behaviour through a lack of alternative options. There is no plausible method to conserve this species (and others of high value to the wildlife trade which show little resilience to hunting) alternative to protected areas, the problem is arising not through a flawed concept, but through naive optimism about the time-scales and resource inputs needed to effect situational change, coupled with insufficient political will to enact effective protected area management by all range state governments.<br/><br/>The potential of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA to conserve the species has fallen far short of expectations. The area receives substantial, guaranteed annual funding from the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project (approximately USD 1 million annually), in compensation for reservoir inundation of wildlife habitat on the Nakai Plateau. As of 2015, after nearly a decade of over USD 1 million being spent per year by the NPA’s management, there is little progress in restraining offtake of ungulates and other wildlife. This reflects low starting capacity resulting from inappropriate staff selection policies, a poorly structured capacity-building programme, no link between performance and provision of annual budget, internal financial irregularities and, most trenchantly, uneven commitment to the protected area’s aims internally, and from the mass of other government bodies with influence over WMPA.. National-level government policy favours tangible aspects of rural development (road building, plantation agriculture, etc.) over what is perceived as ‘wildlife conservation’. Corruption that both protects and promotes the unsustainable offtake of natural resources (e.g., forest timber, wildlife for trade) is also a major issue. The situation reached a crisis point in 2014 when two external reviews corroborated the Nam Theun 2 project’s own International Environmental and Social Panel of Experts’ long-standing and intensifying concerns over continued gross underperformance, and the panel recommended dissolution of the WMPA management structure (McDowell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). As of late 2015, most WMPA senior staff have in fact been removed, but their replacements have not yet been appointed.<br/><br/>In Bolikhamxay Province to the north, some progress has been made in wildlife conservation, particularly through a decade-long cooperative program between the province and the Wildlife Conservation Society. However, ongoing restriction by the province and central government for program personnel to enter some of the most important areas in the Annamites along the border of Viet Nam, due to unspecified ‘security concerns’, considerably hamper attempts to conserve rare ungulates there if still present, such as Saola and Large-antlered Muntjac.<br/><br/>The only site within the species’ range where levels of law enforcement patrolling and protected management are close to levels required to reduce threats to Large-antlered Muntjac are the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves in central Viet Nam, and possibly some focal areas of Nakai-Nam Theun. However even at these sites it is likely that few, if any, areas are either sufficiently remote, or patrolled with sufficient regularity or intensity, to remove threats to the species. In addition there are no confirmed recent records of Large-antlered Muntjac from the two reserves in Viet Nam, which clearly suffered extensive hunting prior to gazettement, and the species may have become extinct from these sites. Adjacent areas of eastern Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR, receive little protection and despite efforts to establish enforcement teams with similar mandates as within Hue and Quang Nam, current patrol intensity and levels of snare removal are not close to that required. It should be noted that snare removal in these sites is conducted primarily by trained, local community members, with ranger assistance and support from WWF, not primarily by government staff.<br/><br/>There is a lack of appreciation in the decision-making levels relevant to protected areas, including those with externally collaborative management support projects, of the biodiversity value of lower altitude yet degraded forests relative to high altitude forests which have been less encroached. This results in mis-prioritisation of core protected zones within protected areas. The common situation is that all lower-altitude forests are degraded, and it is this very degradation that makes them of high priority: their conservation status is already so poor that there are no pristine areas left in most of the range of the Large-antlered Muntjac. This is a problem for a wide suite of species restricted to the lower altitudes, not just to this muntjac, but because of its globally small range, it may be the mammal at most global risk through this factor (with the possible exception of Saola).","Evidence for the Large-antlered Muntjac comes from much of the Annamite mountain range, mostly as trophy antlers in villages abutting or within forest (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Do Tuoc and Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 1990s, B. Long pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2006, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014, Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2015). The very little field-based evidence of Large-antlered Muntjac contrasts with Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis </em>being among the most frequently recorded large mammals during field surveys in Lao and Viet Nam (Timmins in press b, Timmins 2013a, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In most known Lao sites holding Large-antlered Muntjac, few trophies were found compared with those of Northern Red Muntjac, the only exception is the Nakai Plateau and Nakai–Nam Theun NPA where, overall, numbers of trophies of the two species were roughly equal, and which constitute the only area of Lao PDR in which trophy evidence was found commonly over a wide area (Schaller and Vrba 1996, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998). Around the Nam Noy and Nam Phao river basins, Large-antlered Muntjac trophies even outnumber those of Northern Red Muntjac (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on surveys in 2007–2008). Distribution and relative abundance in the Xe Sap NPA–Dakchung&#160; area, based on the frequency of trophy antlers discovered in villages, another region of the main Annamite spine visited several times appears, by contrast, to be patchy (Timmins 2013a, Schaller and Vrba 1996, Showler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Steinmetz 1998, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998).<br/><br/>During 1998–1999, camera-trapping in Bolikhamxay Province recorded the species only twice (Robichaud and Stuart 1999), which at the time seemed a relatively low ‘encounter’ rate, however given the relatively low effort (probably less than 1,800 trap nights W. Robichaud pers. comm. 2015) in comparison to some recent camera-trapping surveys it now seems noteworthy (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). More recent but somewhat limited camera-trapping in Phou Chomvoy PPA and Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area, both areas almost certainly within the historical range of Large-antlered Muntjac, did not detect the species (Timmins in press b, IEWMP unpublished data, Chanthasone_Phommachanh unpublished data), and as already mentioned the species has not been detected by camera-trapping in Nam Kading NPA, although this may be due to camera-trapping being largely in ecologically unsuitable areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014 based on WCS unpublished data). A substantial and widespread camera-trapping effort conducted over several years from 2006–2011 in the Nakai–Nam Theun NPA and other areas of the Nakai Plateau recorded many Large-antlered Muntjacs in some sectors in a ‘trap’ encounter rate similar to that of Northern Red Muntjac there (Coudrat <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014a, Robichaud <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of Watershed Management and Protection Authority [WMPA] unpublished camera-trapping data). The plateau and NPA’s Large-antlered Muntjac population stood out as exceptionally large both in the mid 1990s (when it could be compared with many other sites surveyed using comparable methodology) and in a mid-2000s context (despite a paucity of contemporary similar studies in other sites). In an Indochinese context, the Nakai Plateau and Nakai-Nam Theun NPA were found in 1994–1996 to hold substantial populations of other wildlife which have declined steeply through over-harvest in Indochina. Recent (2006–2007) surveys of the plateau showed that some had by then gone, such as Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>), but others, such as turtles, otters, Asian Elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>), and, of most direct relevance to inferring the status of this muntjac, Sambar (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>) remained in numbers outstandingly high compared with other areas surveyed about the same time (Dersu 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). However, occupation of the NPA seems somewhat patchy, not just for ecological reasons: in one of the sectors where camera-trapping was carried out, no Large-antlered Muntjacs were found, although Northern Red Muntjac and the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex were recorded frequently (Robichaud <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.), at the time of the camera-trapping this coincided with the area of the NPA thought on the basis of several lines of evidence to be most heavily affected by hunting (both from Lao and Viet Namese hunters) (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In June–July 2010 a short duration camera-trapping project was conducted in Laving Laveun Provincial Protected Area (PPA), in Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR, in forest close to the border with Viet Nam and apparently transitional in nature with Wet Evergreen Forest. This resulted in nine independent detections from seven camera locations, and a further five probable detections from a further two camera locations (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Northern Red Muntjac was not certainly camera trapped during the survey, although animals in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex were recorded (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Recent camera-trapping in Xe Sap NPA has so far failed to detect Large-antlered Muntjac, although 74% of 4,630 trap-days was at elevations above 1,000 m (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data, Gray and Thongsamouth in prep), surveys in 2011 also did not find any Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages around the periphery of the NPA (Timmins 2013a).<br/><br/>In general, surveys undertaken throughout Lao PDR suggest that typical quarry species of large mammal are well below carrying capacity even within large habitat blocks (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins and Duckworth 2008), and the paucity of evidence for the Large-antlered Muntjac elsewhere in its Lao range indicates a conservation status similar to that of wild oxen or large hornbills, rather than to that of other ungulates of comparable size such as other muntjac species or wild pigs. Camera-trapping in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2011 appears to indicate significant declines of ground-dwelling large mammal populations especially Sambar, cats and some small carnivores, by comparison with direct observation and sign surveys in 1994–1996, intensive snaring is now commonplace within the NPA and the area has particularly suffered from incursion from over the Vietnamese border (Coudrat <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014 a,b; Duckworth 1998; Evans <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000; RJT pers. comm. 2008 based on WMPA unpublished data; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). However snaring is still likely to be only a fraction of the intensity of that on average in the majority of Vietnamese Annamite forests (at least those that retain any large mammals of commercial value), and of particular significance in terms of assessing status and trends of large mammals, snaring has only been at a significantly high level in a majority of the NPA for a relatively short time (probably less than 10 years) compared with the considerably more prolonged duration of snaring on average in Vietnamese forests and some other border areas of Lao PDR (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Although muntjacs of all species are still apparently numerous in Nakai Nam Theun NPA, significant declines are almost certainly in progress, as on the Nakai Plateau (the semi-quantitative methods used have low power to detect changes even of quite large proportion, if the species is still ‘common’). Elsewhere in Lao PDR over the same period, anecdotal information and a small number of re-surveys suggest that declines in mammals of muntjac size and over (in magnitude obvious even by subjective survey means) are widespread (Timmins and Duckworth 2012; Duckworth in press; Timmins 2013a; Suford 2010; Timmins 2009; Timmins in press a,b; Timmins and Robichaud 2005; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008 but based largely on areas outside the Large-antlered Muntjac’s range).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam the situation seems to be if anything considerably worse, with no evidence for anything other than very small numbers surviving, although one area which seems to have held large numbers at least into the 1990s has not been re-surveyed. In and around Pu Mat National Park, despite a number of trophies in local villages in the 1990s, fairly intensive camera-trapping in the late 1990s resulted in perhaps only one image of Large-antlered Muntjac compared with dozens portraying Northern Red Muntjac and several showing animals of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> group (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, SFNC 2000, RJT pers. obs. based on SFNC unpublished data). However, the spatial overlap between the areas providing the village trophies and where camera-trapping took place is not known. More recent surveys in Pu Mat National Park, from 2012 and 2013, indicate that ungulate densities have declined precipitously from previous years, suggesting that if anything the situation has worsened (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2015).&#160; Slightly further south in Vu Quang Nature Reserve, Dawson and Do Tuoc (1997) considered Large-antlered Muntjac as common as Northern Red Muntjac, an assessment echoing that from the adjacent Lao area of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA and Nakai Plateau (see above). However, Eve <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2001: 45 and 122) concluded a major decline at Vu Quang NR during the 1990s: Dawson (1994) recorded that 13 Large-antlered Muntjacs were caught in snares in the 1993/1994 season alone, and observed one Large-antlered Muntjac in the southern part of the reserve at this time, but in several years’ presence, including various biological surveys, in the late 1990s, no new evidence of the species was recorded.<br/><br/>From Vu Quang NR southwards, there are, as in Lao PDR, sporadic records of trophies, but little information other than, in many instances, anecdotal reports of the species’ scarcity (see the Distribution section).<br/><br/>In Khe Nuoc Trong proposed nature reserve, Le Thuy District, Quang Binh Province, Large-antlered Muntjac was camera-trapped at least once (with two other provisionally identified records) during 2011–2014, all below 200 m elevation over the course of 9,200 trap days using 100 camera-traps (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Extensive camera-trapping in Thua Tien Hue and Quang Nam Provinces between 2002–2006 captured only a single possible Large-antlered Muntjac against numerous pictures of Northern Red Muntjac and several animals of the <em>M. rooseveltorum </em>species-complex (Dickinson and Van Ngoc Thinh 2006, Long 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). More recently between 2012 and 2014 greater than 19,000 camera-trap days from 127 locations largely below 1000 m in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves did not detect the species with certainty (WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). This suggests a current rarity that seems to reflect a steep recent decline rather than naturally low densities based on interviews of villagers throughout Quang Nam, Hue and Quang Tri provinces (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). This is corroborated by camera-trapping results for other species, i.e. Sambar only detected from five of 127 locations, Saola only detected from a single location and Crested Argus only detected from two locations (WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data), interview data for Saola based partly on the remains of hunted animals which indicate a significant decline in reports over time (N.M. Wilkinson pers. comm. 2012, 2014, Turvey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and field surveys which have found evidence of high hunting intensity and low abundance of all ungulates in the majority of areas (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2014, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In the mid 1990s, two Hanoi institutes obtained five freshly hunted animals from the Lam Ha District, Lam Dong Province in the Southern Annamites (see Distribution) where the species was said to be relatively common (Do Tuoc and Pham Trong Anh pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins). The Da Lat Biology Institute in Lam Dong Province began amassing specimens in 1990 and by October 1995 held only 271 mammal specimens. Remarkably, 19 (in translation: six stuffed mounts, four skinned heads (skulls?) and 9 skins (trophies?)) of these were of <em>M. vuquangensis</em>, against only 12 <em>M. vaginalis</em>. These were the two most numerous mammal species in the collection (Pham Trong Anh <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1996). It is not known if the institute deliberately sought Large-antlered Muntjac, or whether the numbers reflect the relative frequency with which animals were being hunted. The only somewhat relevant survey traced within that region since, a survey of Chu Yang Sin NP, in an adjacent area of Dak Lak Province, camera-trapped the species on a single occasion (BirdLife International 2010, details of survey effort are not given). Given the lack of traced information from Lam Dong present conservation status of Large-antlered Muntjac there is unknown. Southern Viet Nam had in previous decades often proven to harbour less depleted large mammal populations than further north (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Polet and Ling 2004), however this may no longer be the case over much of the south, with evidence that hunting intensity and forest loss has greatly increased and become much more similar to the situation in the centre and north (see Threats). In Viet Nam, especially the north, large mammal densities are, in general, even more depressed than in Lao PDR (Tilker 2014, Willcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Timmins in press a, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001, Timmins 2002, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).",Decreasing,"The Large-antlered Muntjac is known only from the Annamite mountain chain and associated hill ranges of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and, marginally, eastern Cambodia. All current records from Cambodia, like many from Lao PDR and most from Viet Nam, are trophy antlers held by local hunters (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006, 2015). Large-antlered Muntjac does not inhabit the northern highlands of Lao PDR or Viet Nam, nor the Mekong plain. Its distribution and status in Lao PDR were reviewed by Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (1998), but no comparable compilation is available for Viet Nam. There have been no significant extensions of known Lao range since this collation. <br/><br/>In neither Lao PDR nor Viet Nam is there any marked discontinuity in landforms between the Annamite range and the northern highlands. Yet Large-antlered Muntjac seems not to extend into the latter region as defined in Baltzer <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2001). In particular, extensive camera-trapping in Nam Et – Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR, where mammal populations are, in regional terms, reasonably healthy, has not detected the species despite hundreds of photographs of muntjacs being obtained. It should be noted that the majority of camera locations were at elevations greater than 1,000 m, which are potentially naturally unsuitable for the species (Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Its trophies have been reported furthest to the north-east from the Pu Huong Nature Reserve, Nghe An Province, Viet Nam (Cao Tien Trung and A. Grieser Johns pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2008). Searches further north in Viet Nam have not found the species (e.g., Le Trong Trai <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999c, Le Trong Trai and Do Tuoc pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins in the 1990s). The most northerly evidence in the main Annamite spine is from Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province on the Vietnamese side and from southern Bolikhamxay Province on the Lao side, with presence also to the west in southern Nam Kading NPA (Schaller and Vrba 1996, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, SFNC 2000, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, the species might yet be found as far north as southern Xiangkhouang Province and Xaysomboun Province, which remain largely unsurveyed, as does most of intervening northern Bolikhamxay Province. The species’s westward limit is unclear, but presence may be localised and dependent on favourable ecological conditions in combination with historical patterns of anthropogenic forest use, with perhaps much lower natural ecological densities in what presumably are suboptimal habitats in the ‘drier’ western regions of central Lao PDR. Relatively extensive camera-trapping in Nam Kading NPA has not detected the species, even in areas where ungulates were clearly still reasonably common for the region, suggesting to some degree a natural pattern, however much of the camera-trapping was apparently at relatively high elevations, and furthermore the southeastern part of the NPA where trophies had been found in peripheral villages in the 1990s was not covered well by camera-trapping (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on WCS unpublished data/Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network unpublished data).<br/><br/>South of southern Bolikhamxay Province and southern Nam Kading NPA in Lao PDR, evidence of Large-antlered Muntjac has been found in the Annamites, particularly Nakai–Nam Theun NPA and the Nakai Plateau, and outlying hill ranges including the foothills in and around Phou Xang He NPA, Xe Bang-Nouan NPA and Dong Phou Vieng NPA, the Lao–Vietnamese border area in the region of Hin Namno NPA, south of there in Laving Laveun Provincial Protected Area, and the main body of the central Annamites in Xe Sap NPA, the Dakchung Plateau and Dong Ampham NPA (Timmins 2013a, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Schaller and Vrba 1996, Davidson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Steinmetz 1998, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Robichaud <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep.). Based on the results from Nam Kading it seems likely that in outlying hill ranges such as Phou Xang He and Xe Bang Nouan the species was naturally always localised.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, south of Pu Mat National Park, the Large-antlered Muntjac has been recorded in several Annamite sites including Vu Quang Nature Reserve (now National Park), Ha Tinh Province (Dawson and Do Tuoc 1997, Eve <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001: 45 and 122). From Vu Quang NP southwards, there are, as in Lao PDR, sporadic records of trophies, but little other information save for anecdotal reports of the species’s scarcity (Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Le Trong Trai and Richardson 1999, Le Trong Trai <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999a, 1999b, 2001, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001, Le Manh Hung <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Thua Thien Hue Province Forest Protection Department, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam Provinces: B. Long, Kon Plong area, Kon Tum Province: Do Tuoc, A Luoi District, Thua Thien Hue Province and Kon Cha Rang NR, Gia Lai province: Le Trong Trai, all pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins). In the mid 1990s the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute and the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources obtained two and three, respectively, freshly hunted animals from the Lam Ha District, Lam Dong Province in the Southern Annamites (a region often referred to as the Lang Bian or Dalat Plateau), which they mounted as specimens for the respective institutions (Do Tuoc and Pham Trong Anh pers. comm. to RJT). The Da Lat Biology Institute in Lam Dong in October 1995 held 19 <em>M. vuquangensis</em>, reportedly mostly from some or all of the districts of Lac Duong, Di Linh, Bao Loc and Lam Ha (Pham Trong Anh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1996). This area is also one of the few with reasonable historical evidence for Large-antlered Muntjac (Millet 1930, Bauer 1997). No published recent survey has determined the conservation status of the Large-antlered Muntjac in this area, and its southern limit remains poorly known, although the species presumably does not occur south of the southern slopes of the Southern Annamites.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, the Large-antlered Muntjac is known only through trophy antlers seen in villages and markets of the Mondulkiri Plateau (Desai and Lic 1996, Timmins and Ou 2001, Walston 2001). It is probably very localised: extensive camera-trapping at low elevations on the southern slope in Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area has not detected the species (J.L. Walston and T.D. Evans pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins based on WCS unpublished data, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of WCS camera-trap images in 2011), and at higher elevations closed canopy semi-evergreen forest forms a mosaic with deciduous forests, savanna and grassland, the latter are believed to be unsuitable for the species (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Slight doubt over provenance of trophies in Mondulkiri reflects the heavy trade with Viet Nam (albeit mostly to Viet Nam from Cambodia) and lack of influence on hunters’ movements of the international border. On ecological grounds there seems little question that this muntjac should occur in Cambodia, although it may already have been hunted out.<br/><br/>CBD and BGMNP (2012) state that three individuals of this species were camera-trapped during a project run by Bu Gia Map NP in Binh Phuoc Province, southern Viet Nam, on the border with Siema BCA. A picture of a muntjac labelled as “Mang lớn <em>Megamuntiacus vuquangensis</em>?” (CBD and BGMNP 2012: pg 45) is unclear, but is almost certainly not a Large-antlered Muntjac, no further details of the camera-trapping project or the purported Large-antlered Muntjac photos are given (Timmins <em>in press</em> a). Given the propensity in general for camera-trap photos to be misidentified (e.g., AWCSG–GWC 2011) and the subtle differences between Large-antlered and Northern Red Muntjacs (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) it is best that these reports are discounted until the pictures can be independently verified (Timmins <em>in press</em> a).","Large-antlered Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture which abounds in all range states and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand. Hunters do not target Large-antlered Muntjacs, but are seeking any and all species with marketable meat and products for the medicinal markets. Such hunting reaches all this muntjac’s range, and with so many species and products, non-selective methods continue at high levels until the most resilient species is no longer common enough for hunting to be commercially viable. This non-specificity makes regional hunting practices a peculiarly strong driver of localised and, in aggregate, regional, extinctions (e.g., Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). While demand for wild meat is the major driver of muntjac trade, parts such as antlers may be used for medicinal purposes. There is also the curio/status symbol appeal of trophy antlers: some are even on display in Bangkok (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2000). Since 2008 there appears to have been an upsurge in the trade in trophy antlers (of all species), to the extent that it is now often difficult to find Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages, the trade appears to favour trophies with large antlers (Timmins 2013a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), one can only speculate that this will inevitably increase pressure on the species. Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES – Appendix I.<br/><br/>The survival of the Large-antlered Muntjac depends on the viability of populations within protected areas, many of which (particularly in Lao PDR) are currently potentially highly suitable for the species due to their typically large size (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 1998, see also Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Timmins and Duckworth 2008). Although Large-antlered Muntjac populations within protected areas face unrestrained hunting, populations outside protected areas are likely to be faring even less well. The limited success to-date for protected areas is a reflection of the time it takes to form an effectively functioning system (see threats), rather than a demonstration that the species would better be conserved outside them. Actions of primary importance include the stemming of further habitat loss at lower altitudes and, most importantly, controls on hunting (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 1998).<br/><br/>The single most important conservation measure for the Large-antlered Muntjac is to develop an effective conservation management system in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, and to help strengthen protection activities there, especially through building technical capacity, and the appointment of senior staff with motivation to conserve wildlife. Initiation of effective protection and management in Laving–Laveun NPA is similarly important, as it may be in a contiguous provincial protected area to the north of Laving-Laveun, Khoun Xe Nong Ma PPA, in Khammouane Province, Lao PDR. As of late 2015, the Nam Theun 2-funded protected area management project for Nakai-Nam Theun has made minimal progress despite receiving many million dollars (see ‘Threats’). Xe Sap NPA, in southern Laos, has recently been the beneficiary of a large conservation project, ""Carbon and Biodiversity"" (CarBi), coordinated by WWF and funded mainly by the German development bank, KfW. Components of the project have focused on training and supervising a small number of anti-poaching patrols in Xe Sap. Unfortunately, as of 2015, project funds for Xe Sap patrolling were nearly exhausted. Few other protected areas within the Lao or Vietnamese range of the species currently have more than paper protection. Conservation management needs much wider recognition of the value of lower-altitude forests in protected areas throughout the species’ range (see the Threats section).<br/><br/>The status of the species is very little understood in the southern Annamites and so a focus there should be on status assessments. If sites are found with significant numbers then they would automatically become priorities for enhanced management and protection.<br/><br/>At its meeting in 2013, the Saola Working Group of the IUCN SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, adopted a “zero threats” goal for Saola priority areas, that is, that the protection goal should be “…zero active snares (and other traps that pose risk to Saola), zero domestic hunting dogs and zero illegal firearms in priority Saola areas” (Saola Working Group 2013). The rationale for this goal is that for a Critically Endangered species like Saola, any level of snaring or hunting where some Saolas might survive presents a significant threat to the species’ survival. With Large-antlered Muntjac now also elevated to Critically Endangered, the same “zero threats” goal is likewise appropriate.<br/><br/>Conservation breeding is often proposed when animals are in imminent danger of extinction, a point at which in some, perhaps many, cases it may be too late to save the species by any means. As Large-antlered Muntjac appears to be following a status trajectory similar to that of Saola, a species for which conservation breeding is now recognised as the priority intervention (albeit later than would have been optimal), it would be prudent to initiate conservation breeding as soon as possible for Large-antlered Muntjac. Conservation breeding for Saola could theoretically be relatively easily combined with that for Large-antlered Muntjac. As for Saola, there are no known Large-antlered Muntjacs in captivity anywhere in the world today, so such a program would have to start from zero. Fortunately, for the time-being, Large-antlered Muntjac remains relatively easily detectable within probably at least two areas of Lao PDR, making capture potentially possible less challenging.<br/><br/>Considering the genetic distance between the animals in the northern-central Annamites and the southern Annamites, a conservation breeding program may well be needed in southern Vietnam also.<br/><br/>Management in all protected areas within the species’s range must address the issues of how customary hunting by local people can be reconciled with the conservation of Critically Endangered species. The magnitude of difficulty of this balancing act is often underestimated, through an uncritical acceptance of the fact (in any case, disputable, when status of rhinoceroses in South-east Asia and a multitude of species in south-central China is considered) that before ‘international’ conservation principles and practice these species did not become extinct under the custodianship of customary hunting. This is a flawed comparison because in the intervening period human populations have exploded, much wildlife habitat has been lost to other land uses, modern weapons allow far more effective harvest of wildlife than did any customary techniques, and modern connectivity and urban affluence have generated a limitless market for wild meat (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012). In sum, many more people depend on a far smaller area than before, and a new, infinite market can be met using hunting methods which previously did not exist. This means that there is no possibility that unfettered ‘customary’ hunting can conserve ungulates in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, even if ‘customary hunting’ could be defined in a modern context. Greater recognition is also urgent that the two groups that will chiefly bear the damage of current heavy hunting are, self-evidently, the wildlife and, perhaps paradoxically, the local communities: after the current short-term bonanza is over, local people who have not bought their way out of subsistence (and current trends suggest this will be a large proportion of them: most of the financial benefits of wildlife trade flow to already-urbanised traders and other adventives) will lose this income source and most of their non-fish protein. Instead of the currently sterile polarisation within conservation implementing agencies of ‘local people vs wildlife’, which would better be termed ‘short-term human interest vs long-term human interest’, universal recognition that wild mammals are fundamental to rural poverty alleviation is needed (Krahn and Johnson 2007). Inviolate non-hunting core areas may be the most important tool in meeting this challenge. Even though they can legally be established in protected areas in both countries, there has been minimal progress in generating on-ground reality in this regard. Designation and outlining of core areas needs to flow from biologically sound analyses of population needs of species such as the Large-antlered Muntjac, to prevent core areas too small to sustain off-take in surrounding hunting zones or even survival within the core zones themselves. It is important that core areas are not selected starting from the assumption that they will be the areas traditionally not part of local community hunting areas: in many protected areas, these will be remote high-altitude terrain, and thus largely unsuitable for Large-antlered Muntjac. There is the danger that this occurs through the well-meaning intention, to minimise disruption to already marginalized communities. Instead, a longer-term viewpoint is necessary, that if core areas do not succeed in protecting populations of favoured quarry mammals, serious dietary and resource-flow disruption to these same communities is inevitable. It is already happening in some parts of Lao PDR (Krahn and Johnson 2007) and, presumably, Viet Nam.<br/><br/>Surveys for the Large-antlered Muntjac (a combination of searches for evidence in local villages followed by camera-trapping) in Vietnamese portions of the Southern Annamites, especially Lam Dong Province, are needed, and on the basis of results, site-based conservation interventions may be warranted. The same may be true for yet-to-be identified areas of the southern Central Annamites. The weak understanding of Large-antlered Muntjac’s habitat use means that any indirect means (e.g. through habitat cover) to propose key sites for conservation intervention may simply overlook not just the best, but even any plausibly sensible, areas to select.<br/><br/>The Cambodian population, if extant, may be covered partly by the one or more protected areas (Phnom Nam Lyr WS, Mondulkiri Protection Forest, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area), other parts of it might, however, occur outside these areas. There are, however, no serious protection activities within its presumed national range. Camera-trapping surveys are warranted, and on the basis of results localised species-specific conservation interventions might be appropriate.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Pressure on the habitat&#160;has increased due to resettlement of victims of typhoon Haiyan, and squatting of outsiders in Busuanga (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).","The species occurs in grasslands, open woodlands and second-growth forest (Hoogstraal 1951). It has a gestation length of approximately 180 days, with typically one young, and rarely twins. Age at sexual maturity is 8-12 months, with a life span of 12-20 years. This species is diurnal, browses on leaves, and lives in small herds (Wemmer 1998). This species has a group size up to 27 individuals, but usually 7–14 (with much smaller groups reported in heavily hunted areas; Oliver and Villamor1992).","The species is threatened due to hunting pressure and human settlement and agricultural expansion over its very limited range, coupled by the evident lack of effective and sustained enforcement of the strong local protective legislation (W. Oliver pers. comm. and unpubl.). Hunting was particularly severe during the mid-1970s (Grimwood 1976), but seemingly declined in most areas during the 1980s and 1990s, except on Calauit where hunting pressure increased dramatically following the resettlement of the island by former residents under the auspices of the ‘Balik (Back to) Calauit Movement’. In 1986, 51 out of the 256 families evicted from the island ten years earlier had re-settled on the island, and by 1992 the settlers numbered nearly 500 people (Oliver 1993, W. Oliver pers. comm.). Much of the hunting of the species is recreational, and also to provide venison to the local markets (W. Oliver pers. comm.).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">More recently, pressure on the habitat has increased (and presumably hunting pressure also), due to resettlements of victims of typhoon Haiyan, and squatting of outsiders in Busuanga (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;On Calauit, introduced African ungulate populations are increasing but are probably not competing with Calamian Deer (Calauit was originally stocked with giraffe, zebra, impala, waterbuck, gazelle, eland, topi and bushbuck acquired from Kenya). A presidential proclamation that precluded removal or control of exotic species, and the movement or management of Calamian Deer on Calauit Island was recently amended, thereby also potentially enabling the better future control of the exotic ungulate populations, though in fact many of these populations have also been seriously reduced by poaching. While relatively large parts of Busuanga and Culion Islands are still undeveloped and sparsely inhabited, there are no proper reserves on either.","The species was reputedly common in all suitable localities throughout the main islands of Busuanga and Culion in the 1940s, but to have drastically declined in numbers on all parts of these islands, except in the extreme south of Culion, by the mid-1970s (Grimwood 1976). A small population of deer surviving on Calauit Island at that time was supplemented by a further 30 translocated individuals in 1977 (J. Gapuz pers. comm.), following the creation of the 'Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary' in 1976, and the eviction and resettlement of the islands former residents (Oliver 1993, Oliver and Villamor 1993). By April 1994, Calauit was reported to hold an estimated population of 1,123 ± 236 individuals (Orig and Rosell 1994); though more recent estimates indicate significant reductions in the numbers of these animals numbers following resettlement of the island by former residents and resurgence of hunting pressure. A survey in 2006 (Rico and Oliver 2008) showed the species still to be widespread on Calauit, Busuanga and Culion, though densities remain low in many areas (W. Oliver pers. comm.). It was also found still to be present on the islands of Marily and Dimaquiat.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In 2010 a field survey conducted on Busuanga (18 days), Culion (15 days) and Coron (2 days) did not record the species from any of the six surveyed sites, but secondary information indicates presence in at least four sites (Paguntalan <em>et al.</em> 2010).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Philippines, where it is restricted to the Calamian Islands in the Palawan faunal region. The species occurs on three of the four larger islands in Calamians, i.e. Busuanga, Calauit and Culion, but is absent from Coron (Oliver 1993, Oliver and Villamor 1993, Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998, Grubb 2005). The species is also reported to have occurred on at least nine other smaller islands, including three islands where small numbers of individuals translocated from Calauit were released in the late 1980s (Oliver and Villamor 1993). However, it was reported to be extinct on at least seven (78%) of these islands (Bacbac, Capari, Panlaitan, Galoc, Apo, Alava and Dicabaito), and to survive on only two of these islands, namely Marily and Dimaquiat (Rico and Oliver 2008). It is not known from anywhere else in the region, including mainland Palawan, nor the larger and intervening of island of Linacapan.","This species is hunted for food by local people, who also use hides for drums and antlers for decoration.",Terrestrial,"Calamian Deer&#160;occurs in the Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary (37.4 km<sup>2</sup>), which was established in 1976 to protect a collection of free-ranging African ungulates (see under Threats). Protection is inadequate and there are no management plans (Oliver 1993). Several hundred local people were evicted at that time it was established, but many of these have since returned to settle illegally (Oliver and Villamor 1993). Thirty animals were introduced to Calauit in 1977 to supplement a small relict population (Orig and Rosell 1994).<br/><br/>The following conservation actions are recommended:<br/><ol><li>Monitor current status on all the three islands and determine population trends.

22156866,41789,Rusa timorensis,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Javan Deer is still locally common within its rather small native geographic range, but is assessed as Vulnerable (C1) because its total native population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within three generations (estimated as a minimum of 15 years) as a result of habitat loss, habitat degradation, and poaching. The rise in hunting reflects institutional and socio-economic factors which are not readily reversible and therefore speedy solution is unlikely. Open-country herding deer are very susceptible to inadequately managed hunting in tropical Asia. This decline is continuing, except in national parks and inaccessible areas, but increased government surveillance and lower numbers of animals has meant that loss due to hunting is decreasing. The main threat now appears to be loss of habitat (G. Dryden pers. comm. 2014).","This is essentially a tropical and subtropical grassland species (Medway 1977; Oka 1998) but is highly flexible, with successful populations in forests, mountains, shrublands and marshes (Whitehead 1993, Oka 1998, Rouys and Theuerkauf 2003, Keith and Pellow 2005). It is found from sea-level to 900 m asl (G. Semiadi pers. comm., S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Some subpopulations make seasonal movements; for example, on New Guinea numbers in the border area between West Papua and Papua New Guinea peak during the wet season, whereas in the dry season many move to the interior of Papua New Guinea (Semiadi 2006).<br/><br/>In diet it is&#160;adaptable, as indicated by its dentition and mouth shape (Dryden and Bisseling 1999),&#160;and will eat herbs, the leaves and bark of shrubs, and even seaweed (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998, Keith and Pellow 2005), although it seems to prefer certain types of grass (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998), including in its native range (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). In New Caledonia and Australia, it is a threat to native trees (de Garine-Wichatitsky <em>et al</em>. 2005, Keith and Pellow 2005). In the Torres Strait Islands, mating occurs during spring (September-October) and calves are born in autumn (April-May). In other parts of Australia, Javan Deer seems to breed at any time of the year, with a mating peak from late June to August, and a calving peak from March to April (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Indonesia it is said to breed all year around (Whitehead 1993), although a June-September increase in mating activity was found in Bali (Oka 1998), and in Java there is a peak of mating behaviour between July and September (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Where hunting or other disturbance is not a big problem, Javan Deer are primarily diurnal, gathering in large groups in open areas at night. The rut tends to involve a lot of nocturnal activity, even in undisturbed/low hunting areas (Oka 1998, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 based on observations in East Java). Javan Deer are more social than their congeners (Kitchener <em>et al. </em>1990). Herds are segregated by sex, except during the mating season, and may comprise up to 25 individuals (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 1990).","Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting long-standing high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""wildlife reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other offtake, but the national parks of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Javan Deer and, at least into the mid 1990s, very large populations) remained remarkably intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some small game, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Javan Deer and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the peoples' resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ""tragedy of the commons"", has indeed led to increased habitat destruction and poaching in the past decade. The Javan Deer, as a large deer, is particularly threatened by this rapid rise in illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008) and also by expansion of agriculture on Java and other forms of encroachment (G. Semiadi pers. comm.; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008.). In Java, this deer is poached with snares and dogs, but mostly with guns in the late 1990s and 2000s (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The Javan Deer is now seen as a source of extra income and of animal protein by many local communities despite being legally protected (Semiadi 2006) and coupled with the decentralisation of conservation management decisions and actions, macro-economic fluctuations and reduced authority of The Law, this impedes control of illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Poaching has reportedly reduced numbers at Baluran National Park, formerly the largest population within the native range, and more widely across Java, but data are insufficient to determine rate of decline (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008). Similar trends are likely on Bali. In the rest of its Indonesian range, e.g. Sulawesi, where it is introduced and thus populations are not used in assessing the Red List Category, it is also heavily hunted and there were major population declines in the late 1990s, although at least on Sulawesi the population is now in slow recovery (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Poaching of this species in its native range is for meat, medicinal products (some traded internationally), handicrafts products, and, locally, pets.<br/><br/>During the 1980s-1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Javan Deer in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree <em>Acacia nilotica</em> (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt  to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park's monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that conta<em>in litt</em>le or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the deer to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camara</em> (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Javan Deer habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).","<p>The Javan Rusa is common in much of its current range (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992, Whitehead 1993, Heinsohn 2003, Moriarty 2004). Most populations are outside the native range (Corbet and Hill 1992, Whitehead 1993, Heinsohn 2003, Moriarty 2004), including some of the most buoyant: New Caledonia (de Garine-Wichatitsky <em>et al</em>. 2004), where the population is at least 120,000 (Desvals <em>et al.</em> 1992); Mauritius where numerous at circa 60,000, and an ecological problem (R.J. Safford <em>in litt</em>. 2008); Sulawesi and the Maluku islands (Indonesia; G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008), Pulau Moyo (= Moyo island, a small island in the eastern part of Nusa Tenggara Timur, where deer are protected by local people; G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and West Papua, Indonesia (over 8,000 estimated in Wasur National Park alone, in 1992; Anon. 1994). 4000 Javan Rusas were introduced from New Caledonia in the 1990s and are said to be expanding (Maudet 1999). There are sizeable populations (5,000 to 10,000 animals) located in New South Wales, Australia, and several small (&lt;100 animals) wild herds in the coastal areas of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland (Moriarty 2004). The Rusa population was estimated to be 16,000 in 2000 (Moriarty 2004). Wild herd sizes appear to be increasing, as indicated by encroachment of Rusas into peri-urban areas in Sydney and Brisbane. A small population of Javan Rusa was introduced to the North Island of New Zealand, which is reportedly unlikely to expand (Fraser <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000).</p><p><br/></p>Conversely, populations have decreased substantially in some areas on Java, where it is a native (Semiadi 2006), including Baluran National Park which (at least in the 1990s) held the largest Javan Rusa population within its natural range. In 1996, 2,500-3,000 Javan Rusas were counted during a census when multiple teams of observers deployed simultaneously throughout deer habitat (Anonymous 1996, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Between 12 September 1998 and 18 January 1999, the population was thought to be greater than 1,000 head and it is very likely to have declined still further. Major declines have also occurred in Alas Purwo National Pak (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Even in the 1980s-mid 1990s, Bali had very few populations, probably only one of significance: in Bali Barat National Park (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). There are probably no more than ten populations in the native range (= Java and Bali) and given the size of the Baluran population, it is implausible that there could be more than 10,000 mature individuals within the native range (which would imply a census population of about 13,000-20,000) even in the mid-1990s (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">In 2014 the native population is thought to have continued to decrease except for the herds in relatively well managed <span lang=""EN-US"">protected areas such as Ujung Kulon and Meru Betiri National Parks in Java, <span lang=""EN-NZ"">(G.

It has been introduced to many other islands of the Indo-Pacific region (Corbet and Hill 1992, Heinsohn 2003, Grubb 2005,&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">Groves and Grubb 2011). Some introductions apparently took place in antiquity within present-day Indonesia, to the Lesser Sunda islands, Maluku (= Molucca) islands (including Buru and Seram), Sulawesi, and Timor. On Timor, the species inhabits both West Timor (part of Indonesia) and Timor Leste (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008, based on 1998 data). Indonesian islands with introduced populations include: Alor, Ambon, Banda, Batjan, Buru, Butung, Flores, Halmahera, Komodo, Lembeh, Lombok, Mangole, Muna, Papua, Sanana, Saparua, Seram, Sulawesi, Sumba, Sumbawa, Taliabu, Ternate, Timor, and Wetar (Wiradteti pers. comm.). Like many large deer, the Javan Rusa is an able swimmer (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990), hindering determination of its native range. The originally introduced population in Borneo is now probably extinct (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008), but in the 1990s soldiers returning from Timor brought some Javan Rusas to at least the Tanah Grgot and Penajam Paser Utara districts in East Kalimantan. Hybridization of Sambar <em>R. unicolor</em> (which occurs naturally in Borneo) with the introduced Javan Rusas has been confirmed from molecular and morphology in one captive herd (221 heads) belonging to the East Kalimantan Province's Animal Husbandry Office at Penajam Paser Utara district (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><p><span lang=""EN-NZ"">Javan Rusas were introduced to New Caledonia in the 1870s (Maudet 1999), and to Mauritius and Reunion Island in 1639. According to R.J. Safford (pers. comm. 2008) Réunion received several introductions from Mauritius; the current population is derived mainly from five batches introduced in 1954. Also seven (individual) Red Deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em> were introduced from France; the final outcome with the latter (including any hybridization with Javan Rusas which may or may not have occurred) is unknown but nowadays 'deer' are not common on Réunion, although they are still present in a few areas, and are a pest where they occur. Rodrigues holds no Javan Rusas, although there was a failed attempt to introduce them (Cheke and Hume 2008). Introductions have been made in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to New Zealand (1907, Fraser <em>et al.</em> 2000), Malaysia (1993/4), and to Brazil, Madagascar and Thailand (Maudet 1999). Javan Rusas were introduced to the Port Moresby region of Papua New Guinea from Java in 1900 (Maudet 1999) and a small population has persisted there and has spread north into the Owen Stanley Range with a herd near Wewak on the north coast; introductions to islands of the Bismarck Archipelago have either not persisted or are present in small numbers (Mammals of Papua 2009-2014). The first introductions to Australia were to Victoria (1868) and New South Wales (1890) (Maudet 1999) and wild herds of Rusas have spread to Queensland and South Australia (Moriarty 2004).</p><p><span lang=""EN-NZ""><br/></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-NZ"">Javan Rusas of Moluccan origin were introduced to West Papua in the first quarter of the 20th century; their range now includes the southern coastal plains of New Guinea from the Gulf of Papua to the Fak-Fak Peninsula, and the <span lang=""EN-US"">Doberai Peninsula<span lang=""EN-US""> and foothills of the Foja Mountains in the north <span lang=""EN-NZ"">(Mammals of Papua 2009-2014).&#160;An introduction was probably attempted onto Anjouan, in the Comoros, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but Javan Rusa is long extinct there (Louette 2004). On Madagascar, Javan Rusas were introduced near Périnet (Andasibe) around 1930, survived until at least 1955 but is now extirpated, probably having disappeared in the 1960s (Goodman and Benstead 2003: 1172-1173). The distribution map shows only native populations on Java and Bali, not introduced populations. Introduced populations are not counted as part of this assessment.</span></span></p>","The wild native population is hunted for food, medicinal products, and handicraft products.&#160;When taken from the wild, specimens are usually killed during the capture process, with the exception of some juveniles which may be kept as pets (Semiadi 2005). Commonly firearms are the weapon of choice for this type of game.<br/><br/>The species is commercially farmed in Australia, New Caledonia, Mauritius, Réunion, and Thailand (de Vos 1982, le Bel 1997) and has been farmed experimentally in Indonesia (Java) and Papua New Guinea (de Vos 1982, Tapari 1990). Farming is mainly for venison and velvet. It is also hunted for its meat (and velvet) in many parts of Indonesia, New Guinea and New Caledonia (Semiadi 2006).

22158006,41783,Axis axis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Chital is listed as Least Concern because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large subpopulations. Although it is still declining in some sites (particularly outside protected areas), at the species level any such declines are at nowhere near the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. Historical declines may have been higher, but these occurred outside of the three generation window (&lt;30 years) used for purposes of applying Red List Criteria. Listing as Least Concern recognizes that there are two significant conservation issues with this species. Firstly, current densities are mostly well below what the habitat could support (and have been for decades), and secondly, the long-term persistence of nearly all subpopulations is dependent upon well secured protected areas: anything which caused the breakdown of current effective protection would allow a rapid rise in hunting levels and perhaps of domestic stock-grazing. These are the factors with which current Chital numbers are in an uneasy and fragile relationship. If such changes were to occur across a significant part of the range, reassessment of Red List status would be required: without effective protection, Chital’s population trend would emulate that of Eld's Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em>, another herding deer of rather open forests, but with a geographic range covering areas without long-standing effective protected areas. Regular monitoring of the status of Chital subpopulations would be prudent for this species.","Chital thrive in a variety of habitats, but avoid extremes such as dense moist (evergreen) forests and open semi-desert or desert. Moist and dry deciduous forest areas, especially adjoining dry thorn scrub or grasslands, appear to be optimal, and highest densities of Chital are reported from these habitats. Short grasslands of the terai, swampy meadows and glades adjoining forest areas, coastal dry evergreen forests, mixed forests or plantations with Teak Tectona grandis and Sal Shorea robusta are also used, and indeed over much of northern and southern India, its distribution closely matches that of Sal and Teak, respectively (Raman 2013). Chital is particularly frequent in grassland–forest interface, edge, and other ecotones (Krishnan 1972). Eisenberg and Seidensticker (1976) opined that dry deciduous habitats with scrub is the favoured habitat, while Karanth and Sunquist (1992) found mixed forests with teak plantations, moist deciduous patches and swampy grasslands to support high abundance of Chital. Kumar (2010) found that well-watered and well-protected moist deciduous forest patches in gently undulating terrain supported high Chital densities. Short grasslands are important because they provide little cover for predators such as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (Moe and Wegge 1994). The introduced subpopulation in Andaman Islands inhabits evergreen forests (Sankar and Acharya 2004) but native subpopulations are absent from the rainforest areas of the mainland. They tend to be only visitors to dense forests, to those adjoining more open habitats. Riverine forests within the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal are highly used by the deer for shade and cover during the dry season. The forest also provides good foraging with regard to fallen fruit and leaves that are high in nutrients needed by the deer. Four factors were identified by Schaller (1967) as delineating Chital’s distribution: (1) the need for water; (2) the need for shade; (3) an avoidance of high, rugged terrain; and (4) a preference for grass as forage. Although several observers have noted that Chital occurs mostly in flat areas and avoids hills and slopes (Schaller 1967, Khan 1996), this may not hold in areas where preferred habitats or forage is also available on slopes (Raman 2013, Kumar 2010). It occurs in both hilly and flatter terrain, mainly the latter, in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Siwalik hills, Bhat and Rawat (1995) found that Chital preferred slopes of 11–30°, while slopes exceeding 30° were used less. Also, use of south, southeast, and east aspects was higher than of north, northeast, northwest, and west aspects, reflecting the warmer environment of the former aspects. There was no difference in average Chital density in the hills and plains (Bhat and Rawat 1995). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Chital widely, including in coffee areas up to 14 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat use varies seasonally, reflecting food availability. Chital uses more wooded habitat during the cool-dry season and early summer (November to May), where fallen fruit, leaf litter, and browse are available. In open grassland and tropical dry thorn forest, Chital density increases with the onset of monsoon rains and flush of plant growth (Mishra 1982, Moe and Wegge 1994, Khan 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). In areas of their distribution with a mosaic of forest and grassland habitats, seasonal patterns in habitat use may be complex. In the Himalayan terai, Chital use of habitats with high grass availability increased substantially in the weeks following cutting and burning of grasses in January–February, attributed to fresh flush of grass growth after the burns and with the onset pre-monsoon and monsoon rains nearly two months later (Mishra 1982; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997). Similar behaviour has been reported from the grasslands of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh 1983).<br/><br/>Chital easily habituates to human presence, and herds often congregate in open areas near habitation or forest camps to spend the night, possibly due to greater safety from predators and poachers that shy away from these areas (Raman 2013).<br/><br/>Chital eats a wide variety of plants: about 160–190 have been recorded from across the species' range. It is predominantly a grazer but consumes more fallen leaves, flowers and fruits in winter/dry season (Sankar 1994, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Raman 2013). In addition to plant soft matter, crabs (in the Sunderbans; Stanford 1951), mushrooms (in Nepal; Moe and Wegge 1994) and rarely, bark (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996) are eaten. Close to human habitation, rubbish and even human faeces are occasionally taken (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Antler and bone chewing is also common. In Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, all age and sex classes are osteophagous, but such feeding was more common in velvet-antlered males, doubtless reflecting mineral needs during antler growth and mineralisation (Barrette 1985). Chital usually drinks water once a day, more frequently in summer. This restricts them to forest tracts with assured presence of water, even if only widely scattered.<br/><br/>In lowland Nepal, an individual’s total range incorporates a core area of about 32 hectares surrounded by foraging and cover areas of about 140 ha for females and 195 ha for males (Moe and Wegge 1994). Variation in range size occurs with site, season, sex and age of the animal. The basic social unit is a matriarchal family group, normally consisting of an adult female, her offspring from the previous year, and a fawn (Ables 1974). The usual herd is composed of two or more such family units and is often accompanied by individual deer of mixed sex and age-classes. Chital exhibits a fission-fusion system, or fluid group formation and dissolution (Schaller 1967, Mishra 1982, Barette 1991). Group composition changes frequently during feeding periods, during the rut when males frequently join groups of females (Schaller 1967), and while fleeing from predators (Dinerstein 1980). These social groupings of Chital do not remain permanent (Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972). Groups may number up to 150 or more individuals (De and Spillit 1966, Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Krishnan 1972, Fuchs 1977, Karanth and Sunquist 1992), sometimes even more: N.S. Kumar (pers. comm. 2008) counted 211 in one group during rainy season in Nagarahole and 203 in one group at Pench-Maharashtra near a water reservoir in summer. Measured sex ratios have all been biased towards females (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Pariwakam (2006) observed nearly 10,500 Chital in Bandipur and estimated the proportion of Chital in different age and sex classes as stags 27%, does 57% and fawns 16%. In neighbouring Nagarahole, age-sex categories of Chital were adult stags 26%, adult does 36%, yearling males 8%, yearling females 9% and young 21% (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). Breeding can occur at any time of year but there is some peaking at any given locality (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Heavy mortality of fawns in early weeks has been observed by several workers and fawn survival appears to be a key determinant of Chital population growth (Schaller 1967). Schaller (1967) estimated an annual fawn mortality of 48% in Kanha, Sharathchandra, and Gadgil (1975) estimated a constant monthly mortality of 26% over first nine months in Bandipur, Raman (1996) estimated a mean monthly mortality of 9.7% in Guindy. Pariwakam (2006) for the first time used a rigorous photographic capture-recapture approach to estimate the fawn mortality rate, and found it to be 66% over a six week study period in Bandipur. Further information on sociality and breeding is synthesised by Sankar and Acharya (2004) and by Raman (2013). Over a 10-year time period, Karanth and Kumar (unpublished data) have observed annual fluctuations in the Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole and Bandipur ranging between population densities of 10 to 40 animals per km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Chital is a prolific breeder, as documented by several empirical studies of the speed of increase by newly introduced subpopulations or in those where a factor restraining subpopulations was removed (Raman 2013 and references therein). In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole. This and its diverse diet and habitats allow high density where threats are controlled. It is even considered to be a pest in the Andamans (Banerji 1955).<br/><br/>The main causes of death are predation, diseases and accidents. Occasionally, stags kill each other when fighting (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Predation is by far the major cause of Chital mortality. Older Chital stags are more susceptible to it than are younger stags (Johnsingh 1983, Patel 1992, Karanth and Sunquist 1995). This may be due to their being less vigilant during rut, to their separation from the group after the rut, or to weakening from injuries from conflicts. In Kanha, Chital remains were found in about 52% of Tiger faeces and 59% of Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> faeces analysed (Schaller 1967). In Bandipur, Chital is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Dhole (78%), Leopard (55%) and Tiger (19%; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even in terms of the relative number of individuals taken, Chital is the predominant prey among the three large sympatric predators (Tigers about 33%, Leopards about 39% and Dholes about 73% in Bandipur; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole remains were found in about 31% of Tiger faeces, 44% of Leopard faeces, and 50% of Dhole faeces (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Sariska, around 54% of the faeces of Tiger and 21% of Leopard faeces contained Chital remains (Sankar 1994). Chital remains were found in about 53% of Tiger faeces in Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002) and 61% of Tiger faeces in Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Each Chital spends a major portion of its life in foraging, resting, and wandering within its range, with the relative extent of these activities determined by season (Schaller 1967). In a day, peak feeding times are around dawn and dusk. There are usually two major resting periods, before dawn and mid-day (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Considerable further detail on ecology, drawn from the relative wealth of studies on the species, with each item precisely referenced to source, is provided by Raman (2013).","There are presently no major global-level threats to Chital, although densities are widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock. There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000,&#160;Madhusudan and Karanth&#160;2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.<br/><br/>The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.<br/><br/>Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (= <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Chital declined drastically throughout its range up until the first two-thirds of the 20th century (see under Major Threats). Karanth<em> et al. </em>(2010) documented an estimated average extinction rate of 45% over the last 50 years in the Indian sub-continent. It is however ""locally"" abundant in well protected parts of its range in mixes deciduous habitats. In India it occurs in 123 protected areas and forest tracts (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India in Sankar and Acharya 2004). There are some large subpopulations in Nepal (e.g. Moe and Wegge 1994) where the population is probably currently stable and is anticipated to remain so in the immediate future (Hem Sagar Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Thousands survive in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh, and there are a few introducedsub populations on coastal islands in the south (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The reported ecological densities of Chital mostly fall within three to 50 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 4.51 +/- 1.05 (SE) per&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 51.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 49.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 50.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 20.1 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.2 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 38.4 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); BRT mixed deciduous forest, 9.4 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Dandeli-Anshi mix of evergreen and deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Panna dry deciduous forest, 10.2 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Chundawat and Karanth unpublished data); Kawal dry deciduous forset two animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Siddique 2010),&#160;and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some parts of the well-protected areas in Nagarahole and Bandipur are known to harbour densities as high as 80–100 Chital per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2010). Humar (2010) observed high spatial variation in the abundance of Chital in the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Nagarahole-Bandipur National Parks, which ranged between zero to 100 animals per km<sup>2</sup>. Kumar (2010) also found that Chital densities positively responded to higher levels of protection, forage quality, flat terrain and water availability.&#160;The highest population densities, of around 200 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, are reported for the Bardia National Park, Nepal (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994) and for the reintroducedsub population in Guindy National Park, southern India (Menon 1982, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). These high densities reflect habitat and food availability in the former area (Moe and Wegge 1994), and supplementary feeding and low predation in the latter (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Population densities in marginal habitats tend to be lower (Raman 2013; K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Chital is the most abundant ungulate in Nagarahole, and reaches higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and livestock grazing (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site. This found respective densities of 65 and 10 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>The Chital is almost completely dependent on active protection. Were this to be removed, the species' status in the 1970s suggests that rapid declines would occur. Even now, a very large proportion of its range supports subpopulations at significantly lower densities than the habitat could support.<br/><br/>The only subpopulation in Europe is on the islands of Brijuni (off Istria, Croatia), but B. Krystufek (pers. comm. 2008) has traced no information on its current status. Information has not been sought for this account on introduced subpopulations elsewhere, because they do not contribute to assessing the species’ Red List status.",Unknown,"The Chital occurs over 8–30°N in India (including Sikkim), Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). The western distribution boundary is formed by eastern Rajasthan (e.g. Sariska, Ranthambore and Keoladeo Ghana) and Gujarat (e.g. Sasan Gir). The northern boundary runs along the bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan below 1,100 m asl. The eastern boundary runs through western Assam (Golapara and Kamrup district as far east as the Dhunsiri River in Darrang district) to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit (Gee 1964, Schaller 1967, Raman 2013). Chital occur throughout the rest of peninsular India sporadically in the forested areas (Sankar and Acharya 2004), but in Bangladesh, it now occurs only in the Sundarbans, having vanished from the central, northeast and southeast regions (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>Chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands (India, during 1925–1930; Banerji 1955), Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Croatia (islands of Brijuni; Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999), Moldova, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Uruguay and the USA (California, Florida, Hawaiian Islands and Texas; Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). These introduced subpopulations have not been mapped. Not all introductions have succeeded: for example, some were introduced to west-central Slovenia (from the Brijuni islands) in the late 1940s or in 1950, but this introduction failed and is now therefore frequently reported as having been of Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>. One male, shot on 12 October 1950 and now in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, proves the identification (Krystufek 1999). Managed herds occur in parks throughout the native and introduced range and in many other areas.","Chital are hunted for food, sport, and a variety of other purposes. It is unclear as to the numbers of captive animals kept within the native range and even if such animals are used to supply the same markets as wild caught animals. Introduced subpopulations almost certainly do not supply the same markets as wild caught animals from the species native range.",Terrestrial,"Chital is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It occurs in many protected areas. Legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas are the two cornerstones of its current healthy conservation status. Subpopulations exceeding 20,000 Chital probably occur in and around a handful of conservation areas within India: the belt of about 3,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;between Koh river and Haldwani including the Corbett Tiger Reserve; the Gir Protected Area (about 1,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); Kanha Tiger Reserve (about 2,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); and the Nilgiris–Western Ghats sector including Nagarahole, Bandipur, and Mudumalai (about 5,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Raman 2013). Protected areas support more Chitals than do non-protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, although there is not currently such a great difference in densities as with the grassland species (Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em>;<em>&#160;</em>Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Ongoing habitat conversion trends outside protected areas will continue to increase the relative proportion of the total Chital population that they hold, and the maintenance of an extensive network of functional protected areas will remain the foundation of this species’ healthy conservation status. Part of this responsibility is vigilance by staff and partners of illegal poaching, which takes place at varying levels in most of the species range. Some recent cases have involved high-profile public role models, such as actors, poaching Chital and these warrant heavy court penalties. There is a strong case for prevention of livestock grazing in protected areas which hold Chital, partly to reduce risks of disease transmission, but mostly to prevent artificially low densities of Chital being forced through competition (see Threat Section).<br/><br/>Chital subpopulations have been studied in: Corbett (De and Spillit 1966), Kanha (Schaller 1967), Bandipur (Johnsingh 1983, Kumar 2010), Nagarahole (Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Kumar 2010), Sariska (Sankar 1994), Gir (Khan <em>et al</em>. 1995, 1996), Guindy (Raman 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996), Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002), Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003) in India, Chitwan (Seidensticker 1976, Mishra 1982) and Karnali-Bardia (Dinerstein 1980; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997) in Nepal, and Wilpattu (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) in Sri Lanka.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22158621,10053,Hippocamelus antisensis,Vulnerable,A2cd; C2a(i),2017,2016-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Vulnerable due to a small population size and decline, reaching ≥ 30% (A2cd); suspected to have resulted from hunting and from a reduction of habitat due to destruction, and decreased quality. Given the reduction in population size (effective population size below 6,000 individuals), we also assessed criteria C. Due to the fact that all populations may be well below 1,000 individuals, we can also use criteria C2a(i) to assign a Vulnerable category.<br/><br/>Population sizes have been estimated as 750-&lt;1,000 in Chile (Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), 9,000-13,000 for Perú (Barrioand and Ferreyra 2008), between 1,900-3,000 in Argentina (Regidor <em>et al.</em> 1997, Regidor and Costilla 2003), and 5,000-6,000 in Bolivia (Nuñez 2008, Nuñez and Pacheco, unpubl. Data). Therefore, the total population estimate for the species would be between 16,650-23,000 individuals. Based on population structure data from Perú (74% adults, Barrio 2007), Bolivia (69% adults, Rumiz <em>et al.</em> 2010) and Chile (81% adults, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), we may infer that about 75% are adult individuals (11,800-15,750 adult individuals). However, it would not be wise to believe that all adult individuals are reproducing, since effective population sizes for wildlife may average 0.11 of total population size (Frankham 1995). There are no single estimate of effective population sizes for Tarukas, but there is a recent one for guanacos (Sarno <em>et al.</em> 2015). These authors indicate that the relationship between effective population size to census population size range from 0.04 to 0.99, but decreased to 0.24 when only potentially breeding adults are considered. Therefore, if we believe that effective population size is 25% on census population size, then we may be under a conservative scenario of 4,162-5,750 mature breeding Tarukas.<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is also a serious threat to the existing subpopulations, especially near human settlements (Rechberger <em>et al.</em> 2014, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011). Additionally, although there are no single monitoring programs at the regional level, there is a widely shared expert opinion of a perceived continuing decline in a large portion of the species range (Argentine, Chile and Bolivia, Barrio and Ferreyra 2008, Nuñez 2009, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), except for a few sites in Argentina, and Bolivia.<br/><br/>Given that most populations seem to be small and given that, with a few exceptions, populations may be threatened by habitat loss, and other threats, we think it is much safer to consider that Tarukas are vulnerable to extinction.","Tarukas have been found at 2,000-3,500 m asl in the southern portion of their distribution in Argentina (Cajal 1983), at 2,500-4,600 m asl in northern Chile (Contreras <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1986, Lagos, pers. Comm.), and at 3,500-5,000 m asl in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia (Jungius 1974, Merkt 1985, Yensen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994,&#160;Barrio 1998,&#160;Barrio&#160;2004). In Bolivia, this species was also found at lower altitudes (2,300 m asl) at the interandean valley named Araca (Nuñez 2008), which is covered mostly by sparse trees.<br/><br/>Tarukas live in areas with wet weather on the eastern Andes (Jungius 1974,&#160;Barrio 2004), as well as areas with dry weather on the western Andes (Merkt 1985, Contreras<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1986,&#160;Barrio 1998). Tarukas are usually found above the treeline on mountain slopes characterized by rock and cliff-like outcrops amid grassland vegetation (Jungius 1974, Merkt 1985,&#160;Merkt&#160;1987,&#160;Barrio 2004). They seem to prefer rocky areas of sparse vegetation with nearby water sources - usually a small ravine, lagoon or marsh (Merkt 1985,&#160;Barrio 2004), however, they have been observed in dense shrubbery near rivers and inside <em>Polylepis </em>sp. forests (Barrio in prep).<br/><br/>In several sections of the distribution, Taruka subpopulations live in fragmented portions of the range (Cajal 1983,&#160;Barrio 1999). The Taruka shares its habitat with domestic stock, which might compete with Taruka and decrease the area available to them (Barrio 1999, 2004).","Threats to the species include competition with domestic stock, habitat destruction, trophy hunting, and predation by domestic dogs (Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1973, Merkt pers. comm). In Bolivia, major threats are habitat destruction and illegal hunting (Nuñez 2009, Rechberger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Antlers are used in traditional medicine to cure facial paralysis (Tarifa pers. comm.) and dried meat is used by rural populations (CDC 1987). Threats in Chile include conflict with local farmers, predation by domestic dogs and displacement from their former habitat (gorges with water courses) to drier areas (Fuentes-Allende <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).","Based on data and assessments from a few localities in every country, the total population estimate would be 15,750-21,000 individuals (see the <em>Rationale</em> for data for each country). According to a conservative effective population size of 25% of total population, we may infer that the number of mature breeding adults may be between 4,162 and 5,750 individuals (&lt;60% of the threshold 10,000 individuals set for a vulnerable category for the species).",Decreasing,"The Taruka occurs as scattered subpopulations with very few contact areas among them, a distribution explained by the specialized habitat it uses. Its distribution can be regarded as almost continuous along the highlands of the Andes from the north of Peru to northeastern Chile, but we should be aware that the habitat type used is isolated in some areas, and human density is high between patches. The Taruka occurs in heavily fragmented subpopulations throughout the high Andes of Bolivia (with no records in the southwest), as well as in Chile (with three fragmented populations between Tacora volcano and Tarapacá gorge, Matta pers. Comm.) and in northwest Argentina.<br/><br/>The historical distribution was probably the same as the current one, but subpopulations might have been less fragmented. Nevertheless, historical (Mellet 1908) and archaeological records (Díaz 1995) suggest that Taruka distribution in Chile extended to Antofagasta district, approximately 590 km to the south of the current limit in this country.<br/><br/>Contrary to several publications (Geist 1998, Weber and Gonzalez 2003, Wemmer 1998), the Taruka has never occurred in Ecuador (Barrio 2013, Pinto <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). It is unlikely that the Taruka has ever crossed north of the Huancabamba depression in north Peru, even during the Pleistocene, when the habitat type it currently uses was lower than present altitude. Then, the high Andes were populated by other deer genera (Hoffstetter 1986, Wheeler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1976). The asseveration of the former presence of Taruka in Ecuador was based on doubtful records (Tirira 2001). One specimen in the Buenos Aires museum and another in the Field Museum, Chicago, were marked as coming from Ecuador (Voss 2003), but both have disappeared and could have come from anywhere else, for example Peru or Chile, if they were correctly identified. Another two specimens were deposited in the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid (Voss 2003). These were authentic records from Ecuador, as the collector, the collection site and the year were identified (Voss 2003), but both specimens were also lost and there is no way to verify the species.","The species is hunted as an agricultural pest, or for sport.&#160;Antlers are used in traditional medicine to cure facial paralysis (Tarifa pers. comm.) and dried meat is used by rural populations&#160;(J. Barrio pers. obs).",Terrestrial,"The species is included on CITES Appendix I and occurs in several protected areas across its range. Recommended conservation actions include: systematic surveys to determine status and extent of geographic distribution; support continued ecological studies of the species throughout its range; strengthen protected areas management; improve livestock management through farmer education demonstration projects. Population trends monitoring programs are needed. We suggest that at least three study sites per country should be included, considering the use of a standardized method, probably including direct observations, and spoor. At least one of the sites should be within a protected area for each country.<br/><br/>This species has been evaluated as Endangered in Bolivia (Nuñez 2009), based on a thorough survey within the country (Nuñez 2008).<br/><br/><em>Hippocamelus antisensis </em>has been declared a natural national monument (<em>Monumento Natural Nacional</em>) by Law Nº 24702 in Argentina, since 1996. This enabled the protection of taruka’s hábitat in Argentina.<br/><br/>Tarukas are considered as “Endangered” in Chile, by Law Nº 19300 and their hunting is banned by Law 19473. There is also a National Plan for their conservation since 2006 (CONAF 2006), but no actions have been developed so far and its habitat is poorly represented in protected areas (Matta pers. comm).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22165292,136551,Muntiacus vaginalis,Least Concern,,2016,2015-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Northern Red Muntjac are still widespread and common in much of South and South-east Asia, occur in many protected areas, and are resilient to habitat change and hunting. Populations in Pakistan and Bangladesh appear to be severely reduced, however. It is subject to intense trade-driven hunting in parts of its geographic range (particularly east of the Mekong) which are resulting in densities well below carrying capacity. There are thus regional variations in population trend. In Vietnam, Laos and parts of China declines probably have exceeded 30% in the last three generations (10–15 years) and on current trends can be confidently expected to do so in the next three generations in at least Laos and Vietnam and probably also Cambodia (reflecting major habitat fragmentation which compounds the effects of hunting). Future trends in China may be complex as recovery may be occurring in some areas (e.g. Hong Kong), whilst in others the population may be so small and restricted to remote and or nominally protected areas that the numbers of animals remaining to be hunted become a relatively small proportion of the total. The trend in Myanmar is clearly decreasing although the magnitude remains uncertain, but land clearance and protected area management there appears to be following a trajectory similar to that in Laos and Vietnam, albeit lagging behind by perhaps about a decade. On balance the large range in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Thailand, probably greater than 50% of the species' geographic range, and enormous total population of these countries in only shallow decline, mean that the global population is unlikely to be declining overall (past present or future) at rates sufficient to warrant listing as even Near Threatened.","The Northern Red Muntjac inhabits a wide variety of forests and scrub, including level plains and rugged mountains, dense and open forests, evergreen and deciduous areas, old-growth and secondary forests, and even grass- and cropland near woody habitats, from sea-level commonly up to about 1,500 m asl and occasionally over, perhaps with some variation regionally (Blanford 1891, Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004). Within this broad habitat use, densities doubtless vary based on conditions. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that signs, and presumably animals, were significantly more common in lower- than higher-lying areas of the Tenasserim–Dawna mountains, Thailand, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities. Population densities in Thailand are substantially higher in deciduous forest than in evergreen forest (Steinmetz and Mather 1996, Steinmetz<em> <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2010). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), <em>M. vaginalis</em> frequently exploits grass- and herb-dominated environments, linked to highly logged locations, and with a preference for lower altitudes (although they did not specify what altitude range was covered, nor discuss the possibility that because logging tends to occur in valley bottoms and lower hills rather than on steep hills and ridges, a preference for lower altitudes could simply be a consequential effect of a preference for logged areas. Teng <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Hainan, muntjacs preferred shrub grassland and thorny shrubland, used dry savanna in proportion to its availability, and avoided woods, cultivated grass-plot, and deciduous monsoon forests. Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) attributed the apparent stability in numbers of the Chinese population to logging activities, which were bringing about an increase of secondary forest and scrub dominated areas. A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Red Muntjac more widely than any other herbivorous mammal, including in coffee areas far from the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Its diet is based on fallen fruits, buds, small seeds, twigs, seed pods, tender leaves, and young grass (Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species has been cited as a major dispersal agent of fruit-producing plants in southern China (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001) and Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1977) and this is presumably so throughout its range.<br/><br/>In much of its range (although rather less than was popularly supposed until recently) this is the only muntjac species. Where congeners occur, it is widely sympatric, evidently even syntopic, with them, there is no solid evidence for competitive exclusion except perhaps at very high altitudes. Where it overlaps with Fea’s Muntjac <em>M. feae</em> in Thailand, Red clearly predominates in more deciduous habitats and lower altitudes, with Fea’s apparently more common in high altitudes and fully evergreen forest (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). It probably occurs throughout the range of Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (e.g. Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1998). There is extensive overlap with muntjacs of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex (<em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, <em>M. puhoatensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em>), but there may be areas above about 1,500 m asl where the latter greatly outnumber <em>M. vaginalis</em> and some where <em>M. vaginalis</em> is absent (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on examination of numerous camera-trap photographs from many camera-trap programmes). Camera-trap results from northern Myanmar suggest that Red Muntjac occurs largely below the altitudinal range of <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, but fully through the range of <em>M. putaoensis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004), however, reported many <em>M. vaginalis</em> at high altitudes in Arunachal Pradesh, with one direct sighting at 3,000 m asl near Tawang, and there may therefore be significant local variation in the upper altitudinal limit. Two specimens in the Natural History Museum, London from Nepal have recorded altitudes of 11,400 and 8,500 feet (3,450 and 2,590 m asl) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping in Bhutan has recorded the species relatively commonly between 2000 and 3650 m, over essentially the full elevation range surveyed, where this may be the only muntjac species present (K. Vernes, S. Dorji and R. Rajaratnam based on unpublished data pers. comm. 2014, photos seen by R.J. Timmins 2014).<br/><br/>Northern Red Muntjac appears to be able to breed all year around, although the existence of well-defined breeding seasons has been suggested for some populations, particularly in those inhabiting locations with a more seasonal climate (Barrette 1977, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001). In any case, ""peaks"" of mating activity are present, at least, in some areas (Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, Roberts 1977). Despite only a single fawn being born each occasion, overall lifetime output is high (Barrette 2004). Even where births occur throughout the year, there is still a fairly rigid cycle of antler formation and shedding, synchronised at the population level (Barrette 1977, Mishra 1982, Acharjyo and Patnaik 1984). It tends to be solitary (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Seidensticker 1976, Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Barrette 2004), reports of small groups could be attributed to mating pairs or to female/offspring units, or to temporary incidental proximity of individuals at concentrations of high-value food, e.g. fallen fruit under a tree (Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Individuals seem strongly attached to a certain home range, but there is no convincing evidence of territoriality (Barrette 1977, 2004). Northern Red Muntjac is diurnal in some areas, nocturnal in others (Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977) and is probably best regarded as crepuscular. It is an important prey for Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Tiger <em>P. tigris</em>, and Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>.","Northern Red Muntjac are hunted widely, both legally and illegally, over most of its range (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Madhusudan and Karanth 2002, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Hansel 2004, Kaul <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kumara and Singh 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008), and it is probably among the most used and most desired wild meats in South and South-east Asia (e.g. Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Patterns of threat vary across the species' range. Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas where mammal hunting has been heaviest. In its mainland China range, rates may be even higher, because a recent fire-arm ban is said to have pushed up levels of gin-trapping (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and <em>Aquilaria</em> resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 90 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing muntjacs set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per square kilometre per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Viet Namese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins in press b, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hunting intensity had in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing (Timmins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008), as of 2014 there are indications that hunting intensity has reached equivalent levels to the north, at least in some areas (Timmins in press a). In northern Thailand when muntjacs become rare, the animals are hunted in group drives, the meat is often sold (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002).<br/><br/>Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in Indochina have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Field survey encounter rates with Northern Red Muntjacs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Cambodia are remarkably low compared with other areas in its range (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In a recent reconnaissance survey of highly fragmented habitat in southern Lao PDR (Pathoumphon district, Champasak province), outside the protected area system, muntjac were the only ungulates (assumed to relate to this species on habitat and distribution) for which signs were commonly found, even wild pigs <em>Sus</em> sp(p). being noticeably more scarce (K. Khounboline and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). This pattern is general throughout Lao PDR (K. Khounboline pers. comm. 2008). However, areas of heavy hunting have lost muntjacs or had them reduced to extreme rarity, not only forest isolates such as Houay Nhang (a few square kilometres,, just outside Vientiane, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994) but also, where hunting has been extremely heavy, less fragmented landscapes (such as the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area in south Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In such areas, even though forest within them is in general heavily degraded, habitat is unlikely to be the prime cause of decline, because in some other areas of long-standing forest devastation now dominated by a mix of secondary ruderals, shrubs and grasses, muntjacs are still relatively common, e.g. <em>Phongsali</em> (far northern Lao PDR), where they can even still be heard from the provincial capital town (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005). Similarly, Red Muntjac is common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape (Chek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008), and studies in Hainan indicated selection of openings and other edge habitats rather than forest interiors (Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004), this seems generally true throughout South-east Asia (R.J. Timmins and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). There is also evidence from elsewhere in its range that this species is better able than most ungulates to withstand a certain degree of continuous harvesting as well as habitat disturbance (Jathanna <em>et al</em> 2003), although this has rarely been based on quantified status assessment. In Nagarahole National Park, India, Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) found no difference in muntjac abundance between a heavily hunted and a lightly hunted site, compared with enormous differences for most other ungulates. In the context of Indochina, even their heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, from based on visit and discussion). Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) cautioned against assuming that these results indicated an intrinsic resilience to hunting by this muntjac: it is not so readily hunted as, for example, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, because of its solitary nature, affinity for dense cover and therefore risks of getting caught are higher when using appropriate techniques to kill or capture it. However, the ubiquitous disparity in status between <em>M. vaginalis</em> and other ungulates (and indeed almost all other mammals of similar or larger body weight) in Indochina indicates that it is truly much more resilient to hunting. Muntjac populations are capable of recovering quickly from overexploitation if hunting is controlled: an overhunted, low density population freed from hunting pressure in Thailand increased 10-fold in 6 years, a rate of increase that is likely near the biological maximum attainable by the species (Steinmetz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2010). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting, muntjacs (most or all were presumably <em>M. vaginalis</em>) fell in the fifth tier, persisting much longer than all other ruminants and with only species like squirrels, civets, and linsangs being placed later in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Even so, villagers reported that muntjacs were greatly reduced in numbers in the area. The strongest demonstration of its remarkable resilience is that it is now common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels. Red Muntjac were reduced to very low populations a few decades ago, but did not become extinct, and has increased rapidly in recent years (Shek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>While wild meat is the major driver of South-east Asian muntjac trade, parts such as antlers are also heavily traded (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001).<br/><br/>Rapid economic development and expanding wealth in the species' range, particularly South-east Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. Similarly, in Thailand, trade-driven hunting has been the main cause of muntjac and other wildlife population declines, regardless of protected area status (Steinmetz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2006). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Wild meat is chosen in preference to farmed meat despite a greater price per unit weight (e.g. Hansel 2004). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em>.<br/><br/>Thus, even though this is one of the most resilient of large mammals in Indochina persisting in fragmented landscapes and often in peripheral forest areas, populations in Indochina (Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia) are likely to be declining significantly (perhaps at a level to trigger VU i.e. 30% in 10–15 years, for the regional population) (Timmins<em> <em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2008). Densities especially in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are generally well below carrying capacity, although in extensive areas of Cambodia are likely to be more natural, as they are across the range west of the Mekong (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Since 2008 rates of decline in Indochina have almost certainly increased and are now quite likely to be in the region of ‘30% in 10–15 years’, especially in Lao and Cambodia where economic growth has seen widespread landscape level changes in infrastructure and land use and concomitant rise in the value of bushmeat and in hunting pressure, although most areas in Vietnam may have already been so depleted prior to 2008 that hunting of residual animals has been relatively difficult since then, thus tempering decline rates, even though hunting intensity has probably increased (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).","This adaptable and widespread species remains locally common in most of its range (e.g. Whitehead 1993, Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lynam 2003, Johnsingh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Polet and Ling 2004, Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008), even in Hong Kong, an almost totally deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels (R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008, Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). About 20–30 individuals were estimated by Roberts (1977, based on a 1972 estimate) for Margalla National Park in northern Pakistan, this would account for most of the population surviving in that country at the time. In Bangladesh the species is the most widespread wild ungulate, more widely distributed even than wild hogs. However, the population is declining and the species is nowhere very common. It is a rare species with only a small population in the Sundarbans which constitutes half of the remaining forests of Bangladesh, but it is uncommon to rare in the remaining hill forest areas of northeast and southeast of the country (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008, Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014), this reflects “rampant...forest destruction” during the British colonial era which was, if anything, even worse after independence (Khan 2003). Hunting is the main current threat, rather than habitat loss as it is a well-adapted species. Even so, muntjacs (assumed to be this species) can still be seen readily in the north-east (P.M. Thompson pers. comm. 2008). In the southeast in the Chittagong Hill Tracts muntjacs were detected in all of 38 surveyed grid cells (each 10,000 ha and &gt;50% forest cover) during a camera-trapping survey in 2010-2011, suggesting occupancy of essentially all remaining suitable habitat patches (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). The species’ status in China is somewhat clouded by the overlap in range with<em> M. reevesi</em> (as well potentially as other muntjac species), both species have mapped ranges in eastern Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, southern Hunan and southern Jiangxi and possibly western Fujian (Zhang <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Corbet and Hill 1992). In some areas camera-trap pictures of these two species may be very difficult to tell apart (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). For instance there was much uncertainty about the identity of animals in Hong Kong with thoughts that perhaps only <em>M. reevesi </em>occured (Shek 2006), however camera-trapping surveys recently concluded that <em>M. vaginalis</em> [as <em>M. muntjak s.l.</em>] was the only species present (Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), but further investigation is warranted as although some animals do appear to be diagnosable as <em>M. vaginalis</em>, some other captive animals at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden and a photo of a female in Shek (2006) show character combinations that make firm diagnosis as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or <em>M. reevesi </em>impossible, suggesting perhaps introgression (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007) note significant differences in general pelage of muntjac in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong muntjac populations would appear to be stable and “very common”, having increased from a low point at some point in the past (Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Pei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Population status of muntjacs is presumed to be worst in the southern provinces especially Guangxi, Guangdong, but it is currently unclear whether there are differences in status between <em>M. vaginalis</em> and <em>M. reevesi</em> in these provinces. On the basis of recent surveys using multiple methods including camera-trapping (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) muntjacs (species uncertain) remain relatively widespread and appear to persist in most reasonably sized areas of suitable habitat in Guangxi, Guangdong and southern Jiangxi where hunting pressure is extremely high and populations of almost all large mammals are severely depressed or extirpated (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2014). However at a site based level muntjac in these provinces are notably scarcer than in Hong Kong, based on encounter rates of calls, faeces and camera-trap photographs, this is attributed by rural hunters to recent very heavy hunting with gin-traps precipitated by a fire-arm ban (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Status appears to be similar in Hainan, where <em>M. vaginalis</em> is currently the only known species, and hunting pressure is high (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2014), although in some well protected areas the species appears to be abundant with incredibly high densities reported (e.g. 54 animals/km²: Teng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, such high densities are clearly unnatural and suggest either methodological error or peculiar ecological circumstances).<br/>Although Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) stated that the total Chinese population of <em>M. vaginalis</em> [as <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em>] was about 500,000, the assumptions behind such a number were not explicit and it should be treated with great caution. Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) estimated that a total of 30,000 individuals were harvested each year on Hainan Island alone. <br/><br/>Populations are certainly also declining in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam, through heavy trade-driven hunting (see threats). Muntjacs in a number of Thai protected areas are increasing (Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press) so the era of widespread population decline in Thailand might have largely ended, as few are likely to remain outside of protected areas. ‘Red’ muntjacs are common in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand (Ngoprasert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), but this is within the main transition zone between Sundaic and northern taxa, so the species there is/are unknown. Populations in Nepal are thought to be relatively stable (Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). Muntjac in deciduous forests in western Thailand attain densities of 2.1–3.1 individuals/km² (Srikosamatara, 1993, Steinmetz and Mather, 1996, Sukmasuang, 2001). Densities are 2.2/km² in the deciduous forests of eastern Cambodia (Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). The following densities have been estimated in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 3.64 +/- 0.63 (SE) per km² (Jathanna <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003), Kanha moist deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 6 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 0.7 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 0.9 animals per km² (Karanth and Kumar 2005), Melghat dry deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km² (Karanth and Kumar 2005), Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, 2.5 animals per km² (Barrette 1977), Karnali-Bardia, Nepal, 1.7 animals per km² (Dinerstein 1987), and Rajaji National Park, 1 animal per km² (A.J.T. Johnsingh pers. comm. to Barrette 2004). Where studied, population densities are always well below those of herding ungulates (previous citations), but this is not so in areas where hunting has perverted ratios, where Northern Red Muntjac may even be the only deer species remaining.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Sri Lanka, most of India, northern Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and southern China, including Hainan and southern Tibet, and into southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia) south to the northern part of the Thai–Malay peninsula (Roberts 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990, Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992, Wang Ying-xiang 2002, Groves 2003, Grubb 2005). The precise southern range limit remains unclear on the Thai–Malay peninsula (see Taxonomy). It has been introduced in the Andaman Islands (Corbet and Hill 1992). It is widespread in most range states, except Pakistan (see Population).","This species is widely traded and hunted in China and Southeast Asian countries. China appears to be a major consumer and producer of&#160;<em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em>&#160;products. There is an intense commercial activity of this species from bordering Southeast Asian countries into China which involves meat, hides and medicinal products. (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Zhijun&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, see also other references in General Information section).&#160;It is not usually kept as livestock.",Terrestrial,"Northern Red Muntjac occurs in many protected areas throughout its range and in most countries is covered by laws regulating hunting at some level. Across large parts of its range, the species would benefit if these national laws involving the protection of the species were more efficiently enforced, particularly those which relate to wildlife trading. Also, greater effort should be devoted to engaging local communities in the protection and recovery of wildlife populations in nearby protected areas. The proactive involvement of communities has resulted in increased population trends of muntjac and other hunted species at various sites in the region.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However potential rates of future population decline in both core populations (see below) may approach thresholds (&gt;80%) sufficient to merit a change in status to Critically Endangered in the near future. Monitoring and collating the extent of habitat loss and loss of populations over the next 5-10 years is required.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are two numerically significant units (defined through threat profile, recent history and short-term prospects, not as populations in any demographically meaningful sense) of wild Eld’s Deer, <em>R. e. thamin</em> in Myanmar and <em>R. e. siamensis</em> of Cambodia, Lao and Viet Nam (of which the overwhelming majority of animals are in Cambodia). Numbers in India are numerically less significant for determining species-level population trends and the semi-captive herds in Hainan (now increasing) are excluded as are introduced Thai subpopulations. Since the 2008 assessment rates of habitat loss and degradation within the species’ preferred lowland deciduous forest in Indochina, which supports the majority of the wild <em>R. e. siamensis</em> population, have accelerated due to expansion of economic and social land concessions into previously remote forested areas in Cambodia’s northern and eastern plains. This is impacting both protected and non-protected forests and no Eld’s Deer subpopulations are thus effectively secure. Given this threat (and the presumed status of the Myanmar subpopulations see below) regular re-assessment of the species’ IUCN categorization is merited. In addition, the Cambodian subpopulations are small (potentially none exceeding 50 mature individuals), functionally isolated, and largely outside the core zones of protected areas. All subpopulations also remain impacted by hunting.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The status of the Myanmar subpopulations is also likely to be declining due to a combination of habitat loss and hunting. Recent (2014) evidence from Myanmar indicates considerable loss of suitable lowland deciduous forest in central Myanmar and a potentially significant decline at one of the countries two core sites (Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary) (W. McShea in litt. 2014). The Manipur subpopulation is stable but its small size (approximately 100 individuals; Hussain<em> et al. </em>2009, M.J Ranjitsinh in litt. 2014) and threatened habitat in a single small protected area leave little cause for long-term optimism.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">For the species to be categorised as Critically Endangered in the future (criteria A), an 80% decline over c. 15 years would be required, which would be likely to entail, assuming a stable Manipur subpopulation, the complete loss of Eld’s Deer populations from the remaining (one or two) sites in Lao PDR, and local extinctions from all but one protected area population in each of Cambodia and Myanmar. This scenario has not occurred, yet is possible but, perhaps, not likely. and therefore we maintain the previous assessment of Endangered. Regular monitoring of both rates of habitat loss and the status of core populations in both Cambodia and Myanmar is of critical importance for this species</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia seems to have occurred in a variety of primarily open, grass dominated habitats. Most evidence of presence comes from Deciduous Dipterocarp Forests which primarily occur in the highly monsoonal areas of the Mekong plains (Wharton 1957, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), but historical populations known from, for instance, the Nakai and Bolaven plateaux of Lao PDR appear to have used a mosaic of small grasslands and wetlands amongst pine, semi-evergreen and other forest types, and those known from the Dalat and Kirirom plateaux would seemingly have occurred in more extensive pine/savanna habitats (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species may also have occurred in northern Lao PDR, where suitable habitat is localised to a few plains amid the generally unsuitable rugged densely forested terrain but no conclusive records have been traced (Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999), and would have presumably inhabited Mixed Deciduous Forests and grasslands of anthropogenic origin, (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Populations in deciduous Dipterocarp Forest appear to favour open-canopy formations, with grass dominated understory, especially areas with extensive grassland patches, and avoid closed-canopy formations where small deciduous bamboos predominate in the understory (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Gray <em>et al. </em>2012, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Given the highly seasonal nature of such forest areas, permanent wetlands, usually in the form of forest pools or stream bed pools, are likely to be very significant to the species and the densities of animals that a given area can support (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008; T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Despite suggestions to the contrary in some sources, there is no evidence that Eld’s Deer in these countries are particularly wetland associated, nor is there evidence that the species reached high densities in floodplain tall grasslands (contrary to the case with hog deer) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The grasslands that the species appears often to associate with are favoured over forest for conversion to rice paddies, and the paddies likewise appear attractive to the deer (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Males appear to be fond of wallowing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that deer do not make substantial movements and tend to remain year round within relatively small areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). At Ang Trapaeng Thmor Conservation Area deer are forced to disperse, during the wet-season, from flooded grassland and agricultural areas around a reservoir where breeding occurs, into adjacent areas of decidious Dipterocarp Forest (S. Mahood pers. comm. 2013). Lekagul and McNeely (1988) suggested that Eld’s Deer had been driven into drier areas by hunting and habitat destruction. However, this is clearly not the case in Cambodia where historically Eld’s Deer were considered one of the most abundant species in the open seasonally very dry forests of the north and east (Wharton 1957). </p>  <p>The Loktak lake population in Manipur, India, inhabits an area of floating marsh called locally ‘phumdi’ (Singh 1983, 2004). This population has adaptations of the feet which are thought to help the animals move easily in their marshland habitat (Pocock 1943), but Pocock (1943) speculated that elsewhere in north-east India Eld’s Deer would also have occupied drier plains.&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Myanmar most Eld’s Deer occur in indaing forest, which is usually dominated by the tree <em>Dipterocarpus tuberculatus</em>, and is structurally and ecologically fairly equivalent to the Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest of Indochina and Thailand. There are two other types of deciduous forests used by the deer in Myanmar, dry (thandahat), and mixed (teak). All three forest types receive 100-200 cm of rainfall a year (Prescott 1987; Bronson 1989; McShea <em>et al. </em>1999, 2001; Myint Aung <em>et al.</em> 2001). Pristine habitat is now absent within the Myanmar range of Eld’s Deer and all populations use habitats at various stages of secondary succession (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The ecology of animals in Myanmar is likely to be similar to those in Indochina and Thailand reflecting the similarities in habitat, with dry-season movement closely correlated with the locations of water sources (Prescott 1987; McShea <em>et al. </em>1999, 2001). At the Hlawga wildlife park just outside Yangon, Myanmar, many species of Myanmar’s native wildlife have been introduced. In contrast to Hog Deer, Sambar and Northern Red Muntjac, which have all increased to good populations, Eld’s Deer has failed to establish itself within this small fenced area. This is attributed by staff, including a past veterinarian, to the area being too humid (it is said to be outside the native range of Eld’s Deer) although this has not been confirmed.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The typical habitat of ‘Eld’s Deer in Hainan Island is scrubland and dry grassland together with sparse trees in hills below 200 m asl in altitude (Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Eld’s Deer feeds on grass and some browse and also take fallen fruits and flowers, and reportedly can live without water for several days. Eld’s Deer regularly visits salt licks. Stags are generally solitary except during the rut, while hinds congregate throughout most of the year (Gee 1961, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1996). Wharton (1957) recorded large herds in Cambodia in the 1950s, and Lekagul and McNeely (1988) stated that, prior to hunting reductions, herds of over 50 formed. In Keibul Lamjao National Park, <em>R. e. eldii </em>is thought to move from the ‘phumdi’ to island hillocks during periods of flooding (Green 1990). In China, the rut is during February-June, with a single fawn born from September to January. In India, calving occurs from mid-October to the end of December. Gestation period is between 237 and 240 days, and sexual maturity is reached at approximately 1.5-2.0 years (Wemmer and Grodinsky 1988).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam the most obvious threat to Eld’s Deer is hunting, which in addition to local consumption of meat is driven by a thriving and probably increasing trade in bushmeat, a national, regional and East Asian market for traditional medicinal products derived from the species, and a regional international market for trophy antlers (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). However since 2010 large-scale habitat loss and conversion of Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest for Economic and Social Land Concessions, which also increased hunting pressure, has become an equally significant threat in Cambodia. In addition the highly fragmented nature and small population size of the remaining subpopulations makes the species’ perhaps vulnerable to small population threats.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The influence of traditional medicinal trade is uncertain, but may be very significant as products derived from the species are reportedly more valuable than are those from other deer (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). Some hunting in Cambodia is probably also driven by a demand for captive animals especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (Salter and Sayer 1986, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer, and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during forest visits, even when the visits are not for hunting (Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Predation of fawns by domestic dogs, which are ubiquitous within dry forests in lowland Indochina, has been identified as a threat to the Savannakhet subpopulation in Lao PDR (P. Vongkhamheng pers. comm. 2013) and may also impact the scattered Cambodian subpopulations particularly those outside the cores of protected areas. The effects of hunting have been exacerbated by forest loss and fragmentation, which is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. Selective logging was initially one of the main driving forces, but it is now of relatively minor concern (Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Human in-migration and subsequent agricultural encroachment into forest areas tends to concentrate on those habitats most used by Eld’s Deer, and thus the species has suffered more than most from hunting (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005). In-migration is also a commonly associated with land concessions in Cambodia. Indeed the loss of considerable (~500 km<sup>2</sup>) Eld’s Deer habitat in Preah Vihear province in 2011-12 was associated with a Social Land Concession given to military families. As an inhabitant of relatively open habitat through which travel and transport are easy, it is also likely to have been more heavily affected by a given level of hunting effort compared with species of rugged, dense hill evergreen forest; a similar scenario has been postulated for Jungle Cat <em>Felis chaus</em> (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Probably the most significant challenge to conserving the species in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam is the uncertainty involved with long-term protected-area based conservation management. No protected areas within Cambodia are safe from conversion to other land-uses. Protected areas, even those that at present have relatively active and effective management, face an uncertain future with the possibility of excision of conservation status largely for land concessions, the lack of long-term security in external funding adequate to maintain high standards of management, fluctuations in political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the consequential difficulties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Protected areas, primarily those along the tri-border area of Thailand where it adjoins both Lao PDR and Cambodia, and the Huai Kha Khaeng WS, were unable to prevent the decline and likely extirpation of Eld’s Deer from the wild in Thailand (see Bhumpakphan<em> et al. </em>2004). This decline was likely to have been driven by much the same reasons as in Indochina. If any Eld’s Deer do remain in the wild there, it seems unlikely that they will ever recover unassisted. There are few data on the introduced populations of <em>R. e. thamin</em> to non-native areas (see Bhumpakphan <em>et al. </em>2004).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Threats to the species in Myanmar appear to be similar to those in Indochina, with perhaps more emphasis on exploitation for meat (Salter and Sayer 1986, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1997). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Habitat loss in some range areas is still ongoing (Myint Aung 2004) and Koy <em>et al. </em>(2005) found that ‘patterns of percentage tree canopy-cover were negatively correlated with human population density, suggesting further threats to Eld's Deer populations as the human population continues to grow’. </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">A support programme for the main site, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, had an encouraging start but following cessation of external funding the population is now in decline (see Population), while other protected areas in the country either failed to include appropriate habitat for the species (e.g. Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park) or failed to protect the habitat even within the protected area (e.g. Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Overall, the challenges of generating functional protected areas which will sustain Eld’s Deer are similar to, and under current conditions even more daunting than, those outlined for Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (above). In general, protected areas in Myanmar are themselves highly threatened by major shortfalls in funding and political will (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2002).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The population on Hainan faces an uncertain future as a wild animal without hands-on management, because protected area management has not been effective in preventing poaching (see Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). Loss of suitable habitat has been extensive and is continuing, but large enough areas probably remain for further population expansion, provided that herds in such situations could be adequately protected from poaching (see Zeng<em> et al.</em> 2005). Genetic analyses of the population suggest that there is low diversity resulting from a population bottleneck, and this could in the future threaten the population’s viability (Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Balakrishnan <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Indian populations of Eld’s Deer declined due to some combination of hunting and habitat loss. Even at the Keibul Lamjao National Park, the habitats of the deer have been encroached for grazing, cultivation, and fish farming (Green 1990), but this seems to be mainly now under control (Singh 2004). This population is now most threatened by a hydro-electric project in Loktak Lake which maintains unnaturally high water levels during the dry season and has changed water flow patterns and water quality in the lake (Singh 2004). These in turn appear to be affecting the ecology of the Keibul Lamjao National Park floating marsh (Singh 2004, Sanjit <em>et al.</em> 2005). Floods could also seriously affect the population, which has no high ground to which it can easily escape (Singh 2004). There may also be the threat of low genetic diversity resulting from the effect of a very small founder population (Balakrishnan <em>et al</em>. 2004) and as a small isolated population it must also be considered at risk from disease transfer from domestic livestock, and potentially other factors.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Eld’s Deer readily grazes on rice and some other agricultural products (McShea and Myint Aung 2001). This provides some potential for human-wildlife conflict, but under current conditions populations seem to be too low for this to be a serious problem (e.g. at the Chonbuly district population, Savannakhet province, Lao PDR; J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Retributory killing may become more of a threat if populations are successfully rebuilt in areas close to agriculture.</p>","Based on both habitat extent and size of remaining patches, Myanmar and Cambodia are the pre-eminent countries for Eld's Deer (McShea <em>et al</em>. 2005). However, the actual status of remaining populations is more related to hunting levels.<br/><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Cambodia declines since the late 1950s, when large herds were still readily seen (Wharton 1957), have been dramatic. In the first decade of the 21st century the species declined by 90% or more, given comparisons of aerial counts in 1994 with ground survey results from 1998 to 2008 (Olivier and Woodford 1994, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Eld’s Deer may still occur over a relatively wide area, although localised within this, surviving as small remnant groups in the lowland forests of the north and east. The 2008 account suggested the total Cambodian population “could well be several thousand animals in a forest area that probably exceeds 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>”. However the current population is more likely &lt;700 individuals in a number of functionally isolated subpopulations despite remaining habitat. As a result of the scattered nature of the small Eld’s Deer subpopulations across northern and eastern Cambodia few occur within the cores of managed protected areas.&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Survey work in appropriate habitat between 1998 and 2008 detected subpopulations in at least 15 separate areas, with anecdotal evidence from several more areas (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2006, Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al.</em> in press). A few may remain in the southwest, although there is little evidence other than for one small subpopulation in the Phnom Aural area which persisted until at least the late 1990s (Henshaw<em> et al.</em> 2002, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005), but there is no more recent information. Gray <em>et al. </em>(2012) reviewed camera-trap data from eastern Cambodia between 1999 and 2007 and documented Eld’s Deer records from five of nine survey sites. However in three of these (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, areas of Seima Protected Forest and adjacent Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary and unprotected forest close to Prey Khieu at the Mondulkiri-Stung Treng provincial border) recent (post-2008) and extensive habitat loss is likely to have resulted in subpopulation extirpation.</span></p><p>Recent robust distance-based line transect surveys in a number of protected areas which support, or supported, the species (Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Seima Protection Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary) failed to detect sufficient Eld’s Deer for population estimation c.f. another globally threatened large ungulate in the landscape banteng Bos javancius (O’Kelly <em>et al. </em>2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, S. Mahood pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Only the subpopulations in Mondulkiri Protected Forest (~50-75 individuals) and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary/Preah Vihear Protected Forest (probably a similar size to that in Mondulkiri Protected Forest) are likely resident year-round within a relatively well-patrolled and secured protected area. Numbers in western Siem Pang, Stung Treng province may be higher than previously suspected (BirdLife International Cambodia 2012) but the subpopulation, of between 50-150 individuals, occurs at a site directly threatened through ongoing conversion to Economic Land Concessions. At Ang Trapaeng Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area, Banteay Meanchey province, the subpopulation of 30-50 individuals disperses out of the protected area into community forestry during the wet-season (S. Mahood pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US""><em>R. e. thamin</em> was still relatively widespread and abundant during the mid-1980s on the plains of central and northern Myanmar, where its range centred on the Irrawaddy Plain, including the Bago or Sittang Plain to the east. It was said to be present to the southeast, along the Thai border (Salter and Sayer 1986), and along the western border with Bangladesh (Lekagul and McNeely 1977), but these records are doubtful and a questionnaire in 1992 and surveys in 1997 could only find evidence for the species in the northeast (McShea<em> et al.</em> 2000). In 1992 a countrywide questionnaire was distributed by the then Wildlife Department of Myanmar, this resulted in reports of Eld’s Deer from 28 Myanmar townships, and 2,200 Eld’s Deer were estimated to remain within Myanmar, with the largest population (over 1,200 deer) in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (Myint Aung 1994, McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000). Regular transect surveys in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary between 1983 and 1996 indicated a population decline of upwards of 40% (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000), with a population estimated at about 500 deer in the latter years (Myint Aung pers. comm. 1996). More recent evidence indicates a continued decline at this site and the population is likely now to be considerably below 100 individuals (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">A nationwide survey of Myanmar in 1997 found evidence of Eld’s Deer within 23 of 24 townships surveyed, out of the 28 that were reported to contain Eld’s Deer in 1992. The four un-surveyed townships were considered very unlikely to still harbour deer because of the little remaining habitat within them (McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000). By 2003 a repeat of the 1992 surveys concluded that deer had disappeared from four townships and had declined in at least another four, but there were signs that in some townships populations were stable or even increasing (Myint Aung 2004). However, surveys in 2007 found Eld’s Deer in only 14 townships and had therefore seriously declined. Increases and decreases were in part put down to reforestation efforts and habitat loss respectively (Myint Aung 2004). More recent, anecdotal, assessment of habitat quality indicates considerable loss of lowland deciduous forest throughout central Myanmar in the last 10 years (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014). At Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, favourable habitat has been taken over by agriculture however more recent information suggests that the site may now hold the most significant Eld’s Deer population in the country with at least 200 individuals noted in 2004 (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary was described in the 2008 assessment as “now the only viable population with nominal protection, and habitat currently appears more secure” however the assessors ominously noted that “protection efforts appear to be failing, at least partly reflecting changes in management. Since funding from the Smithsonian Institution ceased in 2003, the amount of patrolling and the Eld’s Deer population have decreased every year (W. McShea pers. comm. 2008); a causal link seems inescapable”. More recent, ad-hoc, observations support this conclusion and it is likely that Eld’s Deer populations in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary have declined &gt;50% in the past 10 years.&#160;</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Two populations detected on the outskirts of Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park and Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary were&#160; never protected by inclusion in the&#160; parks, and elsewhere in the country other populations and large blocks of suitable habitat have not been gazetted into the protected area system despite hopes that they would be (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000, W. McShea pers. comm. 2008).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Lao PDR there are one or two known populations. One (of probably under 50 animals) is in Savannakhet province (central Lao PDR) and has been the focus of a community led species-specific conservation project, with regular subjective monitoring of the population (Johnson <em>et al. </em>2004, A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). However this monitoring is not able to effectively estimate population size or trends.. In the late 1990s another small subpopulation, of probably the low dozens of animals, was found from Champasak Province, far south-western Lao PDR, in areas adjacent to the Dong Khanthung Provincial Protected Area, but there has been no recent re-evaluation of the site and it is quite plausible that the species has been hunted out there (Round 1998, Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999, A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely, given the distribution of suitable habitat, the distribution of the human population, and the pervasive hunting culture in Lao PDR that any more significant populations of the species remain to be found (R.J. Timmins pers. obs.); lowland Savannakhet province was the only unprotected part of Lao PDR where in Duckworth <em>et al</em>. (1999: 41) recommended additional surveys of large mammals as likely to reveal new conservation priorities. One subpopulation was indeed found but since that was written, options for others have greatly declined due to extensive road-building, conversion of remaining dry forest habitat and assignment of much of the rest to plantation concessions (particularly on the western plains of the province) and continued extremely high levels of trade-driven large mammal hunting make the chances of any others remaining now very low (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008 from field assessment in late 2007).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Survival in Viet Nam is now very doubtful. Eld’s Deer was still reported by local inhabitants in the early 2000’s (e.g. as reported in Nguyen Xuan Dang and Nguyen Thi Thuy (2004), but field surveys of such areas have failed to find the species (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006). Perhaps a few animals remain along the border with Cambodia (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006), but repeated recent surveys of one of the more promising areas, Yok Don National Park, has not produced good evidence (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997, Eames<em> et al.</em> 2004). The reported distributions given by Dang Huy Huynh (1990) and Ratajszczak (1991) were either overly optimistic and based on unverified evidence, or indicate a recent swift decline in the species in Viet Nam; probably both factors are responsible.</p>  <p>Continued presence of ancestral wild populations in Thailand is also now very unlikely. At best a few remnant individuals may survive or immigrate. The Thai Royal Forestry Department has a captive breeding programme for both <em>R. e. thamin</em> and <em>R. e. eldii</em> and there have been attempts at introduction of the former in two areas (where it was never a native subspecies); numbers living in a ‘wild state’ are in the low tens (Naris Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Although once distributed in the tropical zone of southwest Yunnan and further east, the South China Eld’s Deer has long been extirpated (Smith and Xie 2008<span lang=""EN-US"">, Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). By the 1970s the only remaining Chinese populations were on Hainan and had declined to some 40 animals in Dong Fang and Bai Sha Counties, primarily due to poaching, from a reported 500 individuals in 1950s (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 1976 two protected areas, the Datian Nature Reserve, and the Bangxi NR, West Hainan, were founded around the two last remaining isolated herds of deer, with 26 and 20 animals respectively (Song and Zeng 2004, Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). By 1981 the Bangxi NR population had been exterminated by poaching (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). The animals in Datian NR were kept in fenced enclosures while the population grew, and at the current time the whole c. 13 km<sup>2</sup> of the reserve is enclosed (Song 1996, Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). Initial problems with conservation efforts at Datian included encroachment of almost half its habitat by agriculture since its establishment, deer deaths through drought and overcrowding in small enclosures, and some poaching (Pang <em>et al. </em>2003, Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). By 1991 the Chinese population had rebounded to 346 animals, of which 261 were within the Datian Nature Reserve (Yuan <em>et al. </em>1993). By 2003 there were about 1,000 animals in Datian NR, and beginning in 1986 captive and semi-wild populations were established at other facilities, the total population in which was approximately 260 animals in 2003 (Song and Zeng 2004, Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). A semi-wild herd was founded once again in Bangxi NR, and by 2002 the population there was reportedly 115 animals (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). In 2003 a third ‘wild’ herd was founded in Mihouling Reserve (Song and Zeng 2004, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, <em>R. e. eldii </em>was thought to be extinct in the early 1950s but was subsequently rediscovered. By 1975, the only remaining wild population had declined to about 14 animals in the swamps of Loktak Lake, Manipur (Ranjitsinh 1978). On this basis, a floating marsh on the southern end of Loktak Lake was gazetted in 1977 as the Keibul Lamjao National Park (Ranjitsinh 1978). During 2006-2008, Eld’s Deer presence was recorded in a 21.5 - 22.7 km<sup>2</sup> area of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. Higher dung density was recorded from &gt;9.0 ± 0.18&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;area of the Park. The point count method used for population monitoring revealed the estimated density of 4.04, 4.08 and 4.05 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;during 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, with a minimum of 2.97 individual per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and maximum of 6.01 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at 95% confidence level. This yields the estimated mean population size as 91, 88 and 92 individuals during 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, with a minimum of 60 and maximum of 136 Sangai at 95% confidence level. This indicates that the population of Sangai in the Park is more or less stable (Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;</span></p>",Decreasing,"This species was formerly widely distributed across suitable habitats of South and Southeast Asia, from the Manipur region of northeastern India through much of Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam to the island of Hainan (China) in the east (Salter and Sayer 1986, Grubb 2005). The historical range was broken into four major components, consisting of the Manipur region of India inhabited by <em>R. e. eldii</em>; <em>R. e. thamin</em> on the central plains of Myanmar; <em>R. e. siamensis</em> populations in the lowlands of Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (separated by the mountains along the Thai-Myanmar border from <em>R. e. thamin</em>); and the population on Hainan and former populations in mainland southern China, which appear to have been disjunct outliers of <em>R. e. siamensis</em>, separated from its main range by mountainous terrain in Lao PDR and Viet Nam.<br/><br/>The global Eld's Deer population is currently very localized to small areas within the species' former range. <em>R. e. eldii</em> is now confined to a single small population at the southern end of Loktak Lake in Manipur, India (Singh 2004). <em>R. e. thamin</em> still occurs in several localised areas of central Myanmar, as well as there being introduced populations in Thailand (McShea <em>et al</em>. 2000, Aung 2004, Naris Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. 2004). <em>R. e. siamensis</em> occurs in one or two small localised populations in Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2004), and as scattered small subpopulations mainly in the northern and eastern lowlands of Cambodia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005), and occurs in a relatively wild state in one protected area on Hainan, with additionally several other managed herds on that island (Pang <em>et al</em>. 2003).","Eld's Deer is hunted for food and other purposes. There are many captive animals, the uses of these other than for breeding stock are unknown.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. Although most Cambodian Eld’s Deer are within protected areas few occur within government approved Core Zones (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, McShea<em> et al.</em> 2005, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005, Timmins 2006). The recent loss, or substantial decline of subpopulations in, and around, Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich and Snoul Wildlife Sanctuaries, and O’Yadao Protected Forest due to conversion to land concessions largely occurred because these subpopulations were on the edge of protected areas, close to villages, and in areas where conversion to other land-uses was difficult to prevent.Conservation management of the Kulen Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protection Forest, and, particularly, Ang Trapaeng Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area and Mondulkiri Protected Forest may be stabilising and perhaps even increasing Eld’s Deer populations, through externally funded conservation management projects supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society and The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF unpublished data, WCS unpublished data, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013, S. Mahood pers. comm. 2013). However evidence of increasing Eld’s Deer populations does not exist and recent intensive line-transects surveys have not detected sufficient individuals for robust population size estimation. These five areas cover well over 3,000 km<sup>2</sup> of relatively suitable Eld’s Deer habitat, and thus the most pressing conservation need is the continued support and consolidation of these protected areas. Only once this is in place would it be sensible to divert resources to protect Eld’s Deer in further areas of Cambodia currently with little to no active protection. However the intensities of law enforcement within these sites is highly variable and dependent upon both external non-governmental financial and technical support and political buy-in from governments. For example the temporary removal of provincial police from supporting patrolling activities in Mondulkiri Protected Forest in 2011 by provincial authorities resulted in at least one documented Eld’s Deer poaching event and a considerable influx of general illegal activity across the protected area.  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">An additional conservation action within the core zone of Mondulkiri Protected Forest is the artificial deepening of natural waterholes (trapaeng in Khmer) to ensure year-round water availability, which is also planned for Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary (S. Mahood pers. comm.). Research has indicated the majority of trapaeng are dry in the height of the dry-season and trapaeng deepening has been demonstrated to maintain enhance water retention and provide dry-season water access to Eld’s Deer and other threatened species (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014 and unpublished manuscript).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The central Lao population in Chonbuly District, Savannakhet Province, is under nominal protection in a roughly 200 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;provincial protected area specifically designated for the species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004). The area had an ongoing conservation management project supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004) which since 2009 has been resumed by WWF with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The single southern Lao population found during extensive surveys in the 1990s was small and inhabited a mosaic of farmland amidst forest, adjacent to a subsequently declared provincial protected area (Round 1998). Attempts to upgrade the provincial protected area to national status have failed (A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007)..</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Thailand the protected area system failed to prevent the species' effective national extinction some years ago. Therefore, recent conservation efforts there have focused on the captive breeding of large numbers of <em>R. e. thamin</em> (see Bhumpakphan <em>et al.</em> 2004), which is not, however, native to most of Thailand. Attempts to introduce <em>R. e. thamin</em> to non-native areas have had limited success, although there is a residual herd at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station (Bhumpakphan<em> et al. </em>2004). Forty-five individuals were reintroduced into Huai Kha Khaeng WS and approximately 20 deer to Wang Lor Wildlife Sanctuary but then the programme was discontinued (W. McShea pers. comm. 2014). <em>R. e. siamensis</em> was the subject of an abortive Smithsonian Institution reintroduction program initiated in 1985. By 1989, progress was limited to construction of holding facilities at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station. As with other range states the most pressing conservation measures seem to be strengthening protected area management in those areas that cover the species' former range, so that reintroduction might be possible in the future, jointly with measures to align all stakeholders to ensure that introduction programmes do not create herds with a mix of <em>R. e. siamensis</em> and <em>R. e. thamin</em> ancestry.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Hainan population is now highly managed with most of the population in Datian NR, and other animals in Bangxi NR and Mihouling Reserve, and other captive facilities (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has been the subject of various avenues of research, for instance a population viability analysis was undertaken to examine demographic and environmental (drought) challenges to the two enclosed populations at the Hainan Datian Nature Reserve (Song 1996), with other research by Yuan <em>et al</em>. (1993) and Song (1993) (see also Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). But, the most important conservation measure needed appears to be strengthening of the protected area system so that deer can be re-established in a wild state without danger of poaching or habitat encroachment (see Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">India held 97 captive animals in 15 zoos in December 1992, a slight decline from over 100 in the mid-1980s (Decoux 1993); by 1994, 14 zoos held 107 animals (Sharma 1994). The population is probably inbred: all reportedly are descended from two founder pairs (Walker and Marimuthu 1991, see also Balakrishnan <em>et al. </em>2003). The 40&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;Keibul Lamjao National Park was gazetted in 1977 specifically to protect <em>R. e. eldii</em> (Ranjitsinh 1978). Subsequently projects at the park have raised public awareness, and local support has been developed for conserving the endemic Manipur subspecies, and largely halted encroachment of the species habitat (Singh 2004). Status surveys of <em>R. e. eldii </em>have been carried out annually in Keibul Lamjao National Park since 1975 (Ranjitsinh 1996, Singh 2004), and research has been undertaken by Singh (1983, 2004). A Wildlife Institute of India proposal in the 1980s to establish a second free-ranging population in Assam (Khan <em>et al.</em> 1993) was not implemented. Conservation needs are essentially mitigating detrimental effects of the hydropower project on the park, strengthening the protected area management of the park (e.g. through even further improvement of local relations and capacity building), increasing the park’s area to meet the needs of deer through appropriate research and potentially establishing further wild populations in other areas.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Myanmar, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary were established specifically to protect <em>R. e. thamin</em> (Salter and Sayer 1986), but little management has been undertaken and despite promising initial efforts, management effectiveness appears to be decreasing (Myint Aung 1990, W.J. McShea pers. comm. 2008). Deer were found on the outskirts of two other protected areas&#160; Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park and Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary, but protection efforts were never extended to cover the appropriate area, and the majority of the remnant area occupied by the species are likely to be outside protected areas (McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000, W. McShea pers. comm. 2008). A number of reintroductions have taken place into enclosed sites such as Hlawga Wildlife Park, using animals from Rangoon Zoo and the wild. In 1995, an ecological study of radio-collared <em>R. e. thamin</em> was initiated in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary by the Smithsonian Institution, and a community education project commenced later that year to raise local awareness of the deer and the wildlife sanctuary (Wemmer 1995). The Wildlife Division surveys the population annually using a basic line transect method. Conservation measures needed were recently assessed to include extending the protected areas network (McShea<em> et al.</em> 2000) but in the interim the most pressing needs seem to be to prevent further deterioration at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and to salvage the Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, if this is possible.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">McShea <em>et al.</em> (2005) argued that ""only Cambodia, with 11% suitable forest protected, has placed sufficient dry dipterocarp forest under protected status. Other Southeast Asia countries have not recognized dry dipterocarp forest as a significant ecotype worthy of conservation status"". It is certainly true that this forest type has been seen as a low priority in the conservation planning of all range states, but consideration that a country has placed 'sufficient' of any habitat type under protected status is subjective and a variety of measures can be used. In this case, 'sufficiency' was judged on the basis of proportion of a country's total suitable habitat that has been nominally protected. An alternative would be to consider factors like the actual amount of protected habitat, and whether this is enough to represent the range of biotic variation within the country; whether such habitat is in large enough blocks to remain ecologically functional into the long term, and whether protection is largely nominal or is genuinely effective. The last dichotomy is likely to be the chief determinant of whether Eld's deer will survive. Considering that no range states yet have existing protected areas which have secured the species on a long-term footing (although there are promising developments in several countries), and considering the speed with which populations can decrease, priority is necessary at present to concentrate most conservation actions for Eld’s Deer on securing existing protected areas for key populations which have real potential for success. This has become increasingly urgent given the accelerating threats to lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest in Cambodia both outside, and within, protected areas. Determining this potential will reflect situational factors as much or more than ‘traditional’ biological factors such as current Eld’s Deer status within them. Eld’s Deer could potentially persist in habitat mosaics of forest and agriculture, as they still do in some areas of Myanmar and Cambodia (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000, T. D. Evans pers. comm. 2007), but cultural predisposition to hunting and competing land uses make it unlikely that poaching can be controlled, or habitat management developed, without the context of a protected area, in most range countries (India and perhaps Myanmar being the most likely exceptions).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are large captive populations of the species, estimated in 2003 to number 180 <em>R. e. eldii</em>, 1,100 <em>R. e. thamin</em>, 23 <em>R. e. siamensis</em> (non-Hainan stock) and 280 <em>R. e. siamensis</em> (Hainan stock), but most captive groups are not managed with conservation in mind (Siriaroonrat 2004). There is some scope for using these animals in reintroduction programmes, particularly in Thailand where Eld’s Deer is nationally extinct yet the country is now probably in ‘the best financial and administrative position’ of all range states to conserve landscape-scale field populations of the species (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22167140,29742,Rangifer tarandus,Vulnerable,A2a,2016,2015-12-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In 2015, <em>Rangifer </em>tarandus is categorized as Vulnerable A2a due to an observed 40% decline over three generations (about 21-27 years) across the circum-Arctic countries, when <em>Rangifer </em>declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410 individuals. Uncertainty is high about the extent of the decline and the under-lying mechanisms except at a general level. Extent and causes of the decline vary with region and subspecies. Causes of declines include habitat changes, which do not appear reversible within three generations. <br/><br/>The species is largely migratory and gregarious and is thus susceptible to declines as a result of landscape changes, including the establishment of barriers (related to human activities and infrastructure development), which can disrupt migration routes and destroy seasonal habitat. Unregulated hunting, time lags in management and habitat alteration leading to habitat loss, fragmentation, and changes in predation are mechanisms for declines. Furthermore a warming climate will have complex and interacting effects and concerns are strong about a warmer climate exacerbating effects of disease and parasites including the possibility of epidemics. Additionally, despite monitoring, uncertainty remains about abundance and trends as well as trends in habitat loss which suggests the observed declines in <em>Rangifer </em>abundance and habitat may continue over a further three generations.","<em>Rangifer </em>occupy a number of habitats from continental coastal plains to mountain ranges and Arctic islands, spanning high Arctic to Boreal forest. The Arctic island tundra habitats include high Arctic polar desert to semi-moist dwarf shrub tundra. The low-lying coastal plains on continental North America and Russia vary from narrow coastal strips of tundra to large low-lying extent of tussock and non-tussock graminoid tundra. The tree line transition zone also varies in width depending on elevation and climate and separates the tundra from the Boreal forests. In mountainous regions, elevation determines the level of the tree line and the transition between coniferous forest and montane tundra. Along the rugged southwestern coast of Greenland, the tundra is a relatively narrow vegetated band separated by deep fiords or glaciers reaching the coast. <br/><br/><em>Rangifer </em>is a generalist herbivore with a diet dominated by lichens, forbs, sedges, grasses and shrubs. Foraging is seasonally selective and focused on individual plant species and selecting flower buds and unfolding leaves to maximize nutritional value (Russell <em>et al.</em> 1993). Winter diet is often largely lichens, which may occur as thick mats in many boreal coniferous forests. <em>Rangifer </em>is unusual among large-bodied herbivores as it can exploit lichens which, although high in digestible carbohydrates, are low in protein (Russell <em>et al.</em> 1993). Lichens are slow-growing and are periodically unavailable for decades after fires sweep through the forests. Caribou tend to avoid burnt areas preferring the forests 150 to 250 years after fires (Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1998). <br/><br/><strong>Life History</strong><br/>Adult survival is typically high (80-90%), while calf survival is annually variable. The annual life-cycle starts with the cows being bred in the fall rut (September-October) and then calving in June after a gestation averaging 225–235 days (Bergerud 1975). The cow’s autumn body condition determines the age of first pregnancy and the annual likelihood that a cow will conceive. Barren-ground Caribou usually calve at 3 years of age and usually calve annually but reproductive pauses occur if a cow has not regained sufficient fat and protein reserves by the rut and thus does not conceive (Cameron 1994, Thomas and Kiliaan 1998). The climate across <em>Rangifer </em>distribution is highly seasonal, is characterized by a short snow-free plant growing season and a long winter when snow often adds to the energetic costs of moving and foraging. Climate is strongly regional and trends in climate differ across the regions (Whitfield and Russell 2005). Correspondingly, <em>Rangifer </em>have a strongly seasonal cycle of accumulating fat and protein reserves which are high prior to the rut and lowest during calving (females) and after the rut (males).<br/><br/>Caribou are relatively long-lived, with females living as long as 12–16 years, and males for a few years less (Thomas and Killiaan 1998). Single births are usual (Thomas and Killiaan 1998). The calf is able to stand within a few minutes of birth and in two to three days can keep pace with the maternal cow. Generation time, used in species assessments, is estimated at 8-9 years based on barren-ground Caribou adult survival and fecundity.<br/><br/><strong>Breeding Strategy</strong><br/>The sexes differ in body size, breeding pelage and antler size. <em>Rangifer </em>is polygynous (a male mates with more than one female) and the breeding system is thought to be a harem system. Cows have several oestrus cycles of 10-12 days (Ropstad 2000) and conceptions are highly synchronous within a herd during the four- to five-week mating season (Dauphiné and McClure 1974). Less information is recorded about the rut strategies of the forest-dwelling <em>Rangifer </em>(caribou and valentinae). Female reproductive strategies are relatively flexible with the cows trading off their survival against reproductive investment during conception, foetal growth (birth mass) or lactation. The strategy is an adaption to annual variations in energetic costs and the availability of forage. <br/><br/><strong>Movement Patterns</strong> <br/><em>Rangifer </em>characteristically is a constant migrant, the migrations from winter to calving and post-calving ranges and then from fall to winter ranges are a striking global phenomena. Migratory behavior is associated with gregariousness. Although the highly gregarious nature of the tundra herds is conspicuous, forest Reindeer is also gregarious although the numbers are less. In Finland, forest Reindeer during calving are dispersed but the Reindeer is gregarious during the rut and into winter (Miettunen 2014).<br/><br/>Abundance influences the scale of seasonal movements: when abundance is high, migration distances can be long (thousands of kms) from wintering deep in the boreal forests to calving and summering on the tundra. For some herds, calving and summer range is an Arctic island and the winter range is the neighboring continental mainland (Poole <em>et al.</em> 2010, Baskin 2005). Geographic fidelity to calving and summer ranges tends to be high both in migratory tundra Caribou and forest Reindeer (Pulliainen <em>et al.</em> 1986). When abundance is low, fall and winter ranges most often contract toward the calving and summer ranges and the length of the migration pathways is correspondingly reduced, often by hundreds of kilometres. On the arctic islands, when abundance is low, Caribou are dispersed in individual home ranges, as abundance increases, seasonal migrations increase in distance and the degree of gregariousness (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Mountain Caribou rely on migrating between lowland winter ranges to high elevation calving and summer ranges on the alpine tundra. Forest (and woodland Caribou) Reindeer are dispersed at low densities and undertake relatively small-scale seasonal migrations with selecting calving areas in boggy areas on small islands in lakes. In Greenland with its narrow coastal strip of ice-free land that is dominated by fiords and mountains, movement is restricted and generally oriented on an east-west axis.","For mountain and forest <em>Rangifer</em>, landscape changes from forestry and industrial developments especially roads and seismic lines lead to changes in vegetation and vulnerability to predation (Leblond <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Johnson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). However, despite knowing the relationship between landscape changes and predation, management is not yet effective, as declines of boreal Caribou have continued (COSEWIC 2014, Johnson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Landscape changes, especially transportation infrastructures, energy production plants and tourist resorts, often represent barriers for migrations, and are responsible for Reindeer population fragmentation in Norway (Panzacchi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a,b; 2015). Some landscape changes, include mining about which concerns are locally strong, include dust and cumulative effects. Less is known about population versus individual responses to industrial development. An exception is the Central Arctic Herd in Alaska. The western part of the calving ground has been intensively developed as oilfields with networks of roads, pipelines and drill pads. Calf body mass and survival was affected by this development (Arthur and Del Vecchio 2009), but initially the herd increased partly as a result of a trade-off between development costs in better regulated hunting.<br/><br/>Unregulated hunting and competition with domesticated Reindeer are documented threats for continental tundra Reindeer (Baskin 2005). However, mechanisms underlying widespread declines are incompletely understood, especially the role of predation, nutrition, disease and parasite interactions. <em>Rangifer </em>have been harvested for thousands of years and harvest is a part of the life and culture of northern aboriginal people. But, technology has changed hunting effort which is often uncoupled from <em>Rangifer </em>abundance leading to delays in detecting effects of unsustainable hunting. The conditions when, and if, harvesting becomes a threat are complex and although <em>Rangifer </em>is subject to management planning, the realities are that management responses are frequently hampered by mistrust of scientific data, disagreements about causes of declines, and time lags in institutional responses to implement management actions (Kolpaschikov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>Climate change is rapid in the Arctic and its effects will be complex as relative and absolute forage availability changes, the timing of snow melt, ice freeze-up and break-up changes. A detrimental effect that can change the context of other threats is changes in the frequency of rain-on-snow or other icing events (Hansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, 2014) especially on the Arctic islands. Icing events can cause widespread changes in movements and deaths especially of calves and adult bulls. A warmer climate will have complex effects on parasites (Kutz <em>et al.</em> 2014) as some are adapted to a cool climate and their development may be reduced in warmer temperatures (Hoar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Warmer temperatures will change the distribution of intermediate hosts and vectors such as mosquitoes. In Finland, recent warmer summers increased mosquito activity leading to outbreaks of Setaria in Finnish Reindeer, causing many deaths (Laaksonen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).","Overall across the circum-arctic countries, the trend is an inferred 40% decline over the previous 10-25 years, when <em>Rangifer </em>declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410. There are national, but no global, databases to assess conservation status, although the Circum-Arctic Rangifer Assessment Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) network tracks trends in migratory tundra <em>Rangifer</em>. For this IUCN assessment, we used data from journal publications, web sites, published and unpublished reports and expert knowledge. We did not use in-filling methods to bring estimates to the same reporting period as survey methodologies varied from expert opinion to ground and aerial survey-based estimates. Consequently, abundance estimates have variable measurement error (as described by, for example Baskin 2005, Cuyler 2007, Bjerketvedt <em>et al.</em> 2014). Estimates of abundance vary as to whether adults only are reported. Estimating population size is often infrequent which influences describing trends over 3 generations (21-27 years) and we were occasionally limited to assessing trend over 10 years. Generation time is estimated at 7-9 years based on barren-ground Caribou adult survival and fecundity as input to the IUCN generation length calculation which uses mean survival values (generation length = (1/mortality rate) + age at first reproduction). For subpopulations with adult survival data, a similar range of values is calculated. However, calculation of generation time is complicated (Hernandez-Suarez 2011), as it depends on the population age structure and average age.<br/><br/>As well as the 40% overall decline during the past 10-30 years, the abundance of wild Reindeer and Caribou has declined since historic times (Bergerud 1974, Syroechkovski 2000, Festa-Bianchet <em>et al.</em> 2011) especially for forest and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. In Russia, in the late 1800s, there may have been 5 million Caribou which rapidly declined to about 600,000 by about 1900 and 250,000 by the 1960s before recovering to peak in the 1990s (T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). For the continental tundra <em>Rangifer</em>, any question of historic declines is complicated by the longer-term (decadal) cycles in abundance (Meldgaard 1986, Zalatan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Joly <em>et al.</em> 2011). Generally, many continental tundra herds peaked in the 1990s then declined. The current declines are less than historic minimums for several Canadian continental tundra populations despite management actions such as hunting restrictions. In Norway, abundance has recovered since hunting caused historic declines until hunting was halted in 1902-06. However, it is uncertain if the current declines are less or similar to the historic levels. <br/><br/>Typically, declining abundance and distribution can fragment populations. However, trends in numbers of <em>Rangifer </em>populations are complicated as their definitions are not standardized. While populations (herds) are relatively easily recognized from calving and post-calving to rut movements for continental tundra and mountain Caribou, terminology is more problematic for forest Reindeer and boreal Caribou. Additionally, fragmentation and introductions have altered population numbers so any relationship between overall declines and numbers of populations is unclear. Three examples reveal the complexity. Firstly, in Norway, the two or three large historic sub-populations of mountain reindeer historically declined by the early 1900s and recovered but into a landscape increasingly fragmented by roads, railways, energy production plants and tourist resorts. The developments blocked ancient migration routes (Panzacchi <em>et al.</em> 2013a) and the former two or three populations became fragmented. <br/><br/>The second example of complexity in interpretation for trends in populations is on Canada’s island of Newfoundland, 12 natural populations were the basis for an additional 20 introduced populations (COSEWIC 2014). The third example, is in Alaska, during peak numbers, two small mountain herds ‘disappeared’ when a larger and increasing neighboring herd expanded their range and overlapped the smaller herd’s range (Harper 2013). The larger migratory tundra populations mostly persist for decades, even as their abundances increases and decreases (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/><strong>Alaska</strong>: Overall, the total number in 27 herds for coastal tundra and mountain Caribou (Harper 2013) have declined about 40% in abundance from approximately 1.1 million Caribou at the peak of herd sizes (1994±2.3SE) to 660,000 (2010±0.03SE). Currently, most (20) herds are 2,500 Caribou or less while the other 7 herds are 30,000 or more. Six of the smaller herds may have increased but uncertainty remains about the earlier estimates, three of the larger mountain herds have increased (with predator and hunting management) while three of four coastal tundra herds are declining. Most monitoring is annual for survival and productivity and frequent estimates of herd size for the larger herds. <br/><br/><strong>Canada</strong>: Overall, Caribou have declined in abundance over three generations by an average of 52% to the current (2015) estimated 1.3 million Caribou. The decline is unevenly distributed among the different types of Caribou. Monitoring boreal Caribou is mostly dependent on monitoring mortality and productivity while population abundance is directly estimated for mountain and migratory tundra caribou from sample counts during calving, post-calving or fall. However, the frequency of monitoring varies considerably. <br/><br/>Boreal Caribou have continued to decline since 2002 despite conservation efforts to mitigate the cumulative impacts of oil and gas development, forestry, and other land use activities. For 37 of 52 boreal subpopulations where trend data are available, 81% are in decline. Population surveys prior to 2002 estimated that there are 33,000 forest-dwelling caribou in the boreal population and in 2014, an ongoing decline of &gt;30% of the boreal Caribou is inferred. <br/><br/>Caribou on the island of Newfoundland declined by 68% since 2002 for the 15 natural and 22 introduced local populations. A remnant of the former southern extent of Caribou in Canada’s southeast, the Gaspésie Caribou declined further since 1950 to about 120 adults despite being in a national park and predator removal. <br/><br/>Overall for mountain Caribou, status is uncertain as trend is measured for 18 of 45 sub-populations over the last 5 years representing approximately 54% of the current population, 9 are declining and only two are increasing. Of concern is that 26 herds are &lt;500 individuals, 13 are &lt;250 and two have disappeared (COSEWIC 2014). <br/><br/>On Canada’s arctic islands, the overall trend for Peary Caribou, <em>R. t. pearyi</em>, is a decline to about 14,000 individuals by 2014 from 22,000 estimated in 1987. Historically, Peary Caribou abundance was higher being an estimated 25,845 for the High Arctic Islands in 1961 and about 18,000 for the mid-arctic islands in 1973-1980 but infrequent monitoring impedes assessing total numbers (COSEWIC 2004, SARC 2012). Peary Caribou occur as 4 populations (island groupings) one of which has essentially disappeared since the 1980s, one has declined and stabilized at low numbers while the north-western island grouping has been through two sharp declines followed by recovery. The trend for the northeastern and southeastern populations is uncertain given a low frequency of abundance estimates. An additional type of Caribou is Dolphin and Union (<em>R.t. groenlandicus </em>x<em> pearyi</em>) on the large mid-arctic island of Victoria. The population has not recovered to the abundance recorded in the early 1900s. Currently the population is stable or declining at 27,000 between 1997 and 2007 (SARC 2013, Dumond and Lee 2013). <br/><br/>Sixty percent of Canadian Caribou are barren-ground Caribou which in 2013, numbered an estimated 729,000 individuals in possibly 11 subpopulations. Six populations are regularly monitored. Since the peak in the mid-1990s, the overall decline has been approximately 45-50%, with six subpopulations having declined by 70-98% from peak populations in the mid-1990s. Caribou on Baffin Island declined from over 100,000 to about 5,000 and for the Bathurst herd in the central Arctic Canada, the decline was from 460,000 in 1986 to about 20,000 in 2015 with the decline accelerating in the later stages (SARC 2013, CBC 2015) Two of the largest herds of migratory Caribou are the woodland Caribou sub-species although they are strongly migratory with aggregated calving. The George River declined from a peak abundance of 776,000 in 1993 to 14,200 in 2014 while the Leaf River peaked at 638,000 in 2001 and had declined 32% to 430,000 by 2011 (S. Coté pers. comm. 2014) <br/><br/><strong>Greenland</strong>: <br/>The overall trend for Caribou on Greenland’s west coast for 2004-2015 is an approximate 30% decline and, conservatively, the total number of Caribou in 2015 is about 73,430 excluding three populations with feral Reindeer mixed with the Caribou (Cuyler 2004, 2015). Caribou abundance is cyclic with two cycles since 1721 with short-lived peak abundance, rapid decline and extended periods of scarcity that may last a century or more before numbers recover (Cuyler <em>et al.</em> 2011). The most recent peak may have occurred in the late 1990s but changes in census techniques obscure trends (Cuyler <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cuyler unpublished). Possible causes of the previous abrupt declines include severe weather involving the entire coast in combination with overgrazed ranges, and possibly, hunting (C. Cuyler pers. comm.). Although only the four largest populations are monitored for abundance through aerial surveys, all 11 sub-populations have annual harvest monitoring (Cuyler 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Norway</strong>: There are approximately 6,000 wild Reindeer in four populations restricted to the mountains of southern Norway (Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012, O. Strand pers. comm.). Their numbers over three generations are relatively stable based on 3 of the 4 populations which are regularly monitored through minimum counts. Also in the mountains of Norway are another 8 populations which were previously mixed with semi-domesticated reindeer and 11 populations which originated from releases of semi-domesticated reindeer (Reimers 2007, Røed 2005, Røed <em>et al.</em> 2014). The behavior and reproduction performance of the reindeer is influenced by the semi-domesticated reindeer (Reimers <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2014). Overall, the trend for all 23 populations is increasing to stable under a regulated hunting regime. In 2002, the estimated total number for all populations was 22,000-29,000 and in 2015, 33,560-34,360 (O. Strand pers. comm., Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, the populations that have been mixed with semi-domesticated reindeer and which originated from the release of semi-domesticated reindeer have not been included in the calculations of population size (nationally or globally) for this re-assessment.<br/><br/>Svalbard Reindeer <em>R. t. platyrynchus</em> numbered 10,100 individuals in 2009 (Sysselmannen på Svalbard 2009), an increase since the early 1900s. The Reindeer were hunted for 100s of years but the introduction of firearms and commercial hunting in the 1860s led to reduced numbers and local extinctions. Hunting was halted in 1925. The extent that current abundance and distribution have returned to historic levels is not reported. Recent trends are available for three of the 13 populations (Adventdalen, Reindalen ,Brøggerhalvøya) as their distribution is restricted by glaciers to peninsulas and coastal lowlands. The trend is a 65% increase in the three populations from 1,217 in 1985 to 1,871 in 2012. A fourth herd, Edgeøya (northeastern Svalbard) was last counted in 2006 (Reimers 2012) and was considered stable or decreasing (Aanes <em>et al.</em> 2003, Reimers 2012). <br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Finland</strong>: Forest Reindeer are remnant of their former numbers and distribution as the Reindeer disappeared from across central and southern Finland in the early 1900s, but re-colonized from neighboring Russia in the 1940s (http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en). Numbers increased from 1992-2001 when 1,700 forest Reindeer were counted in Kainuu, eastern Finland but subsequently declined to 800 individuals by 2014. A second Finnish population started in 1984, when 10 forest Reindeer from Kainuu were released at Suomenselkä, central Finland and increased to about 1,100 in 2014 (Miettunen 2015). The decline in Kainuu’s wild forest Reindeer since 2001 seems to have been caused by higher calf mortality from increasing numbers of wolves (Kojola <em>et al.</em> 2004), traffic accidents and movements into Russia. <br/><br/><strong>Russia</strong>: Overall, abundance in Russia has declined 21% since 1990 compared to 2015 and the recorded abundance declined from 1,050,600 to 831,500 (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). The situation is quite different from North America as there are high numbers of domesticated Reindeer. The effect of domesticated Reindeer includes increased predator control as well as poaching and loss of the domesticated Reindeer to the wild Reindeer herds (Baskin 2005, Klokov 2004, Syroechkovski 2000).<br/><br/>Historically, wild Reindeer decreased since the mid-1800s to the early 1900s from as many as 5 million to less than 1 million. Abundance fluctuated during the 20th century with a peak in the early 1990s, then abundance declined. The declines in Reindeer number were mainly connected with social and economic changes in Russia. Regional status is variable and 23 populations or regions are listed in regional red books between 2001 and 2015 as being reduced to low numbers or declining (I. Mizin pers. comm. 2015). <br/><br/>Russia has a high diversity of wild Reindeer sub-species and recent declines are especially apparent for island, forest and mountain Reindeer. One population (Nizhny Novgorod) has disappeared and 19 populations are ranked as Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Currently forest and mountain Reindeer in the Russian Plains (Karelia, Arkhangelsk, Komi and Nenets Autonomous District) are all listed in the Red Books and have declined 64% in 1991-2015 from 35,400 to 12,800 individuals while their distribution is highly fragmented and reduced.<br/><br/>The sub-species <em>R. tarandus pearsoni</em> restricted to Novaya Zemlya Island has declined 30% to 5,000 individuals but Reindeer on the other Arctic islands have declined at a higher rate (73%) from 41,000 to 11,000 individuals between 1991 and 2015 (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). In eastern Russia, <em>R. tarandus phylarchus</em> in the forests on the Kamchatka Peninsula have declined since the 1950s (Mosolov 1996) and more recently, declined about 50% from 4,500 to 2,300 (1991-2015). In the Russian Far East and Pacific coast, mountain-tundra Reindeer are stable in trend but with a risk of fragmentation into small isolated populations. In southeastern Russia, <em>R. tarandus angustirostris</em> (transbaikal slender-snouted Reindeer) is a forest Reindeer and difficult to survey, but apparently reduced to several hundred animals. <br/><br/>The most numerous sub-species are the migratory tundra Reindeer (<em>R. t. sibiricus</em>) currently numbering 626,000 individuals (North Yukutia, Yamal, and Taimyr ) which have declined. The western Siberian tundra Reindeer (Yamal) have declined from 3,000 to 2,000 between 1991 and 2015 on ranges impacted by industrial development (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). Uboni <em>et al.</em> (2015) report that Taimyr and North Yakutia (Yana-Indirka, and Sundrun) tundra Reindeer had peaked in the 1990s and then subsequently had declined 25% to 624,000 individuals, while the Lena-Olenek herd increased from 55,000 in 1985 to 90,000 in 2001. The population is heavily harvested at about 9,500-12,000 individuals per year (T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). With the collapse of the domesticated reindeer industry in Chukotka in the 1980s and 1990s, the wild Reindeer in Chukotka increased rapidly from 33,000 in 1991 to 93,700 by 2015 (Klokov 2004, I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015)<br/><br/><strong>Mongolia</strong>: Trends in abundance are unreported (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006) for <em>R. t. valentinae</em> in northern Mongolia. The limited assessments indicate fewer than 1,000 wild reindeer (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Decreasing,"<em>Rangifer </em>is widespread occurring between 50 and 81 degrees of latitude around the Arctic in the northwestern U.S., Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Finland, Russia and Mongolia. The global distribution was expanded by introducing domesticated Reindeer which became feral to Iceland, and to islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean (Kerguelen, Falkland and until recently, South Georgia Island). Greenland, Finland, Mongolia, Norway and Russia also have domesticated Reindeer which have genetically and or demographically contributed to wild Reindeer populations (Røed 2005, Røed  <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, C. Cuyler pers. comm. 2015). Those populations which include domesticated Reindeer are not included in this assessment. <br/><br/>The geographic range has contracted and become fragmented during the previous hundred years mostly due to hunting and landscape changes with increased settlement, agriculture, forestry and the introduction of Reindeer herding. Analyses of current and historic distribution are available at national scales for some countries. By the early 1900s, forest Reindeer had disappeared from Finland (<a href=""http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en"">http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en</a>) although in the 1950s, a small area was re-colonized from neighbouring Russia. In Norway, the cumulative ranges have contracted to about half the size of the historic range (Lund 2004). Russian Reindeer distribution has contracted to the north and west and become fragmented over 85% its range (Syroechkovski 2000).<br/><br/>The Canadian geographic ranges of mountain and Boreal Caribou have contracted: over the last 150 years, Boreal Caribou have been extirpated from about half of their former range: approximately 60% in Alberta, 50% in Ontario, and 40% in British Columbia (Hummel and Ray 2008, COSEWIC 2014). In eastern Canada, the current Atlantic-Gaspésie population is the remnant of a larger distribution that included much of northeastern Canada and USA but which disappeared by the early 1900s (COSEWIC 2014). For mountain Caribou in BC, by 2002, 40% of their annual range had shrunk (COSEWIC 2014).<br/><br/>Less information has been compiled regarding changes in the current historic distribution for continental tundra Caribou, and is complicated by the 40-60 year cycles of abundance with contractions and expansions of distribution. Historic declines in Alaska of the Fortymile herd between the 1920s and 1970s, led to a contraction of range size of 25%. The risk is that contraction of the historic range is relatively poorly documented and consequently the current distribution is considered ‘normal’, this could be considered an example of a shifting baseline (Pauly 1995).",Local meat consumption and hide use; some commercial use antlers.,Terrestrial,"Most <em>Rangifer </em>herds are within management or conservation plans, and the conservation status of most subspecies and populations are nationally assessed. The ratings for conservation status (nationally rated as endangered, threatened or special concern) based on designated units (Canada) or oblasts (regions in Russia) emphasize the vulnerability of woodland and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. Only 4% of continental tundra <em>Rangifer </em>and 12% of Arctic Island are included in conservation categories compared to 84% of mountain and forest Caribou. In Russia, wild Reindeer are assessed and listed by conservation status in regional Red Books. The national Committee On the Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) has assessed or re-assessed almost all Caribou for their conservation status using similar criteria as the IUCN’s (COSEWIC 2014). The assessments lead to either recovery or special management planning which includes identification and protection of critical habitat. <br/><br/>Unlike many migratory species, <em>Rangifer </em>is not a recognized species within the Convention of Migratory Species probably because few migrations cross international boundaries. Two <em>Rangifer </em>populations annually range over international boundaries between Canada and the US (Selkirk Mountain Caribou and the Porcupine herd) and international cooperation is through agreements. In Finland, forest Reindeer are listed as Near Threatened under Appendix III (Protected fauna species) of the 1979 Bern Convention (The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). The forest Reindeer in Finland seasonally move across the border with Russia and the degree of monitoring and cooperation is high (Miettunen 2015). In Norway, the 23 populations of Reindeer were collectively assessed as Least Concern in 2015 (<a href=""http://data.artsdatabanken.no/Rodliste"">http://data.artsdatabanken.no/Rodliste</a>). The US assigns Threatened status to the Selkirk Mountain Caribou although the herd is reduced to a few individuals.<br/><br/>Management systems are summarized in Klein (2005) and typically, their emphasis is on tracking population trends and vital rates and adjusting hunting for migratory tundra and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. Although many herds are monitored, lags in management actions lead to accelerated declines especially where hunting effort through technological advances is uncoupled from trends in abundance (Kolpaschikov <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bjerketvedt <em>et al.</em> 2014, Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Russia, socio-political factors have a greater effect than decadal climate patterns in shaping trends in abundance (Uboni <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Norway where the Reindeer ranges are increasingly modified, landscape management is becoming more important than reliance on harvest management (Kaltenborn <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Landscape management includes special use and protected areas and experience with their effectiveness varies. Despite progress, conservation planning has not reversed or even stemmed the landscape causes of declines (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2015). In some areas, hunting restrictions, population augmentation and predator management have taken precedence in areas where industrial land use changes continued unabated and this can lead to controversy (Brook <em>et al.</em> 2015). Protected areas such as national parks are not a complete answer to <em>Rangifer </em>conservation if they are accompanied by increasing tourism and recreational activities.<br/><br/><em>Rangifer </em>includes some of the globe’s largest and longest migrations with tens of thousands animals moving 100s of kilometres. Thus the effectiveness of protected areas in conservation will depend on planning a network of protection for annual ranges (Runge <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, current protected areas are at the scale of seasonal ranges rather than a network of land management or adequate protected areas to integrate conservation of seasonal ranges (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2014). Emphasis for migratory tundra caribou has been on protecting calving grounds as in Canada where three national parks provide year-round protection for part of the calving grounds of five herds. In Russia, the Taimyrski zapovednik established a nature reserve in 1979 which covers about 6% of the Taimyr herd’s calving areas.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Thus, the species is assumed to still be in decline by at least 10% over 24 years (three generations) mostly due to habitat conversion and degradation.<br/><br/>The range is now severely fragmented and the total area of occupancy (AOO) possibly falls below 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, if areas of unsuitable habitat within protected areas supporting it are excluded. If the AOO were to be confirmed, then this species may also qualify as Vulnerable based on criterion B2. However, no substantive new information was received in 2014 to enable a full reassessment of this species.&#160;This species is reliant upon hands-on management in protected areas and changes in management style could see a resumption of very rapid declines echoing those of the mid-twentieth century.","Habitat use differs between Barasingha populations, and is reflected in hoof morphology. Central Indian animals (<em>R. d. branderi</em>) occupy open sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>) forest with a grass understorey and grass glades; northern animals (<em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em>) are obligate grassland forms, true Swamp Deer, inhabiting flooded tall grassland (Dunbar Brander 1927, Pocock 1943, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), and, in Bangladesh, formerly, around mangroves of the Sundarbans (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Barasingha is predominantly a grazer (the main forage species are given in Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004), but at least <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> is known to feed occasionally on aquatic plants (C.D. Schaaf pers. comm. 1990), and aquatic plants contribute significantly to the diet of <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> during the monsoon and winter (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>The animals disperse in the wet season and congregate in large herds during the dry season, often in response to new growth following fire and the need for drinking water (Henshaw 1991, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004 and references therein). These seasonal movements take animals outside protected areas in at least Dudhwa and Kaziranga (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Dudhwa, mean group sizes during summer, monsoon and winter were 32, 13 and seven respectively; congregations of up to 250 individuals have been seen (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994). The composite home range of herds ranges from 10 to 30 km<sup>2</sup> annually (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>The Barasingha is polygynous: males and females have a linear hierarchy and during the rut males tend to defend females in oestrous (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1985, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Mating in <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. branderi</em> occurs during winter; most of the stags are in hard antler by September and they start calling by then. Calling peaks during mid October to November, but occurs within mid August–mid April. As the season progresses, the evening calling peak shifts to morning (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Rutting starts for <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> in August–September, for <em>R. d. branderi</em> in early December and for <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> in April; antler shedding begins by mid January, late April and early October respectively for the three races; fawning peaks in July–August, September-October, and March-April respectively for the three races (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2005 and references therein). There is strong fidelity to rutting sites and animals continue to visit those amid cultivation (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>The Barasingha is monoestrous and monotochus (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Females reproduce at the age of two to three years and males older than four years contribute to breeding (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Gestation lasts 240–250 days (Asdell 1964). The sex ratio in all three subspecies ranged from 40–80 stags per 100 hinds (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Sankaran 1989, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). The low male to female ratio reflects selective predation and poaching (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Barasingha females, including the two-year-olds, have reproductive rates of 20–45 fawns per 100 hinds (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Sankaran 1989, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Barasingha mortality is largely by predation, flooding (for <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. ranjitsinhii</em>) and poaching. Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> is a major predator of Barasingha, there are reports of kills by Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> and Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em> (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Golden Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em> predation on fawns and yearlings was reported by Singh (1985) and Schaff (1978).<br/><br/>Ecology and behaviour have been studied in several populations; Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004) gives an overview of information to date.","It is likely that Barasingha always had a patchy distribution, reflecting the available suitable habitat, and thus was predisposed to local extermination (Groves 1982). In aggregate, habitat conversion has led to its loss from most of its ancestral range. High levels of malaria discouraged settlement, agriculture and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape until recently. The conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India] and the [human] population is growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile terai plains have been taken over by agriculture."" (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004: 32). Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary (203 km<sup>2</sup>) is one of the few remnants of terai habitat in India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). This deer's habitat is now reduced to isolated fragments as a result of agricultural encroachment and the destruction through habitat conversion of wetlands; the wet grasslands were seen as useless areas (they were termed ‘blanks’). Conversion took place largely during the 1930s–1960s (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Isolation into small, fragmented, populations increases the likelihood of localised extinctions, including those through chance events such as extreme weather and disease, as well as compounding the effects of ‘situation-normal’ threats like hunting.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation is still problematic within protected areas supporting Barasingha. Grass, timber and fuelwood cutting by local people degrade the surviving habitat, which lies mostly within protected areas, and external threats include change in river dynamics due to human developmental activities, increase in siltation and reduced flow of water during critical periods of summer. Protected area management practices are sometimes questionable, e.g. the current practice of grassland burning to control woody succession needs to be done in form of a mosaic, and harrowing should be discouraged as it seems to deteriorate grassland condition and promote occupation by unpalatable grass species like <em>Cymbopogon</em> spp. Many grasslands and woodlands have weed infestation (e.g. <em>Sesbania</em> spp.); manual weed removal in Dudhwa and Kaziranga yielded good results for habitat of Barasingha (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2004). Although there seems to be no direct analysis of the effect of domestic stock grazing on this deer, in other wild ungulate communities studied in India they cause a major depression of densities of grazing species (e.g. Madhusudan 2004), and pending direct data, this should be assumed to be the case with Barasingha. Barasingha populations recovered in parts of North and Central India once grazing by domestic stock was controlled (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Serious efforts remain necessary to control grazing in Hastinapur, Jhilmil tal and Katerniaghat (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The grasslands and wetlands of the Terai arc landscape and the obligate species that they support, even those within protected areas are besieged by a multitude of threats which synergistically bode badly for the future (see also Red List accounts for Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Great Indian Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>).<br/><br/>Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Chital <em>A. axis</em> (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.). Particularly in Bangladesh, hunting seems to have been responsible for national extinction because the Sundarbans mangrove forest is still extensive (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It is likely to remain a highly significant threat for populations outside well-secured protected areas.","The present distribution of the Barasingha is much reduced and fragmented, reflecting major losses in the 1930s–1960s through conversion of large tracts of grassland to cropland and through barely-restrained hunting (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/><br/>The northern subspecies <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> is the most numerous of the three races, with an estimated wild population is of 1,800–2,400 in India and 1,650–1,800 in Nepal (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004; Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, NTNC, <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) reported <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> from 15 localities in India of which 11 were in Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, three in Assam and one in West Bengal. At present <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> exists in only six localities in Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, two in Assam and none in West Bengal. In Nepal, out of four localities reported by Schaller (1967) only two now hold the species. Holloway (1973) reported a locality additional to Schaller’s, the Katerniaghat Sanctuary in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh. According to Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004), using data largely from Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995), <em>R. d. duvacelii</em> is restricted to Jhilmil tal Wildlife Conservation Reserve (Uttaranchal; no estimate), Hastinapur Sanctuary; Bijnor Forest Divison; Pilibhit Forest Divison (50–90 animals in the early 1990s, about 50 a decade later, centred on the Lagga Bagga forest block of Mahof and Mala ranges; Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; but a population of about 300 in Lagga Bagga reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Kishanpur Sanctuary (about 400 in the early 1990s, Qureshi and Sawarkar 1994; and still “considerable numbers” a decade later, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; a population of 600 reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Dudhwa National Park, Kheri District (a decline from 1,200–1,500 in 1976 to about 700 by 1993, but still excellent habitat; Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; a population of 600 reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Katerniaghat Sanctuary (10–25 animals in the early 1990s) (all in Uttar Pradesh) in India. There is also a population of over 100 Barasinghas in a small conservation reserve called Tatwala in Hardwar district; this habitat and population is totally isolated from other Barasingha populations (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). A small population was discovered in Uttarakhand state in 2005 in Jhilmil Jheel, an (37 km<sup>2</sup>) area of Reserve Forest.&#160;It persists at two sites in Nepal, Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and Karnali–Bardia Reserve. At the former there was an increase from around 900 in 1976 to around 1,850 animals in 1993 (Henshaw 1993), and since then relative stability: the minimum estimate in a count in April 2007 was of 1,674 animals, making this the largest single population in the world of the subspecies (Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, NTNC, <em>in litt</em>. 2008). In 2014, the Swamp Deer population was estimated at 2,301 (H. Baral pers. comm., based on data from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation). At Karnali–Bardia Reserve, at least 34 animals were thought to be present, an increase from six in 1977, by Bauer (1990); during 1995–1996, Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral (<em>in litt</em>. 2008) recorded about 73 animals in the park. Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated 50–100 animals. Since the assessments of Schaller (1967) populations have apparently gone from Banke Division and Chitawan Division (both Nepal); Jaulasal Sanctuary; Lalkua Sanctuary; Maldhan Sanctuary; along the river Ganges, west of Handpur; between Hardwar and Luksor; Sonaripur Sanctuary; South Kheri Forest Division; Bahdi Tal, six miles west of Bellerain; Ghola and surrounding tracts; Mirchia, bordering Nepal; Jaldapara Sanctuary and surroundings (all India) (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further details of the Indian population of <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em>, estimated to total 3,500–4,000, are summarized in Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995); no more recent synthesis was traced.<br/><br/><em>Rucervus duvaucelii ranjitsinhi</em> is only found in Assam: Kaziranga National Park may have held about 750 animals in 1984, but this had declined to 350–500 by 1994 (Choudhury 1987; Qureshi and Sawarkar 1994). These numbers were not based on methods which quantify confidence in the proposed population size; the first-ever rigorous estimates came from Karanth and Nichols (2000) who recorded a population density of 14 animals per km<sup>2</sup> during their surveys in 1996 in Kaziranga National Park. The current status in Manas Tiger Reserve is uncertain (although it reportedly still occurs; B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and the species is extinct in Darang Division along the Bhutan border (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em><em>&#160;branderi</em> survives only in Kanha Tiger Reseve (Madhya Pradesh): the population peaked at an estimated 500 in 1988, an increase from a count of 66 in 1966 (Khajuria and Sinha 1986, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 1995, Karanth and Nichols (2000) estimated population density of three per km<sup>2</sup> in Kanha National Park. In 2004, the population was thought to number 300–350 (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Other populations had become extinct since the 1960s in Motinala and Karanjia ranges, Mandla District; Balaghat District between Baihar and Lamba; near Amarkantak, Bilaspur District; near Kota, Bilaspur District; Madhya Pradesh-Orissa border Raipur District; West Bastar Division near Tekemeta; West Bastar Division near Kutru in Toynar and Bhairamgarh Range (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004; some different locality names were used in Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>In 1992 there were approximately 50 individuals in five Indian zoos and 300 in various zoos in North America and Europe (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004)",Decreasing,"The Barasingha is currently found in isolated localities in north and central India, and southwestern Nepal. It is extinct in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Into the early twentieth century, the Barasingha was widely distributed in areas of suitable habitat throughout the Indo–Gangetic plain and the lowlands flanking the southern Himalaya. The range formerly extended eastward across the terai of southern Nepal through the Sundarbans as far as Assam. Barasingha occurred west to the River Indus, into Pakistan, and as far south as the River Godavari area of east-central India (Schaller 1967, Groves 1982, Sankaran 1989). The only known population in Bangladesh was in the Sundarbans, where it has been extinct for perhaps a century. The species may also have been in the northeast of Bangladesh, given its distribution in adjacent India (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Groves (1982) defined three subspecies with distributions (from Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004) as follows:<br/><ul><li><em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> (G. Cuvier, 1823) (Wetland Barasingha): Indo-Gangetic plain, north of the Ganges: Nepal, India, and, where extinct, Pakistan.</li><li><em>R. d. branderi</em> Pocock, 1943 (Hard-ground Barasingha): central India, between the rivers Ganges and Godavari.</li><li><em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> (Groves, 1982) (Eastern Barasingha): Brahmaputra plain; probably disjunct from the nominate for a very long time (Groves 1982): India and, where extinct, Bangladesh.</li></ul>","Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer&#160;<em>Axis porcinus</em>&#160;and Chital&#160;<em>A. axis</em>&#160;(Qureshi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed on CITES – Appendix I<em></em>. It is a Schedule I species under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004) and it is protected under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Swamp Deer is one of 27 mammal species strictly protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (1973) of Nepal. A PHVA (Population and Habitat Viability Assessment) workshop was conducted at the Wildlife Institute of India in July 1995. In 1995 there were 74 (25:34:15) individuals of <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> in 10 Indian zoos (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). <br/><br/>Protected areas form the cornerstone of protecting Barasingha, given its attachment to level, well-watered areas, i.e. those perfect for agriculture. This makes for challenging conservation: “Controlling human disturbance on Lagga Bagga [Pilhibit Forest Division, Terai Arc Landscape, India] is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder. Intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area” (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Lagga Bagga was recently accorded protected area status, as a tiger reserve (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Lagga Bagga and Kishanpur protected areas are connected by the Pilibhit Forest Division although Barasingha habitat is not contiguous (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Dudhwa is also close by, and Lagga Bagga is adjacent to Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve of Nepal. These four areas in total hold most of the remaining <em>R. d. duvauvcelii</em>. Not surprisingly, few Barasingha herds now exist outside protected areas; in the Terai Arc Landscape of northern India, Hog Deer and Barasingha had the highest proportions (of all ungulates studied) of their regional populations within protected areas (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Remaining populations outside protected areas seem to be small, scattered, and facing a number of threats difficult to resolve; probably these should be seen as of lower priority than ensuring the persistence of populations within protected areas, but a rigorous assessment of this is needed.<br/><br/>Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995) recommended conservation actions which can, over a decade later, be boiled down to maintaining the integrity of the protected areas supporting key populations, with particular attention to:<br/><ol><li>Curb poaching. The species does not have a high international trade value so poaching must tackled at least partly by and through local communities.</li><li>Curb habitat degradation through further fragmentation and over-harvest of plant material from protected habitat.</li><li>Develop long-term conservation management security for those areas where significant numbers disperse seasonally out of existing protected areas into surrounding farmland.</li><li>Maintain appropriate burning regimes and other active habitat-management measures.</li><li>Reduce and eventually cease grazing of domestic stock within protected areas.</li></ol>All these five issues should be addressed through effectively formulated and implemented protected area-specific management plans, reflecting the fragmented present distribution, the negligible likelihood of ever rejoining populations and that the threats have local causes and thus locally appropriate solutions. Given the wide range of possible threats and, in particular, the apparent necessity for active management of habitats (as well as control of human behaviour), management plans are particularly important to ensure a cohesive approach to conservation of Barasingha within the ecosystem of each protected area. Management plans have been prepared for various protected areas but their current status is not documented here.<br/><br/>One of the subspecies is down to a single herd, and another to just two herds. This makes extinction for a variety of unpredictable factors (e.g. weather, disease) a possibility. Establishment of additional populations of each of these forms a priority (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Patches of suitable habitat remain for each form, from which the species has been hunted out and which could, if hunting can be prevented, serve as suitable release areas. Captive breeding is often mentioned as being important for this species, but its conservation benefit is not clear. Each subspecies has protected areas which have–in the nick of time for two subspecies–secured buoyant populations. To expand beyond these, those protected areas retaining the species but not functioning so effectively need strengthening to allow natural recruitment. Establishment of additional herds of the two races down to a single site could be supported by translocations from each one’s sole current herd.<br/><br/>There are ongoing plans in Nepal to translocate some of the deer from Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve to boost the smaller population of Bardia National Park. The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation is also looking at the feasibility of re-introducing the species to Chitwan National Park. Swamp Deer was extirpated from Chitwan National Park during the 1960s, possibly due to a combination of factors (e.g. poaching, disease and habitat loss). The re-introduction programme will follow IUCN guidelines and ensure that in case of a catastrophic event in Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, good numbers are also stocked in other protected areas where the species occurred in the recent past or still occurrs in small numbers.<br/><br/>In Kanha National Park, conservation activities have included dispersal of Tigers <em>Panthera tigris</em> away from main grazing areas, control of poaching, cessation of grass burning, creation of water reservoirs, and reduction in domestic cattle numbers (Khajuria and Sinha 1986). Out-migration of villages from the park has significantly extended Barasingha habitat and protected their traditional fawning and rutting grounds (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994).

The Mindoro subspecies also frequents open grasslands, where it may be able to persist (<span lang=""EN-US"">although it requires the presence of a minimum of forest patches). In general, however, this is a forest species, which forages in grassland.","The species is threatened due to continuing and severe loss of habitat due to illegal logging, human encroachment, agricultural encroachment and mining (Villamor 1991). It is intensively hunted throughout its range for meat, hides, trophies, and trade, and legal protective measures are often not enforced (Villamor 1991). Some subpopulations or subspecies are now severely threatened. Removal of animals from the wild for commercial purposes and the establishment of deer farms near protected areas (consisting of this species and introduced/foreign species) are a potential threat through the spread of disease and hybridization. Because of its small population size, the Mindoro subspecies (<em>R. m. barandana</em>) is highly threatened, due to the same causes (with intense habitat loss, as over 90% of forest cover has gone on the island)<span lang=""EN-US"">; poaching from lowlander Tagalog Mindorenos and hunting pressure from indigenous people might have become the main threat to this subspecies (E. Schutz pers. comm 2014).","Populations of this species are fragmented, but are reported to be locally common in isolated areas, but heavily hunted and declining throughout most of its range (Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1994). The largest populations are located on Luzon, Mindanao, Samar, and Leyte (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991). Local extinctions have been reported on Biliran (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1991, Rickart <em>et al</em>. 1993), and probably Bohol and Marinduque (W. Oliver pers. comm.). Population declines have been reported in the subspecies <em>R. m. barandana</em>, which has the most restricted range on Mindoro, and which island has been severely deforested, especially in lowland areas (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991).

A large herd mixed with domestic stock is maintained on a ranch in Batangas, medium-sized deer farms (30–40 animals) exist in the Bicol region, and small backyard farms (3–5 animals) are found on Luzon. However, it is most unlikely that these initiatives might ever mitigate threats to any wild populations, as originally supposed, partly because of the increased demand for wild-caught founder breeding stocks, but also (and perhaps more importantly) it is virtually inconceivable that the commensurate establishment of legal markets in locally produced venison would not be widely abused for the continued sale of illegally-caught specimens; especially given the ineffective enforcement of existing protective legislation pertaining to these and other commercially valuable species.<br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions include:<br/><ul><li>Conduct surveys of Philippine deer populations on all major islands to determine their relative abundance, and the nature and extent of threats, and efficacy of any existing protective measures.</li><li>(Re-)investigate the systematic relationships of these animals from and within all major islands, especially within the ‘Greater Mindanao Faunal Region’, and secure comparative specimens from currently undescribed populations on Samar, Leyte and other smaller islands.</li><li>Identify most ‘at risk’ populations based on the aforementioned surveys and systematic studies, and formulate and implement consensual recommendations for the enhanced future protection (and/or recovery) of the most threatened populations/taxa; any such recommendations to also include: the development of new ‘protected areas’ (and/or enhanced protection and management of existing protected areas) where existing habitat and species’ protection measures are clearly inadequate at present; and the re-evaluation and amendment of the evident existing anomalies between permissible subsistence hunting of non-threatened species by indigenous people <em>versus</em> contrary and more recent amendments to the threatened status rankings of traditionally targeted species/subspecies, and/or genuine subsistence hunting <em>versus</em> recreational (and/or commercial) hunting by local community hunters who are no longer economically dependent on such resources.&#160;</li><li>Conduct a field investigation of species in an undisturbed population, preferably within a protected area.</li><li>Re-examine the whole precepts of local deer farming initiatives in the Philippines, and the extent to which they help or hinder conservation.</li></ul>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Area of occupancy and habitat quality are also thought to be declining, and the species faces a number of serious ongoing threats including bycatch, habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, and competition from introduced species.","A riparian species, it is found in holes primarily along oxbow lakes, less frequently by rivers and ponds. It does not inhabit all water bodies within its range; it has quite strict habitat requirements and prefers water bodies with rich water-marsh vegetation, bushes and primary forests along the banks. Prefers lakes with 1-2 m depth with rich invertebrate fauna. Also found in small rivers with slow flow. In favourable years it is able to reproduce during the whole year, but usually has two reproduction peaks at the end of spring and autumn. Males participate in care of young. Omnivorous, recorded feeding on at least 72 species of water invertebrates and 30 plant species, as well as fish and amphibians.","The main threat to the Russian Desman at present is the widespread use of fixed fishing nets. These nets, which are used by poachers, have become increasingly cheap and widely available in recent years: one study recorded 50 'outlets' freely selling these nets on the Moscow-Vladimir section of the Nizhny Novgorod highway alone (<a href=""http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html"">http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html</a>). The very low price and high durability of modern nets means that poachers often leave them in the water for days or even months, checking them only occasionally and often abandoning them. A Desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. <br/><br/>The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm Desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the Desman depends upon.  <br/><br/>A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian Desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced Nutria (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>) and Muskrats (<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>) may also be a threat.","At the beginning of the 1970s in the Soviet Union there were about 70,000 individuals, of which the majority occurred in Russia, with about 1,500 individuals in Kazakhstan and single records in Ukraine and Belarus.

Total population across the species’ range is estimated at over 500,000 animals; if 30% to 50% of animals are mature (based on maturity rates in other zebra species) this gives a population of 150,000 to 250,000 mature individuals. However there has been a population reduction of 24% since 2002, and a 25% decline since 1992 (about 2.5 generations, as generation length is about 10 years). Total numbers were estimated at about 660,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002), roughly the same as they were in 1992 (671,000 animals; Duncan and Gakahu 1992). It is very likely that 3 generations ago (in 1985) that the population was similar in size, so it is a fair assumption that the population reduction has occurred within the last 3 generations. Although it is problematic to compare survey data conducted across time, there is no reason to think that error has changed drastically as the methods used remain roughly the same. Should the population reduction increase at the time of the next assessment it is possible that the species will qualify as VU under Criterion A.<br/><br/>There has been a population reduction in 10 out of the 17 range states since the 1992 and 2002 IUCN Red List assessments. In many countries Plains Zebra are only found in protected areas, with little or no individuals outside them. Lack of surveys outside protected areas makes assessing trends and population sizes difficult across most of the species’ range, but for a species that is considered common and widespread the observed decline is worrying.","Plains Zebra live in all habitats in Africa from sea level to 4,300 m on Mount Kenya, with the exception of rain forests, deserts, dune forests, and Cape Sclerophyllous vegetation (Duncan 1992).<br/><br/>Plains Zebra live in family groups of a stallion with mares and their juvenile offspring. While each of these groups have a home range, the groups join together and move as herds in some or all parts of the year (Klingel 1969, Rubenstein 2010). The home range of Plains Zebras varies across the continent, being determined by seasonal vegetation changes and habitat quality (Smuts 1975). In East Africa, home ranges in Ngorongoro were 80-250 km² in different parts of the crater (Klingel 1969), whereas they were larger in the Serengeti: 3-400 km² in the wet season and 4-600 km² in the dry season (Klingel 1969). Combined with a migration route of 100 to 150 km in each direction, Serengeti zebras cover at least 1000 km² in a year. This can be compared with annual home ranges of 49-566 km² in Kruger National Park (Smuts 1975). In some areas the herds form discrete subpopulations, separated by natural barriers or marginal habitats (Smuts 1974). These subpopulations cover areas from 28-136 km² in Zululand (Brooks 1982) to 1530-1560 km² in Kruger National Park (Smuts 1974). In areas where resources are scarce or patchily distributed, zebras daily cover a lot of ground. In the dry season zebras moved up to 34.5 km to forage in Botswana (Brooks and Harris 2008), whereas in Ngorongoro they moved about 6 km (Klingel 1969); in Kruger National Park they tended to move less than 2 km in a day across the year (Owen-Smith 2013). Studies of zebras have shown how their spatial awareness allows them to orient movements towards preferred forage patches or the nearest water source, and thus move efficiently across large distances (Brooks and Harris 2008).<br/><br/>A central feature of Plains Zebra ecology is their migration, tracking resource abundance across the seasons (Young <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). One of the biggest ungulate migrations in the world occurs in the Serengeti. At a large scale zebras follow the long grass that grows after the rains (Bell 1971), at a finer scale they move to maximize intake of food of sufficient quality, while minimizing time spent in habitats where they may encounter predators (Hopcraft <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Not all zebra herds migrate (e.g., Stelfox <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1986, Georgiadis <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003), with different herds reacting differently to changing conditions (Owen-Smith 2013): in the Okavango Delta of Botswana only about 55% of zebras make the 588 km round trip (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Migration allows zebras to optimize their nutrition by moving to prime grasslands during the wet season (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), selecting higher quality resources rather than absolute abundance of grass (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). The start and pace of migration is controlled by the environment: it is initiated by cumulative precipitation, with daily movement being a function of precipitation rate and NDVI (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Zebras have the flexibility to alter their migration patterns to avoid adverse conditions or to find new resources (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). As fences constrain many populations (Shem <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this allows them to re-establish migrations once barriers are removed (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Plains Zebras tend to be found in mid-productive grasslands in areas where there is the highest green standing crop (McNaughton 1985), selecting areas of the highest grass biomass regardless of quality (Groom and Harris 2010). Across studies Plains Zebras were found in open savanna with an abundance of grass and the presence of some trees or open woodland. The Plains Zebra diet consists almost entirely of grasses (Bodenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000), with occasional browse to maintain protein levels (Berry and Louw 1982). Compared to ruminants, zebras are generalist and bulk feeders, spending more time foraging (Seydack <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Owen-Smith and Goodall 2014), and having a diet that is of lower quality (McNaughton 1985, Ben-Shahar 1991) and higher fiber (30-36% of dry matter, Macandza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) than sympatric bovids of a similar size.","The quagga was driven to extinction in the late 19th century by overhunting and competition with livestock.<br/><br/>While equid meat is often not a preferred choice, Plains Zebra are threatened by hunting through much of their range, especially when they move out of protected areas. Hunting for their skins occurs, particularly in East Africa as these subspecies do not have the shadow stripe present in southern African subspecies (Foley <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Fencing areas can block migration corridors (Foley <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014), although Plains Zebras have been shown to re-establish migration routes if barriers are removed, even if they are blocked for over 30 years (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011).","Plains Zebra are considered common and widespread across Africa, but there has been a population decline in 10 out of the 17 range states since the 1992 and 2002 IUCN Red List assessments. In many countries Plains Zebra are only found in protected areas, with little or no individuals outside them. Lack of surveys outside protected areas makes assessing trends and population sizes difficult across most of the species’ range. <br/><br/>Total population across the species’ range is estimated at over 500,000 animals; if 30% to 50% of animals are mature (based on maturity rates in other zebra species) this gives a population of 150,000 to 250,000 mature individuals.

This represents a population reduction of 24% since 2002, and a 25% decline since 1992 (about 2.5 generations, as generation length is about 10 years). It is very likely that 3 generations ago (in 1985) that the population was similar in size to numbers given in 1992, so it is a fair assumption that the population reduction has occurred within the last 3 generations. The exact number of Plains Zebra is unknown due to different survey methods applied across their range, and many areas having no recent survey data. This makes comparison of survey data problematic. In the country specific data below confidence intervals or other range descriptors are given when available, but most accounts do not provide this information. However when comparing data over the past few generations any error in calculating total population size is likely to have remained constant, as intensity and accuracy of surveys are unlikely to have greatly improved. <br/><br/>Overall, populations in Ethiopia, Malawi, and South Africa appear stable; they are possibly stable in Angola (they were considered likely extinct here in the 2002 assessment); in Mozambique they are stable or increasing; in Namibia and Swaziland populations are increasing; but in Botswana, Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe populations are declining (Table 1). Of particular concern is that decline is being seen in Kenya and Tanzania, where the species is most numerous. However the world's largest single Plains Zebra population in Serengeti National Park appears stable. <br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/><br/>The Plains Zebra population in Angola has declined drastically since the 1960s and 1970s and has been extirpated from most of its former range in the country. Plains Zebra has likely been eliminated from Iona National Park (NP), and is probably extinct elsewhere along the coastal plain and neighboring regions of southwestern Angola (Pedro Vaz Pinto and Luis Verissimo pers. comm. 2015). Recent anecdotal reports of the species presence in Bikuar NP need confirmation. Plains Zebra remain extant in small groups in a trans-boundary population in Luengue-Luiana NP, due to animals moving from Bwabwata National Park in Namibia and there is a possibility of its presence elsewhere in southeast Kuando Cubango province (Pedro Vaz Pinto and Luis Verissimo pers. comm. 2015). Population size in the country is unknown.<br/><br/><strong>Botswana</strong><br/><br/>Nationwide total is about 99,500 Plains Zebra from a stratified sample count in 2012 (Botswana DWNP unpublished data). While the population is increasing significantly in Ngamiland and Central Botswana, there is a non-significant decreasing trend in Chobe, with no information on trends for the smaller populations in Ghanzi and the north-east and southern parts of the country. Countrywide the species was considered stable (or increasing non-significantly) in 2012, and has increased from about 35,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong><br/><br/>A 2008 survey recorded 62 Plains Zebra in Upemba NP, but none in Kunedelungu NP (Vanleeuwe 2009). This indicates a decline in the Congo population as &lt;1,000 were reported in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Ethiopia</strong><br/><br/>The 2014 nationwide population was about 7,500 zebra (F. Kebede, EWCA, unpublished data). This population overall appears stable since 2002. The population in Omo NP-Mago NP-Tama WR was estimated as 1,630 from a 1997 aerial survey (F. Kebede pers. comm.<em><em><em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em></em></em>), decreasing to 1,000 in a 2014 informed estimate. The Nechisar NP population remains stable at about 3,000 animals in both 1995 and 2014 (C. Zewdie and G. Wondimu, EWCO, unpublished data), and the Yabello WS (now Borena NP) population increased from 2,840 in a 1995 aerial survey (Thouless 1995) to an informed estimate of 3,500 in 2014 (F. Kebede unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Kenya</strong><br/><br/>While Plains Zebra remain numerous in Kenya the population appears to be declining. In 1995 the population was estimated as 152,490 from aerial surveys (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002); in surveys from 2008-2015 the population is estimated at only 98,820 animals (Kenya Wildlife Service 2015 unpublished data). This represents a decline of 35% in 20 years. Plains Zebra have been extirpated (or nearly so) from some protected areas (e.g. Kora NP and Sibilo NP; Thomas Butynski pers. comm. 2015), while in other areas densities remain high. Only about 10% of Plains Zebra are on protected lands in Kenya (Grunblatt <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1995), meaning that protection for zebras outside these areas is vital.<br/><br/>Plains Zebra populations have declined in Maasai Mara Nature Reserve (MMNR) and nearby ranches from wet season numbers as high as 60,764 ± 18201 in 1978 to 38,560 ± 10,935 in 2007 (Ogutu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011), although 2014 Kenya Wildlife Service aerial survey data indicated a population of 42,126. This represents the largest population in Kenya. Zebra tended not to be resident in MMNR during the wet season (December to May) although they remained in surrounding ranches. Fewer zebra now migrate in to the Mara region during the dry season, despite few changes in the source population in the Serengeti (Ogutu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In 1995 the Laikipia Plains Zebra population was considered to be increasing (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). Surveys conducted in 2001 and 2012 found a 9.6% reduction from 27,544 to 24,887±5,853 indicating that the population is roughly stable (Kinnaird <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Plains Zebra are the most abundant wildlife species in this area, yet like all wildlife are experiencing a decline since the 1980s.<br/><br/><strong>Malawi</strong><br/><br/>Aerial surveys from 2012 to 2015 report about 748 zebra in protected areas in Malawi. The largest population in Majete WR increased from 262 in 2012 to 571 in 2015 (D. Macpherson pers. comm. 2015). The second largest population in Nyika NP declined from 279 in 2013 to 153 in 2015 (Macpherson 2013 and pers. comm.). Vwaza Marsh WR, Kasungu NP and Liwonde NP each have less than 20 (D. Macpherson pers. comm. 2015). There are also small populations of Plains Zebra at three or four game ranches in Malawi.<br/><br/><strong>Mozambique</strong><br/><br/>Plains Zebra were likely eradicated from south-western Mozambique during 22 years of war (1964-1974; 1980-1992). Between 2002 and 2008, 1361 zebra were (re-)introduced to the western section of the newly created Limpopo National Park (LNP), from the adjoining Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa. Subsequent aerial surveys (2010, 2013) indicate a sharp reduction in zebra abundances in LNP and restriction of zebra distribution to the western boundary. Recent ground surveys (2014) documented natural range expansion of zebra into central LNP. Illegal hunting is widespread in LNP and may explain reduced zebra abundances. Zebra were not detected in Banhine National Park during 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2014 surveys.<br/><br/>The country-wide total is about 3,400 zebras in Mozambique. The population estimate from aerial surveys in Limpopo NP has declined from 494 in 2010 to 183 in 2013 due to illegal hunting (Kristoffer Everatt pers. comm. 2015). The population in Niassa Reserve is stable, with numbers remaining around 3,000 between the aerial survey in 1998 which estimated 2,854 zebras (1852-3855) and in 2014 which estimated 3,197 (2400-3994), although an anomalous survey in 2009 recorded 6,229 (5033-4672) possibly due to better observers that year (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2015). Plains Zebras are present in Magoe in Tete province, but no longer present in Banhina NP (2004-2014). Fourteen Plains Zebra were reintroduced to Gorongosa NP in 2012, but only one foal had been produced by 2015 (Marcelino Denja pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Namibia</strong><br/><br/>There are about 40,000 Plains Zebras in Namibia, with an estimated increasing trend due to populations on private/freehold land. Legislative changes during the 1960s-1970s in Namibia giving landowners user rights to wildlife has led to an increase in the populations of Hartmann’s mountain zebra, and has benefitted Plains Zebra as well. An aerial survey of Etosha NP in 2012 estimated 16,174 Plains Zebra, with an aerial survey of the north-east (Kavango East and Zambezi) estimating 1,421 Plains Zebras (Kenneth Uiseb, Namibia MET, unpublished data). In 2014, aerial surveys of the Zambezi Region (including Bwabwata, Mudumu and Nkasa Lupara national parks and communal conservancies) and Mangetti NP estimated 5,435 and 140 zebras respectively (Kenneth Uiseb, Namibia MET, unpublished data). It should be noted that the 950-2037 zebras in Bwabwata NP are the same population that has some animals moving in to Angola. The total number of Plains Zebra on private land is unknown, but is between 19,000 and 25,000 (Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Rwanda</strong><br/><br/>The only data on Plains Zebra from Rwanda are from a 2013 aerial survey that estimated 999 Plains Zebra in Akagera National Park (African Parks website). It is unlikely that there are many Plains Zebra outside this protected area.<br/><br/><strong>South Africa</strong><br/><br/>The Plains Zebra was assessed as Least Concern in the South African National Red List as the species remains widespread, common, and there are no major threats resulting in a range-wide population decline (Stears <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). The population is stable, consisting of at least 46,000 animals; in 2002 there were over 55,000 Plains Zebras estimated in the country (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). Kruger National Park has around 70% of the free-roaming population in South Africa with 29,000-43,450 individuals in 2012. This is the only South African population that is migratory. Plains Zebras are also present in the northern KwaZulu-Natal, and in Limpopo, North West, Free State and Northern Cape provinces, with large numbers on private land (9,411 individuals and 3,232 individuals on private land in the North West and Free State provinces respectively).<br/><br/><strong>South Sudan</strong><br/><br/>In 1980 there were 24,078 in the wet season and 29,460 in the dry season in Boma NP, and 3,889 in the wet season and 4,533 in the dry season in Jonglei National Park (Fay <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). A 2007 aerial survey saw a small group of Plains Zebra in Boma, and none in Jonglei (Fay <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). In 2007, 2008 and 2009 a few small group of Plains Zebra were seen during aerial surveys, and in 2013 there was an unconfirmed report of Plains Zebra from a charter plane pilot, but otherwise no Plains Zebras have been seen in South Sudan in recent years (Paul Elkan pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Swaziland</strong><br/><br/>There are about 2,900 Plains Zebras in Swaziland (Mickey Reilly unpublished data 2015). In the Kingdom of Swaziland’s Big Game Parks there are about 1,250: 320 recorded from an aerial count in Mkhaya in 2014, 850 estimated in Hlane, and about 80 estimated in Milwane. In Government parks there are about 185, and up to 800 on private land (although this is likely an over-estimate; Mickey Reilly unpublished data 2015). This represents an increase compared to 1000 Plains Zebra reported in Swaziland in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Tanzania</strong><br/><br/>Plains Zebras are still widespread and common in Tanzania with a population of over 260,000 (±20-30%) animals, however all but three populations appear to be declining (TAWIRI/NCAA unpublished data 2015), and the species is restricted to protected areas. The populations in the Serengeti Ecosystem and the Ngorongoro Crater appear stable, with 207,166 ±37,638 in a 2010 aerial survey of the Serengeti, and 4,942 in a total count of Ngorongoro Crater (Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority Ecological Monitoring Program, NEMP). The Serengeti population is the largest within the species’ range, and contains 42% of all wild Plains Zebras. The West Kilimanjaro population is possibly stable, with 1,632 in a 2013 total count. All other populations are declining or have an unknown trend. The Tarangire Manyara ecosystem population dropped from 33,330 ± 1,254 in 2004 to 15,662 ± 5,118 in 2011 (CIMU unpublished data), with other populations having a similar level of decline.<br/><br/><strong>Uganda</strong><br/><br/>There are 425 ± 636 Plains Zebras in Uganda, almost all in the Kidepo landscape (Wanyama <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Of these zebras, 154 are in Kidepo National Park, representing a decline from 651 in 1971 (Wanyama <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Some Plains Zebras are also present in Lake Mburo National Park. It is unlikely that there are any Plains Zebras outside the protected areas (Julian Fennessy pers. comm. 2015). Plains Zebras are now locally extinct in Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve, from over 2,000 in 1968 (Zwick <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998). No Plains Zebras were seen in Murchison Falls or Queen Elizabeth National Parks in a 2014 survey (Wanyama <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This represents a severe decline in this country from over 3,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Zambia</strong><br/><br/>There are between 8,000 and 16,000 Plains Zebra in Zambia, with populations declining in most protected areas (Peter Lindsay pers. comm. 2015). These zebras consist of about 9,400 in the protected area network, and over 2,000 on game ranches (Lindsay <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, 2014). There may have been a decline from over 18,000 Plains Zebra in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Zimbabwe</strong><br/><br/>There are over 4,000 Plains Zebras in Zimbabwe. In Hwange 2,155 were reported in 1999, and 1,685 ± 26 in Gonarezhou National Park in 2013 (Dunham <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). This latter population is thought to be increasing. Plains Zebra also occur in other protected areas and outside these areas in Zimbabwe, but we do not have the survey data to assess how many.",Decreasing,"Plains Zebra range from South Sudan and southern Ethiopia, east of the Nile River, to southern Angola and northern Namibia and northern South Africa (formerly ranging south of the Orange and Vaal Rivers to the Cape) (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Klingel 2013).

45173922,21473,Tapirus pinchaque,Endangered,A2cd+3cd; C1,2016,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Endangered due to an ongoing and suspected future decline inferred from habitat loss, fragmentation and hunting pressure. Population declines are estimated to be greater than 50% in the past 3 generations (33 years). Furthermore the causes of population decline have not ceased and are inferred to be greater than 50% decline in the next 3 generations (33 years). This is inferred from current trends of continued habitat loss, hunting estimates as well impacts of climate change, which will shift the suitable climatic conditions up the mountain. In addition there are estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next 2 generations (22 years). There has been and remains significant hunting pressure in Ecuador, however in Colombia and Peru the hunting pressure on this species still continues. It is extremely rare to encounter an area with Mountain Tapirs where they are not being over-hunted. Overall the mountain tapir population is fragmented as a result of human activities.&#160;There has also been widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining mountain tapir refuges. For example, cattle have been observed to be forming reproducing families in western Sangay National Park. Illegal mining is an important threat that is increasing population fragmentation, increasing contamination of watersheds and increasing illegal hunting. Mining projects in northern Peru and central Andes of Colombia threatens to destroy the headwater cloud forests and paramos of the scant population of mountain tapirs there.</p>","<p>The four major habitat types for <em>Tapirus pinchaque </em>are: Paramo, Jalca and Tropical montane forest. Elevations range from 1,400 m to the snowline (Downer 1997).</p>","<p>Formerly hunting pressure was the primary threat through most areas of the Mountain Tapir’s distribution (C. Downer pers. comm.) but today, poppy growing and its eradication, warfare and habitat fragmentation are currently the main threats on this species (E. Constantino pers. comm.). In some areas, hunting is decreasing due to local regulations and people’s increased awareness of this species’ rarity and conservation status. While a few Mountain Tapir populations may benefit because guerrilla presence which may relieve colonization pressure in Colombia by promoting the abandonment of conflict areas (C. Downer pers. comm.), most local biologists feel the presence of the guerrilla is having an overall negative impact on the species’ conservation. Additionally, the “actors” of the armed conflicts in Colombia (army, guerrilla, and paramilitaries) see the presence of field biologists and researchers in the areas that they control as a threat for their safety (Dávalos 2001, Semple 2000). The slow reproduction rate, large home range, and generally solitary nature of Mountain Tapirs make them particularly vulnerable to destruction of habitat and fragmentation by encroaching agriculture (Downer 1997). Habitat fragmentation is caused by conversion of forests and páramos to cattle ranching and agricultural lands. Another major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia and Peru is the development of new mining projects and illegal mining contaminating water sources.<br/>The major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia is human population growth in the Andean region.  People settling in the region need land, consumables and services, and their activities lead to habitat destruction.&#160; <br/></p><p>Additional threats include the development of hydroelectric dams, highways crossing protected areas, petroleum exploration, and electrical networks etc. There are numerous reports of tapir being hit by cars so infrastructure development through habitat is a potential major threat. There are numerous proposed highway and other projects in the Andes which would greatly increase vehicular mortalities. Once the construction of these highways is finalized, the vehicles will be able to drive at high speed and the animals crossing the roads will become even more vulnerable. Additionally, these roads will provide easier access to poachers, given the fact that the park lacks enough park rangers to patrol and protect the area. <br/>Tapir skin was used in the past for manufacture working tools (backpacks, ropes to ride horses, baskets etc.) and other things such as carpets and covers for beds. Traditional medicine makes use of tapir parts for medicinal purposes being commercialized in local markets.&#160; Also tapir parts are prescribed for medicinal purposes&#160; by shamans. <br/></p><p>Widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining Mountain Tapir refuges is a serious problem which will likely escalate in the near future. Cattle is a serious risk of transmission of infectious diseases and other etiological agents that they may carry. Disease transmission from cattle has been documented for Mountain, Baird’s and lowland tapirs in other locations. Another problem in Colombia are the fumigations being conducted in National Parks and all zones where cultivation of drugs can be found, including Andean forests in the Central and Oriental Cordilleras. These fumigations are authorized and promoted by the Colombian government, and are a major threat for the mountain tapir populations. The habitat is seriously affected and the animals can possibly be poisoned when in contact with the poison used for the fumigations (Round-Up), which is selective but can affect the availability of food resources.<br/>In Peru, there is a lack of protected areas big enough to maintain viable populations. Also the enforcement of environmental policies is weak.<br/>Global warming has the potential to decrease the suitable habitat available for mountain tapirs in the near future. If the temperature increases, the climatic conditions suitable for mountain tapir to occur will be shifting to higher altitudes, decreasing the capacity of the current protected areas to conserve mountain tapir habitat.&#160;&#160; </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Mountain Tapir population is fragmented as a result of human activities and the total population is estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next 2 generation (22 years).</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>Mountain Tapir (<em>Tapirus pinchaque)</em> is known from the Andean area of Columbia, Ecuador, and northernmost Peru were new records have been acquired from the&#160; southern Huancabanba depresure.

45181534,21212,Sylvilagus transitionalis,Vulnerable,A2ce,2019,2018-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species once had a widespread distribution across New England, USA.  Suitable habitat for the New England Cottontail has declined by an  estimated 86% since 1960, and the available habitat has become  increasingly fragmented (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fenderson <em>et al.</em>  2014). It is confirmed as Vulnerable because a population size reduction has occurred  since 1994 and in the last ten years it is suspected to be greater than  30%. The decline is continuing due to further habitat  destruction/modification and fragmentation resulting from urbanization  and suburbanization, and competition with the expansion of the range of  the New England Cottontail. Currently New England Cottontails occupy  less than 15% of their historic range, and they are considered  Endangered and are protected (no hunting) in Maine and New Hampshire.  They are considered a game animal in the remainder of their range. There  is a substantial effort underway to increase abundance of habitat in a  large portion of the historic range of NEC. However, much of this effort  will require years for managed lands to develop into suitable habitat,  and a substantial portion will never be suitable given site  characteristics. Likewise, introductions of captive-bred rabbits have  had some modest successes and also failures. These have not offset  continued losses. As a result, most populations continue to decline in  the occupied range. The USFWS (2015) denied a petition to list the New  England Cottontail as an endangered or threatened species and to  designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  This decision is controversial based on available data of population  estimates, the misrepresentation of the historical range of the species,  and failure to acknowledge that ongoing attempts to conserve the  species have been over-stated.","The New England Cottontail occupies areas of open woods and shrubs  (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), often with sandy soils. This species is a  habitat specialist. It historically occupied early successional forests  that became abundant when farmlands were abandoned, and the maturation  of these forests into closed-canopy stands caused decline of this  species beginning in the 1960s (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is  typically found close to streams, swamps, ponds, or lakes in dense cover  with a shrub dominated understory (generally &gt;20,000 stems/ha), and  will rarely venture more than 5 m from escape cover (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2018). Radio-tracking suggests New England Cottontails are using the  invasive Japanese Barberry (<em>Berberis thunbergii</em>) as an important cover  type, particularly when Eastern Cottontail populations are present  (Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>Minimum patch sizes of 2.5 ha have been  suggested for New England Cottontail populations, based on foraging  efficiency in winter settings (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993). However,  because summer home range size is greater, this may be too conservative  of a target (Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>The diet of New England Cottontails  includes a variety of herbaceous plants, fruits, and seeds, and in the  winter it consumes woody species (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).<br/><br/>Outside  of the breeding season New England Cottontails are often solitary. They  have an average litter size of 4.2 young/litter, the average female  produces 2.5 litters during the mid-March through August breeding season  (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2018). Adults range in size from 38.6–43.0 cm (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The New England Cottontail is most threatened by habitat destruction (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). Urban-suburban sprawl and industrial development expand into and  fragment the habitat of this species. These areas are better suited to  the Eastern Cottontail (<em>S. floridanus</em>). Recent genetic studies suggest  this population isolation is leading to moderate-to-strong genetic drift  in many portions of the range (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>New  England Cottontails have historically declined due to maturation of  second-growth forests and fragmentation of suitable habitat (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). The conversion of native shrublands to other land uses,  confusion with Eastern Cottontails by sportsmen, and lack of education  on existence, biology, and habitat requirements of this species cause  problems for the conservation of this species.<br/><br/>Competition with Eastern Cottontails may also place pressure on New England Cottontail populations (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). Decline in the New England Cottontail coincides with growth in  Eastern Cottontail populations. Captive trials suggest that the species  may not be exerting much competition (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008),  however, telemetry estimates indicate that habitat usage for the New  England Cottontail shifts where the two species overlap in distribution  (Cheeseman 2017).","The New England Cottontail is rare to scarce in many portions of its  range. Recent census efforts suggest that around 17,000 New England Cottontails exist in the wild, with the majority of these found in  Connecticut and Massachusetts (10,000 and 4,600 individuals,  respectively, USFWS 2015). Population estimates are smaller in New York  (1,600 individuals) and Maine (700 individuals), and are extremely  limited in New Hampshire (&lt;180 individuals) and Rhode Island (&lt;100  individuals) (USFWS 2015). However, these estimates may be overstated,  as they assume rabbits occupy all known available habitat within focal  areas, which is contravened by most field studies. Many rabbits in  Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, southeast New York, and  western Connecticut are found on small habitat patches (&lt;3 ha), which  probably only support 3-4 individuals per patch (Barbour and Litvaitis  1993, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008). As patches of less than 2.5 ha are  likely population sinks (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993) many of these  patches are unlikely to contribute to New England Cottontail population  recruitment.<br/><br/>Recent survey efforts have also suggested population  decline since the early 2000s in the Merrimack River Valley of New  Hampshire, northward from Manchester to Concord, and in northern Rhode  Island (USFWS 2015). Historical estimates suggest that the New England  cottontail peaked in abundance and distribution in the 1960s (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008), benefiting from succession that occurred on land cleared in the mid-19<sup>th </sup>and early 20<sup>th </sup>centuries (Foster <em>et al.</em>  2002). Across much of their range, including areas of eastern New York,  genetic evidence suggests highly restricted gene flow, strong  population fragmentation and genetic drift (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cheeseman 2017).",Decreasing,"New England Cottontails historically occurred throughout  southern Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, eastern New York,  Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Whitaker and Hamilton (1998) include a  small region of southern Quebec. A study by Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  (2008) estimated that the current area of occupancy (AOO) in its historic  range is 12,180 km², approximately 86% less than the occupied range in  1960. This study showed small patches of populations existing in coastal  southeastern Maine, coastal and Merrimack River valley region of  southern New Hampshire, southeastern New York, western and some of  eastern Connecticut (east of Connecticut River), western Massachusetts,  parts of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Estimates suggest  ongoing range contraction, with 2% of the range of New England  Cottontails lost per year (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, USFWS 2015).","Overall, numbers of cottontails harvested have not declined, but  the percent of New England Cottontails in the harvest has. The species  is hunted for sport, for food, and for ornamental/decorative goods.  Cottontail hunting has been prohibited in Maine since 2004 and New  Hampshire prohibits take of any cottontails in areas where the New  England Cottontail occurs (USFWS 2015).",Terrestrial,"The New England Cottontail was recommended by Chapman and  Stauffer in 1979 to be listed by the IUCN as a species of special  concern due to the significant differences between it and the Eastern  Cottontail, which is now sympatric in much of its range (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990). In 2004 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  began consideration of this species to be listed as a threatened or  endangered species (Litvaitis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Protection  under the Endangered Species Act was declined based on known scattered  occurrences across its range as well as presence within protected areas  (Department of the Interior - Fish and Wildlife Service 2004). In 2006, a  subsequent review found sufficient evidence to designate the species as  a candidate and begin a warranted-but-precluded 12 month findings on  the New England Cottontail (Department of the Interior - Fish and  Wildlife Service 2006). In 2015 a decision not to list the New England  Cottontail was made based on the assumption that populations had been  artificially high due to age of succession in New England habitats and  were subsequently declining as habitats aged (USFWS 2015). <br/><br/>Very  little good habitat for the New England Cottontail is protected, and  tracts of scrub oak barrens should be purchased and protected.  Conservation of critical habitat and establishment and management of  “Important Mammal Areas” containing known populations, with appropriate  publicity and public education programs have been implemented.<br/><br/>The  New England Cottontail is in need of more research, including surveying  and population monitoring, research on nest sites, dispersal, habitat,  use of corridors, response to climatic change and stochastic events,  effects of sport hunting, competition with other lagomorphs, and  response to invasive vegetative species (especially how invasive plants  affect spread of parasites and disease).<br/><br/>Captive breeding and  reintroductions have been ongoing through work at the Roger Williams  Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island.

Populations seem to be healthy, overall, although there exists some concern over range contractions, especially in the southeastern USA. The status of distinct subspecies along the Pacific coast is unclear.","<p>The Snowshoe Hare<em> </em>is associated with boreal and mixed deciduous forest of North America. It requires mixed forest with dense understory, which it uses as cover. Summer pelage is always brown; winter pelage color depends on snow duration and ephemerality and is white in most of the range, with winter brown morphs found in &lt;10% of the range almost all within a narrow strip along the maritime western Pacific coast of North America (Mills <em>et al.</em> 2018, Nagorsen 1983). Typically, stands aged 25-40 years are ideal. The Snowshoe Hare also seems to favor edge habitat. Diet consists mostly of grasses, forbs, sedges, and ferns (Murray 2003, Krebs and Murray 2018).<br/> <br/> The total length of Snowshoe Hares is 36.0 - 52.0 cm (Banfield 1974, Hall 1981). Their breeding season extends from March to September and is subject to photoperiod and hormonal control (Murray 2003, Zimova <em>et al.</em> 2018). The average number of litters varies according to location with 1.9 litters per year in Alaska and 3.8 litters per year in Wisconsin (Murray 2003).

Populations in the boreal forest fluctuate according to a 10-year cycle, where their densities may vary 100-fold over the span of several years. Southern populations may be noncyclic or fluctuate with reduced amplitude (Krebs and Murray 2018, Krebs <em>et al.</em> Boutin 2018).

This may be related to habitat loss and increases in generalized predator (especially Coyote <em>Canis latrans</em>) numbers. Climate change is also likely to affect hare distribution and abundance, as decreasing snow duration increases camouflage mismatch of winter white hares on brown snowless backgrounds which in turn increases predation-induced mortality (Mills <em>et al</em>. 2013, Zimova <em>et al. </em>2016).",Stable,"The Snowshoe Hare appears in boreal and mixed deciduous forests of North America.

The efficacy of such efforts usually has not been monitored carefully. In some cases hares have been stocked in an attempt to bolster the populations. This method also seems to have limited utility because captive-bred hares are highly vulnerable to predation and transplanted wild hares often succumb to death in captivity during transport.

It was listed on the IUCN Red  List of Threatened Species as NT – Near Threatened in 2008 (Barry and  Lazell 2008).

The rate of hunting has  increased significantly recently because of the&#160;breakdown of governance  since the coup d'etat in 2009, leading to increased artisanal mining in  forest areas,  increased hunting, and increased opportunistic rosewood cutting  throughout the species's&#160;range. If this&#160;deteriorates&#160;yet further, it is&#160;likely that a&#160;Near Threatened listing will be warranted.","This largely terrestrial, diurnal species is present in tropical humid lowland and montane forest, and tropical dry deciduous forest in the west of its range. An agile climber, it has occassionally been seen in trees, and it is also an adept swimmer. It has been recorded preying on crayfish in freshwater (Dunham 1997). It is recorded from secondary forests, although only where immediately adjacent to primary forest, and can be found at the forest edge, close to areas of slash-and-burn cultivation.&#160;<br/><br/>Ring-tailed Vontsira was more active and had a higher probability of occupancy in degraded forest sites; however, occupancy diminished closer to villages. This negative association with villages may be a reflection of intense hunting pressure (Farris and Kelly 2011, Farris <em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;Farris&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;in review a).&#160;<br/><br/>In one survey area, Ring-tailed Vontsira was primarily camera-trapped in duos. It was primarily diurnal, with some crepuscular and limited nocturnal activity perhaps related to seasonal changes (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b).<br/><br/>This species is known to scavenge&#160;regularly&#160;in human refuse in primary forest camps. Animals typically spend the night in burrows in the forest. Although sometimes solitary, it is a social species usually found in pairs with up to three offspring (Dunham 1998). The gestation period is unclear, but it appears to be between 52 and 90 days, after which a single young is born (Goodman 2003). Sexual maturity is attained at about two years.","Ring-tailed Vontsira remains widespread, occurs in a number of protected areas and even persists in forest fragments. As with most forest-dwelling animals in Madagascar, deforestation to cultivated land, hunting and negative effect of introduced carnivores are the most important threats.&#160;<br/><br/>Deforestation and forest disturbance across its range has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood, and hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>This species is persecuted for raiding local poultry (Golden 2005) and is&#160;killed by dogs accompanying hunters in the forest. Hunting and/or bushmeat consumption presents a serious concern for Ring-tailed Vontsira across the eastern rainforest. Golden <em>et al</em>. (in press) reported 21 Ring-tailed Vontsiras hunted in one year at Betampona Strict Nature Reserve. In the Makira landscape a total of 169&#160;Ring-tailed Vontsiras were consumed within four villages (144 households) from 2005 to 2011 near the Makira Natural Park. Hunting rates were positively associated with&#160;Ring-tailed Vontsira&#160;occupancy, meaning hunters appear to be focusing their efforts in non-degraded forest where it is most abundant. In addition, Ring-tailed Vontsira consistently was the most purchased and most trapped small carnivore across the landscape, which is likely to reflect its overall apparent abundance and higher level of activity in and around anthropogenic areas (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review a).<br/><br/>Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 suggested that 385 (24%) of 1,631 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Ring-tailed Vontsira in the preceding year. Certain parts of the animal (e.g. the tail) are used for cultural purposes by some tribal groups (Goodman 2003). Competition with the introduced Small Indian Civet&#160;<em>Viverricula indica</em> and feral cats and dogs may threaten this species in parts of its range. Ring-tailed Vontsira had very strong temporal activity overlap with dogs and moderate overlap with feral/wild cats, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b).&#160;<br/><br/>Co-occurrence models demonstrate that the Vontsira does not occur at sites where Small Indian Civet activity is very high, and that Vontsira probability of occupancy is greatly decreased in the presence of Small Indian Civets (Farris&#160;<em>et al</em>. in review c).","<p>The available information suggests that Ring-tailed Vontsira is common.

It avoids open habitats, but may occur even in small fragments of woodland in farmland or near villages, and usually is absent from rainforests, dense woodlands and woodland-moist savanna mosaics (e.g., miombo woodland in Angola; Delibes and Gaubert 2013). The Common Genet feeds mainly on small mammals, but will also take birds, other small vertebrates, insects, and fruits (Delibes and Gaubert 2013).&#160;Is not uncommonly found in proximity human buildings, people and their domestic animals, which could have implications for disease transmission (Admasu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).","Locally, Common Genets have been and are still killed for their meat, body parts, skin and fur. In Portugal this species is illegally killed in predator trapping for hunting management and this,&#160;together with road-kills,&#160;may be the most important sources of anthropogenic mortality. In south Portugal, although Genets seem to avoid highways, they are particularly sensitive to national roads (two paved lanes). Two thirds of the road-kills recorded over a 10-year period were subadults and the road-kill index was <em>ca</em>&#160;12.8 individuals/100 km/year (F. Carvalho unpubl. data).&#160;Overall, however, it is believed that these sources or mortality do not currently threaten local populations.

45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45813880,4185,Ceratotherium simum,Near Threatened,,2020,2020-01-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The reason for assessing this species as Near Threatened and not Least Concern continues to be the continued and high poaching threat and illegal demand for horn in SE Asia (especially Viet Nam and China), increased involvement of organised international criminal syndicates in rhino poaching (see Emslie <em>et al.</em> (2019)&#160;<a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>&#160;for further details). Protection efforts depend on significant Range State expenditure and effort, and if these were to decline rampant poaching could seriously threaten numbers (well in excess of 30% over three generations). Declining state budgets for conservation in real terms, declining capacity in some areas and increasing arrests of Southeast Asians for rhino crimes in African Range States are all of concern. Estimated White Rhino numbers have declined 15% from 2012–17 in response to increased poaching. This decline has largely been because of a major decline in the largest subpopulation in Greater Kruger due to poaching. While absolute numbers poached in this park continue to decline, so have White Rhino numbers with the result that in relative terms poaching has remained at unsustainable levels. Fortunately, White Rhino numbers have been increasing in many other populations and since White Rhino poaching peaked in 2014 it has declined in response to considerably increased law enforcement and protection efforts. Reported poaching in the major Range State South Africa is also down in 2019. While the White Rhino is close to having less than 10,000 mature individuals, it would not meet any other of the additional criteria under C1 or C2.<br/><br/><strong>In summary the rationale for treating White Rhino as Near Threatened and not Least Concern is that in the&#160;</strong><strong>numbers could decline significantly in the&#160;</strong><strong>absence of, or significant reduction of current conservation measures.&#160;</strong><strong>Despite White Rhino point estimates declining by an estimated 15% from 2012–17, numbers are&#160;</strong><strong>nowhere near reaching critical thresholds under criteria A2 or A4 (see Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 4 and 5 in the attached S</strong><strong>upplementary Information document). Recorded White Rhino poaching has been declining since 2014.</strong></p>",The species is found in grassland in bushveld savanna habitats. It is a grazer.,"<p>The main threat to the population is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. Until recently, at the continental species level, poaching of White Rhinos has not had a serious impact on overall numbers of White Rhinos in Africa, with poaching losses in parts of the range being surpassed by encouraging growth rates in others. However following declines in the largest subpopulation (Greater Kruger) continental numbers declined by an estimated 15% from 2012 to 2015. While poaching levels increased dramatically from 2007 to 2014, numbers of White Rhinos reported poached have declined in each of the four years every year since, and half year reported poaching in 2019 in the major Range State, South Africa indicates this trend is possibly continuing. See attached Supplementary Material for graphs of reported poaching numbers by year.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in declining live sale prices and reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales at lower prices). However, so far there appears to be a consolidation of White Rhino into larger subpopulations. For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).<br/><br/>Poaching and civil wars in both Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring South Sudan had a devastating impact on Northern White Rhino. Whilst poaching pressure initially increased during civil unrest and war in the late 1990s, good reproduction enabled the population to remain relatively stable. However, since 2003, poaching escalated and the population declined rapidly with 11 carcasses found in a three-month period between March and May 2004. Confirmed numbers of Northern White Rhino fell from 30 individuals in April 2003 to just four in August 2005. No live rhino have been seen since 2006 or signs of live rhino (spoor or dung) reported since 2007 despite intensive systematic foot surveys. It is believed that the Northern White Rhino has probably gone extinct in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rumours persist of possible survivors in war-torn South Sudan, but as yet there has been no conclusive evidence of this being the case.&#160;</p>","<p>As of 31 December 2017, there were an estimated 18,064 White Rhino in the wild.

As of Dec 2008 there were an estimated 750 in captivity worldwide.<br/><br/>Once widespread in the bushveld areas of southern Africa south of the Zambezi River, the Southern White Rhino was on the brink of extinction by the end of the 19th century having been reduced to just one small population of approximately 20–50 animals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, by the end of 2012, after years of protection and many translocations, the subspecies had grown to an estimated 21,316 wild animals. Following poaching increases estimated numbers had declined about 15% to 18,064 by the end of 2017 with bootstrapped 90% confidence levels of 17,212 to 18,915. South Africa remains the stronghold for this subspecies (~86.5%) conserving an estimated 18,933 individuals by the end of&#160;2012. Smaller reintroduced subpopulations occur within former Range States in Botswana, Namibia, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe; subpopulations of free-ranging Southern White Rhino have also been established outside their historical range in Kenya, Zambia (Emslie and Brooks 1999) and more recently Uganda although Uganda is a former <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ceratotherium simum cottoni</span>&#160;Range State and an ~3,500 year old White Rhino subfossil indicates at one stage Kenya was also once a White Rhino Range State. Numbers of White Rhino under private ownership continue to increase.<br/><br/>In the only confirmed surviving wild subpopulation in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Northern White Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. s. cottoni</span>) numbers declined rapidly from 30 in April 2003 due to an upsurge in poaching, and surveys in 2006 confirmed the presence of only four rhinos (Emslie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006). Numbers are believed to have stood at around 2,360 in 1960 (Emslie and Brooks 1999). However based largely on extensive and systematic foot surveys which failed to sight live rhino and find any signs (spoor and dung) this subpopulation is now considered probably extinct. Reports of a few possible Northern White Rhino surviving in a remote part of Southern Sudan have yet to be confirmed. The last four potential breeding Northern White Rhino in captivity were moved to a private conservancy in Kenya in the hope that a move to more wild conditions would&#160;stimulate them to breed. While the two females came into oestrus and mated no calves have been born and the two males have subsequently died. Assisted reproductive methods are being developed in the hope of being able to conserve some Northern White Rhino genes.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Two subspecies of White Rhino are currently recognized, the Northern (NWR) and the Southern (SWR), each having a strikingly discontinuous range in recent times. However there is fossil evidence the species used to have a continuous distribution and there is genetic evidence of probable post divergence secondary contact during the last interglacial (14,000 to 26,000 years ago) facilitated by savanna grassland expansion at that time (Moodley <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>The Northern White Rhino (NWR) used to range over parts of northwestern Uganda, southern Chad, southwestern South Sudan, the eastern part of Central African Republic, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sydney 1965). The previous only confirmed population in Garamba National Park in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is now considered probably extinct. Despite systematic ground surveys over probable range and additional foot patrols and aerial reconnaissance no live rhinos have been seen since 2006 and no fresh sign since 2007. There continue to be unconfirmed reports/rumours of rhino in southern Sudan but these have not been reliably confirmed and wildlife poaching in this area has reportedly increased and so it is unlikely any still survive. The last four potential breeding Northern White Rhino in captivity in Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic were translocated to a private conservancy in Kenya in the hope this would stimulate their breeding but despite mating no offspring were produced before the two old males died, and it appears the females will not breed despite attempts at inter-crossing. These two non-breeding females form the only current confirmed living NWR but cannot be included in the Red List assessments as they haven't bred since reintroduction back into the wild.&#160;Any future conservation of adaptive NWR genes now is dependent of successfully developing new assisted reproduction techniques.&#160;Researchers have collected oocytes from the two surviving NWR females and have sperm cells from five NWR that have all since died. The later could be used in IVF efforts. Advanced cellular techniques offer the potential to boost founder genetic diversity as there are stored cells and tissues from a greater number of NWR than for natural gametes. If Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to produce primordial germ cells, then there is a possibility to create oocytes and sperm from other dead NWR. If IVF can be successfully developed with embryos implanted in surrogate SWR mothers, then it should be possible to produce NWR calves. The latter when grown up could be used to create a self-sustaining population of rhinos. IVF inter-crossing could also be attempted. In time if such assisted reproductive methods can be successfully developed then once numbers have built up sufficiently some of these animals could be reintroduced back into secure areas of former range or close to former range in East Africa. There can be no guarantee's such techniques will be successful but at this stage progress has been made in creating embryos in the lab.<br/><br/>The Southern White Rhino was on the brink of extinction by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>&#160;century (<em>c.</em>&#160;1895) having been reduced to just one small population of approximately 20–50 animals in KwaZulu-Natal, after settlers had over-hunted them for sport and to clear land for agriculture throughout almost all of their historical range&#160;(Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, by the end of 2015, after years of protection and many translocations (Emslie and Brooks 1999), the subspecies had grown to ~20,000 animals in the wild and semi-wild (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019) in over 400 subpopulations. The Southern White Rhino is now the most numerous of the rhino taxa, with South Africa remaining the stronghold for this subspecies despite increased poaching.<br/><br/>Southern White Rhino numbers increased rapidly from 1992-2010, averaging +7.1%/year. However population growth then slowed as poaching increased, with numbers declining from 2012 onwards.&#160;The ~15% decline in estimated continental White Rhino numbers from 2012–2017 can largely be accounted for by a drop in estimated numbers in the largest population, in South Africa’s Kruger National Park (KNP), which has been severely affected by poaching since 2007. Despite absolute numbers of White Rhinos being reported poached declining in Kruger over the last four years, so has the number of White Rhino numbers in the park. To a much lesser extent this population (and some others) were also negatively affected by a recent very bad drought. The result is that as a % of the population, poaching in Kruger NP has remained at unsustainably high levels. This is especially the case when one considers evidence that indicates some poached carcasses in this and other very large Parks are not detected (Ferreira <em>et al.</em> 2018; N. Anderson and R. du Toit pers. comm.).&#160;Fortunately some of the Kruger Park decline has been partially cancelled out by increases elsewhere - especially on private land in South Africa as well as in some other Range States. Numbers&#160;on privately-owned wild populations in South Africa that provided estimates for both 2017 and 2018 increased by +6.9% while numbers on the largest semi-wild CBO population also increased by +6.8% over the year. Numbers of White Rhino also increased by 3.1% from 2017–18 in the rest of Africa outside of South Africa (2,442 to 2,517) with just over half of this likely to have been from exports of live animals from South Africa in 2018. 90% Confidence Levels around continental Southern White Rhino estimates (derived by bootstrapping using calculated or estimated precision around estimates) for end 2017 were estimated at 17,212–18,915 (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p>    <p>Sizeable populations occur in the greater Kruger National Park (which incorporates additional private and state reserves) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (the original source of all surviving Southern White Rhino alive today), but also occur in numerous state protected areas and private reserves (some of which are also well protected) throughout the country. Live sales, limited sport hunting and ecotourism have historically provided incentives which has resulted in a significant expansion of range and numbers on private land - especially in the major Range State South Africa. There are now more White Rhino on private land in South Africa than there are rhino in the whole of the rest of Africa. However increased poaching since 2007, resultant significantly increased security costs and reduced and limited economic incentives for their conservation have resulted in significantly reduced demand for White Rhino. Live sale prices of surplus White Rhino have declined significantly (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019) and an increasing number of owners seeking to get rid of their rhino. If it expands to larger populations this trend may threaten the continued expansion of range, and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales). Lower removal rates from established populations will negatively affect metapopulation growth rates in future as well as reduce budgets for conservation. There are smaller reintroduced subpopulations within the historical range of the species in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). The&#160;small number that survived in Mozambique were poached out, but some animals have crossed the border into Mozambique from Kruger Park in South Africa. While they used to have a very limited lifespan if not chased back across the border into South Africa small numbers now survive in some areas due to improved protection.&#160;Populations of Southern White Rhino have also been introduced outside of the known former range of the subspecies to Kenya, Uganda and to Zambia (Emslie and Brooks 1999, Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2007). Uganda was previously a Northern White Rhino range state and so the species has been reintroduced to this country. Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2018) work suggests that some form of White Rhino could have been native to Zambia and Kenya prior to recent historical times.<br/><br/>An estimated four White Rhino still live in the wild two other African countries, but these are remnants of animals introduced well outside the historical range of the species.<br/><br/>While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the last two hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya and northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhino, presumably similar to the northern race (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ceratotherium simum cottoni</span>), was widespread and a part of the East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could easily kill such tame animals (Brett 1993). This is based on the White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year from Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a White Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as a species but not <em>C. s. simum</em> as a subspecies has probably been reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a White Rhino hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be confirmed but merits further investigation.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries, the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons. For this reason, only whole countries of occurrence are indicated on the range maps produced by the AfRSG. However, numbers by species and subspecies are routinely summarised at a continental level. Estimated numbers by country as of the end of 2017 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>) were South Africa 15,625, Namibia 975, Kenya 513 (with 510 <em>C. s. simum</em> and 3 <em>C. s. cottoni</em>), Botswana 452, Zimbabwe 367, Eswatini 66, Mozambique 29, Uganda 22, Zambia 14. There were an additional one and three animals respectively out of range in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal but these are not historical Range States for the species. Bootstrapped estimates of 90% confidence levels around the total point estimate for 2017 were 17,212 to 18,915. Due to incomplete information from three South African provinces at the time of writing it is not possible to provide an updated end 2018 continental estimate. Indications are that South African 2018 numbers are likely to be similar or slightly lower than 2017. End 2018 estimates for other countries were Namibia 1,082, Kenya 664 (622 SWR, 2 NWR), Botswana 401, Zimbabwe 357, Eswatini 79, Mozambique 28, Uganda 25 and Zambia 11. The continued existence of four WR out of range in West Africa is not confirmed.</p>","It has been estimated that around 95% of horn sourced in Africa for illegal markets in Asia in 2016 and 2017 came from poached animals in the wild (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019). In some cases horn for illegal markets has been stolen or illegally sold from horn stockpiles/private trophies/museum exhibits. “Pseudo-hunting” where sport hunting has been undertaken by individuals from non-traditional hunting countries with the aim of illegally providing horn to illegal markets has also been responsible for some of the illegal horn getting onto end-user markets although this has reduced considerably since South Africa implemented a number of measures in 2012. At one stage as much as 18% of the horn sourced for illegal markets came from this source (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2012) but most recent estimates suggest this source only contributes 0.7% (Emslie <em>et al. </em>2019). Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat, but this forms part of routine biological management of the species to meet genetic and demographic goals. This is because many established wild subpopulations require regular removals to prevent “overstocking” and maintain rapid population growth rates. Maintaining rapid underlying population growth rates also minimises loss of genetic diversity over time due to genetic drift. Given the high price of sport-hunting, and clamp down on pseudo-hunting by South Africa in 2012, only about 75 White Rhino are currently sport hunted per year in Africa. This is less than 0.5% of the population annually. For more information see Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>.",Terrestrial,"<p>Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new subpopulations both within and outside the species’ former ranger. However, increasing black market prices for rhino horn, increased poaching of rhino and involvement of criminal syndicates in recent years pose a significant threat to rhino subpopulations. Strategically, White Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long-term security. In Southern Africa live sale of White Rhinos on auction (and limited sport hunting of surplus males) has also created incentives for private sector conservation and generated much needed funds which can help pay the high cost of successfully monitoring, protecting and managing rhino. Almost half of the White Rhino across Africa are now managed by the private sector throughout Africa with the majority in South Africa (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, as discussed above, incentives are declining while protection costs and risks have increased resulting in some owners getting rid of their rhino.<br/><br/>By 1977, all African rhino species were listed on CITES Appendix I, and all international commercial trade in rhinos and their products was prohibited. However, following a continued increase in numbers, the South African population of Southern White Rhino was downlisted in 1994 to Appendix II, but only for trade in live animals to “approved and acceptable destinations” and for the (continued) export of hunting trophies. Numbers have almost trebled since then. In 2004, Eswatini's (formerly Swaziland) Southern White Rhino were also downlisted to CITES Appendix II, but only for live export and for limited export of hunting trophies according to specified annual quotas. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of the major consumer states and law enforcement effort has been stepped up in many consumer countries. Demand reduction initiatives are also underway in key implicated states such as Viet Nam.<br/><br/>In addition to local, national, international and continental initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the South African Development Community (SADC) Rhino Management Group , a recently revitalised East African Rhino Management Group and the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group. IUCN SSC's African Rhino Specialist Group is the continental coordinating body for rhino conservation in Africa. In addition to National Rhino Plans there is a Continental African Rhino Range States Conservation Plan. IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group is the continental coordinating body for rhino conservation in Africa.<br/><br/>For a more detailed summary of conservation actions see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>.

Declines are driven by hunting for meat and trade in horns combined with extensive habitat loss and degradation in mainland southeast Asia and Java, Sabah, and Kalimantan. The global population is estimated at approximately 8,000 individuals of which about 60% occur in the deciduous dipterocarp forests of eastern Cambodia. Declines in the Indochinese population are likely to approach the threshold (80% ongoing decline) for listing as Critically Endangered. However, a global categorization as Critically Endangered under A2 (past decline) this would have required a 1995 (three generations ago) global population of greater than 39,000 individuals. Given a substantial proportion of the population and range decline in mainland southeast Asia occurred prior to 1995 it is unlikely that sufficient high quality non-heavily hunted habitat existed in the mid 1990s to support such a substantial global population (at current densities in little-hunted parts of Cambodia, there are about two Bantengs per square kilometre – thus about 20,000 km² of similar range would have been required). As such the listing as Endangered is maintained, but the global decline rate during this period is likely to have been closer to 80% than to 50%. Somewhat reduced decline rates are expected to continue for the next 3 generations, but these are likely still to exceed a 50% loss.","<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Wharton (1968) summarized information about Banteng habitat from throughout its range and he concluded that on the Asian mainland it avoids evergreen forest and even extensive tracts of closed canopy semi-evergreen forest, and is usually within more open dry deciduous forests; but within the more humid areas of Java and Borneo it occupies secondary forest formations resulting from logging and fires, and enters tracts of sub-humid forest on occasion. However, on mainland South-east Asia, human use of these preferred areas has increased and may have forced residual groups of surviving Banteng to retreat to relatively closed formations where consequently they now overlap more with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em>; although good evidence for such an assertion is lacking. On the eastern plains of Cambodia where the species remains numerous, but human use is relatively high, there is no evidence for any change in ecology. In Myanmar, Banteng is reported to prefer flat or undulating terrain with light deciduous (particularly dipterocarp indaing forest) or mixed deciduous and evergreen forest, with grassy glades which burn annually, and patches of bamboo; but it has purportedly retreated to denser hill forest in the face of advancing cultivation. (Peacock 1933, Wharton 1968, Tun Yin 1967, Prater 1971). Similarly in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Lao PDR, Banteng occurs&#160;(or occurred) in open mainly deciduous forest with glades, parklands, and dense forest patches; and ‘it is claimed by some that they prefer rocky, slightly hilly country, but they are certainly at home wherever the Kouprey [<em>Bos sauveli</em>] is found. Their range in Cambodia [and elsewhere in South-east Asia] suggests that Banting [sic] are more adaptable than Kouprey and perhaps less exacting in their habitat requirements’ (Wharton 1957, 1968). Recently the attachment to open, more deciduous forest types was reported in Xe Pian National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Steinmetz 2004). The documented and reported distribution of the species in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (based on many sources, but principally summarized in Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999 and AWCSG 2011) quite clearly corresponds in large part to the distribution of deciduous dipterocarp forest, but also includes other habitats especially mosaic habitats that include open-canopy formations and grasslands, including for example pine forests. In contrast there is a clear paucity of records of Banteng from extensive tracts of closed canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, with no records from the heart of any such dense forests. The supposition that it might prefer rocky, slightly hilly country has not been borne out by recent observations. In the Eastern Plains Landscape, Cambodia, Gray (<span lang=""EN-CA"">2012)<span lang=""EN-CA"">, based on analysis of camera-trap records, considered that&#160;Banteng occurred in both very open deciduous dipterocarp forest and denser mixed deciduous forest. It was also suggested that, in <span lang=""EN-US"">the largely homogenous deciduous dipterocarp forest of the Cambodian Eastern Plains Landscape small patches of mixed deciduous forest are important for Banteng at the height of the dry and burning seasons.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">In Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) Banteng inhabits tropical lowland and upland dipterocarp forest, lower montane forest, seasonal freshwater swamp forest and beach forest <span lang=""EN-CA"">(<span lang=""EN-CA"">Melletti and Burton 2014)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. It also uses open grassland, mature timber plantations (7 years), and abandoned cultivated land. Forest edges, interior openings, abandoned logging roads and river banks are important for foraging, socializing and movement <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Gardner 2015)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. Human disturbance heavily influences habitat use. In forest habitat that is mature, Banteng travels to interior grassy openings within the forest to forage or travels to the forest edge to forage during undisturbed hours (Gardner 2015).</span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">In Java Banteng occurs in semi-deciduous monsoon forest with small clearings, more open grassland-monsoon forest mosaics, and ‘parkland’ formations (Halder 1976, Hommel 1987, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008, based on unpubl. data 1991–2002).</span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Banteng generally occurs from sea level up to at least 2,100 m asl (Hoogerwerf 1970, National Research Council 1983, Pudyatmoko 2004, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 base on unpubl. data 1991–2002). The observed maximum elevation of Banteng in Sabah is approximately 1,330 m a.s.l. (P. Gardner pers. obs).<br/> <br/> Banteng reportedly drinks large quantities of water and prefers feeding grounds near a permanent water supply (Hoogerwerf 1970). When conditions are favourable it drinks daily, preferring standing water; but during droughts animals can survive several days without drinking (National Research Council 1983). Mineral licks are also an important feature of Banteng habitat; in coastal regions which lack mineral licks animals seem to meet their mineral requirements by occasionally drinking seawater (Halder 1976, Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Alikodra 1987, S. Hedges pers. obs.).<br/> <br/><span lang=""EN-CA"">Although probably a grazer by preference Banteng should perhaps be considered an intermediate feeder since it can and does consume a lot of browse and fruits depending on season and local food availability. It eats grasses, sedges, herbs, bamboo, as well as the leaves, fruits, flowers, bark, and young branches of woody shrubs and trees including palms. The young shoots of Alang-alang grass <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;are apparently a favoured food source (Hoogerwerf 1970). Lists of food plants are provided by Wharton (1957), Hoogerwerf (1970), Halder (1976), Sumardja and Kartawinata (1977), Djaja <em>et al</em>. (1982), Alikodra (1987), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993), and Hedges (in prep.). However, very little is known about the Banteng’s nutritional requirements, seasonal and annual variation in dietary preferences, or the composition and quality of diet. Hoogerwerf was of the opinion that Banteng was largely dependent on grasses and sedges and, with reference to Ujung Kulon in West Java, he stated that ‘there were no proofs that browse formed a substantial part of the diet’. However, Schenkel and Schenkel-Hulliger (1969) reported that Banteng and deer in Ujung Kulon are forced to travel widely in the dry season and ‘feed on bamboo, young palm leaves, bush, and saplings as well’. And the stomachs of a number of bulls which were shot in the South Tjiandur region of Java were almost completely full of non-graminaceous species. In Pananjung-Pangandaran Reserve in West Java Banteng were observed to graze on a variety of plants but appeared to prefer the grasses <em>Ischaemum muticum, Axonopus compressus, Paspalum conjugatum,</em> and <em>Cynodon dactylon</em>; and a woody forest shrub. Grazing intensity was lower in the forest than in the open fields where it was inversely proportional to the amount of <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>&#160;(= <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>) and <em>Imperata cylindrica&#160;</em>although they did eat these species (Sumardja and Kartawinata 1977). In Sabah, Banteng was found to forage on eight species found within open canopy sites: <em>Mikania cordata</em>,&#160;<em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>, <em>Cyperus difformis</em>, <em>Fibristylis littoralis</em>, <em>Scleria</em> sp,,&#160;<em>Dismodium triflorium</em>, <em>Eleusine indica</em>, and <em>Selaginella</em> sp.&#160;<br/> <br/>When undisturbed, Banteng displays a more or less fixed diurnal pattern of behaviour with periods (usually two to three hours long) of feeding alternating with rest periods of a similar length during which the animals ruminate. In areas which are subject to frequent human disturbance it becomes rather nocturnal and generally enters open areas only at night, although in especially attractive localities it will tolerate human presence to a certain extent (Halder 1976). In undisturbed areas Bantengs ‘do not differentiate much in their activities between day and night, but...really large assemblages on open plains occur almost exclusively by day...This round the clock activity (which is, however, interrupted countless times to rest and/or ruminate) may not be regarded as abnormal’ (Hoogerwerf 1970: 211-212).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-CA"">In undisturbed forest habitat in Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) Banteng activity peaks at dawn and during the early morning hours of 05:00-07:00 hours when the animals emerge from the forest to forage and socialize. Activity decreases mid-morning until early afternoon when they rest and ruminate and at dusk, a second peak in activity occurs during which they forage and socialize (Gardner 2015). Banteng activity decreases around 20:00-21:00 hours and again at 03:00-04:00; the reasons for this are unknown <span lang=""EN-CA"">(<span lang=""EN-CA"">Melletti and Burton 2014, Gardner, 2015)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. Analysis of 160 Banteng camera-trap encounters from the Cambodian Eastern Plains showed nocturnal activity with over 80% of encounters between 18:00 and 06:00 hours <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Gray and Phan 2011)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.<br/> <br/>The basic social group appears to be female–juvenile unit (as in the other large Asian Bovini) with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages. Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves occur; these groups can often contain one or more subadult and adult males. Groups of cows without calves are also seen. For much of the year (adult) Bantengs are largely sexually segregated and all-male groups are frequently encountered at this time. Solitary animals tend to be mature bulls or sometimes old cows. The composition of small groups of cows with calves or juveniles, and the solitary state of old individuals may remain the same for months or even years. The composition of other small groups, particularly the unisex groups, usually varies from day to day. During the mating season the male groups disband and dominant males compete for access to receptive females (Hoogerwerf 1970, Halder 1976, S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991-2002).&#160;In large open areas small herds of Banteng and solitary individuals regularly gather to form large temporary assemblages. These large herds will often spend up to two days together during which time they will forage and ruminate, socialize, and re-establish their hierarchy.</span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">Large herds of more than 100 animals have been reported in Java&#160;but these herds appear to be temporary associations formed when smaller groups and solitary animals arrive in an area to feed and the animals tend to reform into smaller groups when they leave the feeding areas. The composition of these groups often varies on a daily basis although there may be a stable nucleus of animals which returns to the same clearing day after day. The large herds may have an established dominance hierarchy but it seems to vary depending on the habitat. In more densely vegetated areas solitary animals or small groups, generally with fewer than eight animals, are more typical (Halder 1973, 1976; S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002). In the Eastern Plains Landscape, Cambodia, mean Banteng herd size (estimated from counting individuals in independent camera-trap encounters) was 2.6 individuals with 14% of encounters estimated to comprise groups of more than five individuals <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Phan and Gray 2010)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.<br/> <br/> In Thailand the mating season is in May and June (Lekagul and McNeely 1977); while breeding reportedly occurs the whole year round in Myanmar (Peacock 1933). Wharton (1957) collected information from Cambodians living within Banteng habitat which suggested that the majority of births occurred in December and January which, assuming a gestation period of about 10 months, suggests that most conceptions take place in March and April. However, Hermanns (cited in Hoogerwerf 1970) was of the opinion that Bantengs in mainland Asia mate from September to October. Hoogerwerf (1970) recorded mating taking place all year round in West Java but there was a peak of activity in October; and he thought that those cows which mated outside the peak period were probably exceptional. He was of the opinion that Bantengs in both East and West Java generally calved in July and August which would suggest that mating generally took place from October to December; more recent observations in East Java have also revealed evidence of year-round matings (neonates have been seen in all months) but with an apparent peak of births between June and September (S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002).</span></span></span></p>","The major threats to Banteng throughout its&#160;range are hunting and increasing loss of habitat (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Pudyatmoko 2004, Steinmetz 2004, S. Hedges unpub. data 1991–2002, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). In Viet Nam and Lao PDR where the rate of lowland forest loss is also accelerating habitat loss is primarily a concern for the future viability of national populations, the species having been hunted out of forests long before they are cleared. In Indochina generally, habitat loss and fragmentation are secondary to hunting, largely acting indirectly by increasing accessibility of remnant Banteng populations to hunting. In mainland South-east Asia hunting is the main direct threat and the species has been lost from much of its former range, even where suitable habitat remains (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Hunting is exacerbated especially in mainland South-east Asia by human repopulation of lowland forest areas and associated habitat fragmentation, that is, the very areas where most Bantengs occur (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although huge tracts of suitable habitat were lost in the twentieth century, and continue to be converted, this has probably occurred&#160;largely&#160;after Banteng was hunted out (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Thus, the hunting is the proximate cause of decline, but habitat loss is continually reducing the maximum population possible if hunting issues were to be controlled, and is increasing the ease with which remaining animals can be hunted. The recent granting of large-scale economic land concessions for industrial agriculture (particularly rubber plantations) is a significant threat to remaining lowland deciduous forest (and hence Banteng habitat) in northern and eastern Cambodia. Large areas of the species’ current Cambodian range (including inside protected areas) are threatened through land concessions (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013);&#160;however 2016 changes in the management of forests and protected areas by the Royal Government of Cambodia may have mitigated this threat to an extent (T. Gray in litt. 2016).&#160;The magnitude of the threat posed to Banteng by international trade in trophy horns is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, given the small size of the remaining Banteng population and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, during what were essentially opportunistic surveys, it is clearly a major threat on the Asian mainland (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al</em>. 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999; Timmins and Ou 2001). The threat posed by use of traditional medicinal substances derived from wild oxen is even harder to determine in the case of Banteng and essentially remains unknown, although it is thought to be a source of significant threat to Gaur (see 2008 Red List account). A growing regional economy has increased rather than decreased the demand for natural resources, Banteng amongst them, and the potential benefits of hunting Banteng with possibilities of significant market value in the form of wild meat, trophies and traditional medicines must make it a lucrative target.<br/>The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Protection Forest, Mondulkiri and O’Yadao Protected Forests Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Banteng remain actively&#160;targeted for hunting for meat and trophy antlers in Cambodia serving both domestic and regional, particularly Vietnamese, markets. For example in the first half of 2016 a minimum of six Banteng were known to be poached from&#160;Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (WWF in litt. 2016). Banteng meat is also regularly confiscated by enforcement agencies within Mondulkiri province and poaching, both targeted and as by-catch from snares, is a substantial threat to all Cambodian populations. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in three areas, the most significant issue concerning the area is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Siema Protection Forest (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Although conservation efforts for Banteng and many other species have been, in all three areas, extremely encouraging for some years as of 2016, they face an uncertain future with the possibility of de-gazettment of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff. Indeed since 2011 accelerating threats to all three protected areas, largely driven through commercial logging of high-value timber species, is causing widespread ungulate hunting (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013).&#160;<strong>&#160;</strong>In most cases the remaining Banteng populations are well isolated from cattle including the domestic oxen. In Cambodia, the Eastern plains population is still large and thus probably unlikely to be effected by rare introgression events.&#160;In Thailand one population of Banteng in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary suffered declines in past years and, as a result, experienced a population genetic bottle-neck (N. Bhampakphan pers. comm. 2013); the loss of genetic diversity potentially increases the susceptibility of deleterious genetic defects and risk of disease in the future. Genetic introgression from non-native Banteng is a threat; Banteng sampled from the western and eastern regions of Thailand identified eight haplotypes using the cytochrome b gene and control region (1079 bp). The highest diversity (six haplotypes) was found in Huai Kha Khaend Wildlife Sanctuary however two haplotypes (seven individuals) from Lam Pao Dam, Kalasin province, were classified as Javan Banteng <em>Bos javanicus javanicus </em>(W. Wajjwalku and W. Klinsawat pers. comm. 2013).&#160;In addition to the genetic threat, domestic livestock are a potential source of diseases and parasites. This can have very serious consequences for Banteng which appears to be particularly susceptible to a number of cattle diseases; for example, Banteng populations in Myanmar have in the past been very badly affected by diseases from domestic cattle (Hundley cited in Wharton 1968).<br/><br/>In Sabah habitat loss to permanent agriculture is a serious and ongoing threat (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). In areas of Sabah where habitat loss is not absolute, the Banteng seeks refuge in dense forest patches generally found at higher elevations because they are unsuitable for harvesting and agriculture (P. Gardner pers. obs). Disturbance from agriculture and logging intervals in commercially managed forest also causes displacement and stress, potentially influencing breeding of Banteng (P. Gardner pers. obs). Hunting is equally significant and the species has been rapidly exterminated from many areas (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Ahmad AH pers. comm. 2008). Rampant hunting in Sabah now targets remnant herds, removing mature breeding individuals important for sustaining herds (P. Gardner pers. obs).&#160;On Java some populations are potentially threatened by heavy predation from Dhole&#160;<em>Cuon alphinus</em> (Hedges and Tyson 1996, Pudyatmoko 2004). All populations are also threatened by poaching and some, perhaps most, are threatened by habitat loss and degradation (S. Hedges unpub. data 1991–2002). During the 1980s–1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Banteng in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree <em>Acacia nilotica</em> (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park’s monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that contain little or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the cattle to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camar</em><em>a</em> (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Banteng habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Bali cattle have long been interbred with other cattle: Banteng and Bali cattle can interbreed with both common cattle and Mithan <em>Bos frontalis&#160;</em>(Fischer 1980, National Research Council 1983). Hybrids between Banteng and common cattle <em>Bos taurus</em>&#160;of the zebu type are fully fertile; in hybrids between Banteng and <em>Bos taurus</em> of the European type the males are sterile (Jellinek <em>et al</em>. 1980, National Research Council 1983). Domestic and feral livestock are thus a potential threat to the genetic integrity of wild Banteng populations and a number of reports suggest that wild Banteng does interbreed with domestic cattle. For example, Hoogerwerf (1970) referred to several sources from the 1930s and 1940s which mention that many groups of Banteng in Kalimantan (particularly East Kalimantan) were no longer pure-bred having interbred with stray domestic cattle. Wharton (1957) also found evidence of interbreeding with domestic cattle in Cambodia; and reports from Myanmar mention that Bantengs feed alongside village cattle and occasionally interbreed with them (Tun Yin 1967, Salter 1983).&#160;<br/><br/>Hunting for Banteng trophy heads continues to threaten the population in Sabah and Kalimantan. Reports suggest an international trade in trophy heads originating from Kalimantan and sold across the Sabah border however first-hand accounts have yet to be substantiated. The majority of trophy heads and horns encountered in 2012 and 2013 were found in wildlife displays by government departments. Encounters of trophy heads are made in rural villages but are generally infrequent because&#160;of&#160;the fear of reprisal by wildlife authorities but also the demand for horns for use in soups.<br/><br/>Introgression with domestic cattle is not believed to be a current threat to Banteng in Sabah but genetic studies are in their infancy. Poor management of domestic cattle has the potential to cause introgression; one old report suggested a feral Bali cow or a Banteng/Bali cow hybrid with (white spotted) pelage was hunted within the south-west of Sabah. A separate report suggested domestic cattle were left in abandoned logging camps in Deramakot Forest Reserve at some point in the past three decades and may have interbred with wild Banteng. In the majority of locations that utilize domestic cattle their security is maintained with fenced enclosures. Water Buffaloes are frequently used in the harvesting of oil palm fruit, and are frequently grazed along forest boundaries. In 2012 in east Sabah, Water Buffaloes were found approximately 200 m from wild Banteng. &#160;The genetic integrity of Banteng is of primary concern in Sabah, where fragmentation and isolation of populations now prevents movement of individuals and the transmission of genes between populations. The removal of mature individuals by illegal hunting will disrupt breeding behaviour and the social structure of the herds, in addition to the direct loss of genetic diversity. Small and isolated populations are susceptible to inbreeding, which will undoubtedly lead to a loss of allelic diversity and increase the risk of identical genotypes. Genetic homogeneity in the Banteng will decrease their overall fitness, and their ability to resist diseases and deleterious genetic mutations. Active genetic management of wild Banteng stock in Sabah is most likely to be the only way to prevent loss of genetic diversity and the imminent threat of extinction.","<p><span lang=""EN-CA""></p><p>The world population of Banteng is likely to be approximately 8,000 individuals of which approximately 4,600 occur in a single subpopulation in eastern Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2012. 2016). Outside eastern Cambodia only 6-8 subpopulations of more than 50 animals, are known, with 4–5 on Java, 1–2 in Thailand (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000, Pudyatmoko 2004), and possibly one in Sabah (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). A once fairly widely distributed species, it is now largely reduced to small isolated populations, most of which are still in decline.</p><p>In Cambodia, Banteng probably declined by 90% or more between the late 1960s and the early 1990s. At this latter time it still remained widespread, although in generally low numbers, in the lowland forests of the north and east, and also, probably somewhat more sporadically, in the south and west including the Cardamom Mountain range (Heng Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998,&#160;Daltry and Momberg 2000,&#160;Timmins and Ou 2001, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). From at least this time onwards the most substantial Banteng population has been centred on Mondulkiri province where in the late 1990s it was at the time thought that at least several hundred to a perhaps over a thousand Banteng survived in a forested landscape of over 15,000 km² (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). This was clearly a considerable underestimate as recent systematic surveys have estimated the population to be much larger (see below). Further declines took place from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s, with quite probably more than a 50% decline in this time period for the nation as a whole, and the resultant loss of Banteng populations from significant parts of the still forested landscape (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003, Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensive distance-based line transects conducted between 2009 and 2011 across 3,400 km² of the core areas of Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary estimated a Banteng population of 3,200 individuals (95% CI range 1,980-5,170) <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Gray <em>et al</em>. 2012)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.&#160;This was higher than previously believed; the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment suggesting no subpopulation globally exceeded 500 individuals (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). Repeat surveys during the 2013/14 dry-season of the cores of Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary suggested the Banteng population in these areas was stable in comparison with 2009/2011 data: between 600 and 1,600 individuals in the core of Mondulkiri Protected Forest (analogous to Mondulkiri Protected Forest inner core in Gray <em>et al</em>. 2012) and 830 – 3,200 in the core of Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2016). Given the presence in the adjacent Seima Protection Forest (500 individuals based on 2014 line-transect density estimates; M. Maltby in litt. 2015) and outside the core of Mondulkiri Protected Forest the landscape population is probably around 4,600 individuals. However accelerating threats (particularly habitat loss and hunting; see Threats) mean this population is likely to be experiencing an ongoing decline having possibly recovered during the early 2000s following the initiation of law enforcement activities (T. Gray in litt. 2016).&#160;Elsewhere in Cambodia clearance and fragmentation of the once vast lowland forests has accelerated in the last half decade, largely due to the development of agro-industry concessions, as well as the proliferation of piecemeal small-holder farms and other land claims, and this has probably lead to extirpation (due to hunting) from a significant part of the species' former Cambodian range.</span></p><p>The other present-day stronghold of Banteng is Java, where six large subpopulations (those with more than 50 animals) occurred in 1990, but these declined to only 4–5 by 2004 (Pudyatmoko 2004). Pudyatmoko (2004) estimated: Ujung Kulon National Park (300–800 individuals in 2003), Cikepuh-Cibanteng Nature Reserve (25–65 individuals in 2003), Bonjonglarang-Jayanti Region (a small stable population of unknown size in 1988, with no recent data available), Cimapag Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Leuweng Sancang Nature Reserve (10 individuals in 2000, extinct in 2003), Cikamurang Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Pangandaran Nature Reserve (25–65 individuals in 2003), Kediri Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Coast of Blitar (10 individuals in 1988, with current status unknown), Coast of Malang (six individuals in 1988, with current status unknown), Meru Betiri National Park (200 individuals in 2000, with at least 57 individuals in 2002), Alas Purwo National Park (with at least 80 individuals in 2002), and Baluran National Park (around 206 individuals in 2002). Numbers in all areas are declining (Hedges and Tyson 1996, S. Hedges unpub. data. 1991–2002, Pudyatmoko 2004).</p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""> Population numbers and even trends are difficult to quantify for the island of Borneo but there have been declines, especially in Kalimantan (S. Pudyatmoko pers. comm. 2006, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006), and in Sabah (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). The Bornean population is thought to have been particularly negatively affected by interbreeding with domestic and/or feral oxen of types other than pure-bred ‘Bali Cattle’.&#160;</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Up until at least the early twentieth&#160;Century, Banteng was still found throughout what is now Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), albeit disappearing in some areas (in particular, in South Kalimantan) (Gardner <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). <a>By the early 2000s</a>, Banteng was thought to be widespread but rare in East Kalimantan, on the basis of recent (mid- and late-1990s) reports from many areas, including Kayan Mentarang National Park (NP), and within or close to Hutan Kapur Sangkulirang (an unprotected area that has been proposed for protection since the early 1980s) (Hedges and Meijaard 1999,&#160;E. Meijaard unpubl. data).&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">Banteng persists in East Kalimantan in Kutai National Park; camera trap images confirmed breeding (a female calf approximately 4-5 months old and a bull approx. 3-4 years old) however the population size is thought to be very small, given the lack of recent observations compared with survey effort (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013). The species might also persist in&#160;<a>Hutan Kapur Sangkulirang Nature Reserve</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">, although no recent reports have been confirmed.&#160;A small population was reported from Belantikan Hulu in Central Kalimantan in November 2007 (tracks found) and April 2008 (local reports of capture of cow and calf); the population is believed to be small (T. Simorangkir pers. comm. 2008). This population was reconfirmed in 2013 from camera trap images of a bull and cow but its size remains unknown (Yayorin pers. comm. 2013).&#160;</span></span></p><p>Banteng also occurs along the border with Sarawak in East Kalimantan in Kayan Mentarang (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2013); in 1999 observations were made of a solitary young bull and a small herd of four individuals (including cows), in addition to tracks and dung signs&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">(Hedges and Meijaard 1999)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. There are concerns over the genetic integrity of Banteng in this area because of the presence of domestic cattle, abandoned in 1979 by villagers, which might have interbred with the wild Banteng&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">(Hedges and Meijaard 1999)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.</span></span></p><p>In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) Banteng was probably largely restricted to the alluvial plains of the coastal belt (Wharton 1968). Low (1848, cited by Wharton 1968) reported that the Banteng in Sarawak lived chiefly in the bamboo forests along the Sangow and Baram Rivers, where according to Banks (1931) domestic Banteng was kept by the Kalabit people (thus raising the possibility that the Banteng populations in Sarawak and neighbouring parts of Kalimantan may be partly feral in origin, or contain hybrid animals) (P. Gardner <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). Beccari (1904) indicated that the species was not scarce but kept mainly to areas of secondary growth in the interior. Banks (1931) reported that Banteng did not occur south of the Baleh River (a tributary of the Rejang River) in Sarawak, and was found in the headwaters of most rivers to the north of this. He further mentioned the Niah District where Banteng was relatively common, Merapok in the Lawas district, Ulu Trusan, Limbang, various places in the Baram, above Tubau in the Ulu Bintulu, at Belaga and down to the head of the Pelagus rapids, but not into the neighbouring Mukah and Oya Rivers. In the 1950s, Banteng was still common around the Niah Caves but ‘this is one of the few places where it is so in Borneo today’ (Harrisson 1961), and by 1967 few Bantengs were thought to be left in Sarawak (Anderson, pers. comm. to Wharton 1968). In the early 1980s, Banteng apparently persisted in the more remote parts of north and east Sarawak (Aken and Kavanagh 1982), but Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) stated that there had been no recent reports [although Labang (1987 cited by Caldecott, 1988) reportedly found evidence of their continued presence]. However, few, if any Bantengs persist in Sarawak as of 2016, although they may cross into Sarawak from neighbouring Kalimantan, where they were known to occur in the large Kayan Mentarang NP at least until the late 1990s (Hedges and Meijaard 1999).</p><p>The population in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) is in decline primarily because of continual loss of habitat, human disturbance causing displacement, and rampant hunting (P. Gardner pers. obs). Quantifying accurate population sizes are problematic and continue to be confounded by a range of issues including the inhospitable habitat, the shy nature of the species, and detection and quantification of the species. Prior to the 1940s, Banteng was reported to be common in riverine areas in the east, and in many areas of shifting cultivation. However, the subsequent widespread use of firearms led to the species's rapid extermination from most areas. In 1982, it was reported to be locally common in logged forest on flat terrain, but under threat as its habitat was converted into permanent agricultural land (Davies and Payne 1982).&#160;</p><p>The state-wide population estimate in 1982 was 300-550 individuals <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Davies and Payne 1982)<span lang=""EN-CA""> but this was based on community surveys in accessible locations and did not include all Banteng populations. The biggest population decline occurred during the intensive and extensive timber operation and transformation of lowland forests large-scale plantations (palm oil, cocoa and other crops) late in the twentieth century (Ahmad AH pers. comm. 2008). During this period (years 1970-2000) of intensification,&#160;the decline in Banteng was thought to be over 50% in Sabah and Borneo as a whole&#160;(B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;In 1990, Banteng still occurred south of Gunung Lumaku (in the upper reaches of the Padas River) but it had been extirpated from all other parts of south-western Sabah according to local people (Payne 1990).</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">Since this time, new road infrastructure has opened up the interior of Sabah and vast land-use changes continue to remove much of the natural forest habitat. Encroachment and hunting has undoubtedly increased over the past four decades as a result of habitat conversion and extensive networks of logging roads. Some populations are known to have been eradicated in the past three decades, and the current population size is very likely to be less than 350 individuals.&#160;Introgression with domestic cattle has not been observed in five forests containing Banteng, surveyed over the past three years, although reports suggested domestic cattle were abandoned at logging camps and interbred with wild Banteng in Dermakot Forest Reserve. The potential for disease transmission from domestic livestock is unquestionable as Banteng is found in close proximity to water buffalo and cows in forest habitat located adjacent to plantations and private land. As of 2016, rampant hunting continues to deplete remnant populations (P. Gardner pers. obs). The security of Banteng is further compromised in locations where the animals move between protected forest and timber plantations, privately-owned forest and grassland to search for forage (P. Gardner pers. obs). In one area, Bantengs are encouraged into privately owned grassland managed for recreational sport hunting (P. Gardner pers. obs). Otherwise, populations in Sabah are now confined to remote forest and swamp habitat which are highly fragmented; the prevention of gene-flow between fragmented populations may compromise the genetic-integrity of future generations. Timber plantations are not considered to be a main habitat of Banteng due to the temporary status of the forest and the regular eradication of the vegetation which forces the Banteng into nearby natural forest. Between 2009 and 2015, remnant subpopulations were confirmed on the east coast in Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, and Tabin Wildlife Reserve (approximately 52 individuals). In the central and southern reserves including Dermakot Forest Reserve, Tangkulap Forest Reserve, Segaluid Forest Reserve, Malua Forest Reserve (approximately 35 individuals), Ulu-Segama Malua Forest Reserve, Danum Valley Conservation Area, and Maliau Basin Conservation Area [over 10 individuals]&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">(Melletti and Burton 2014)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. On the south west coast there is a small population (size unknown) in Sipitang Forest Reserve, and Banteng was recently confirmed as present in Sapulut Forest Reserve. Unconfirmed populations may also persist on the west, north and north-east coast of Sabah. Subpopulations thought to have gone extinct since <span lang=""EN-CA"">1982<span lang=""EN-CA"">&#160;include herds in the Dent peninsular, Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary and Kinabatangan district, Beaufort district, Keningau district, and Kudat and Murudu Bay. At least four populations successfully bred in years 2009-2013 (P. Gardner pers. obs) but during this time, hunting simultaneously removed mature individuals.</span></span></span></p><p>In Thailand, the only subpopulations with more than 50 animals are Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and perhaps Kaeng Krachan National Park. In Kaeng Krachan National Park the density of Banteng is thought to be low; the situation has not significantly improved and there is no obvious hope for recovery of the population (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013). Smaller numbers do or may persist in Mae Ping National Park, Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, Thap Lan National Park, Khao Ang Ruenai Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Sok National Park, Kui Buri National Park (approx. 3 individuals remain) and Pang Sida National Park (signs of a small herd) (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2013). Banteng are also found in the Western Forest Complex but continue to face serious fragmentation and poaching for meat and parts (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013). Recovery of this population is still considered very limited and is only applicable to areas where habitat remains and where there is good protection (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013). Banteng range probably declined by approximately 85% in Thailand from 1980 to 2000 (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000). The Banteng population in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (one of few &gt;50) did not increase during years 2006-2008 (per R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008) however it persists as of 2013&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">(N. Bhampakhan pers. comm. 2013). Banteng is one of the significant ecosystem engineers wi<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">thin this fire-prone landscape but is threatened by a lack of forage as a result of post-fire regeneration of highly invasive evergreen species which smoother the ground and prevent the growth of important grasses (N. Bhampakphan pers. comm. 2013). A population in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary in the east of Thailand is reported to be increasing from a population genetic bottle-neck (N. Bhampakhan pers. comm. 2013). The Thai Banteng populations outside Huai Kha Khaeng and Khao Ang Rue Nai however are not increasing and for this reason it is imperative to maintain the status of Banteng within the protected reserves&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">(N.

Evidence of Banteng was found for a number of areas in the 1990s (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Steinmetz 2004), but there has been very little survey effort since 1998. Confirmation of presence after the mid-1990s, when populations were in steep decline (Duckworth and Hedges 1998), is lacking. Most areas have received little if any protection: so it is quite likely that Banteng has been hunted out from several, perhaps most, conceivably all, of them (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most likely areas for continued presence are in the southern half of the country; it is possible that no populations greater than 10 individuals remain (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013), and populations of conservation significance are only conceivable in perhaps two to three areas, two of which lie along the international border with Cambodia (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario is likely in Viet Nam, although persistence is more likely (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). Pedrono <em>et al</em>. <span lang=""EN-CA"">(2009)<span lang=""EN-CA""> estimated the overall population, in five contiguous<span lang=""EN-CA""> areas in the Eastern Highlands, as between 74 and 103 individuals; the largest populations were in Yok Don National Park (30-44 individuals) and Ea So Nature Reserve (23-31 individuals). Reports however suggest that management conditions and illegal activities may have led to declines in the relatively high profile Yok Don NP, leaving in question the status of the species in lower profile areas (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008).</span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Little recent information has been traced from Myanmar: a national camera-trapping survey aimed at the Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>, which will not necessarily have covered all, or even the best, areas for Banteng, recorded it in and around Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park, Mahamyaing Reserve Forest, and the central Bago (Pegu) Yoma (Lynam 2003). Current numbers are unknown but are sure to be declining, given general trends in ungulates in better-studied parts of the country. There are no quantitative data available on numbers remaining in China, but there are, if any, at most very few.</p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""> A domesticated form of Banteng, often called ‘Bali Cattle’, and considered to be the same species (contrasting with general taxonomic treatment for several other oxen) occurs widely in Indonesia and has been introduced to other areas of the world. However, few if any populations of this form are now likely to be pure-bred, because of interbreeding with domestic oxen derived from other <em>Bos</em> species (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006). One population of approximately 6,000 animals, which appears now to be superficially indistinguishable from wild Banteng, thrives in Garig Gunak Barlu National Park, on the Cobourg Peninsula in Northern Territory, Australia. These animals derive from approximately 20 domesticated ‘Banteng’ taken from Denpasar, Bali in 1849, and they have recently been shown to be genetically indistinguishable from wild Banteng, at least to the extent of the molecular sequences analysed. This suggests that they have not been cross-bred previously to any significant extent with other domestic cattle (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006). Some domestic oxen lineages in mainland South-east Asia, for instance in Cambodia, may have at least partial Banteng ancestry (e.g. Timmins and Ou 2001).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">The species historically occurred from southern China (Yunnan) and, probably, northeast India throughout mainland southeast Asia, through Peninsular Malaysia to the islands of Borneo, Java, and probably Bali (see below).&#160;</p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">No fossil evidence is known from Bali, and Grubb (2005) stated that Banteng was introduced to the island; Corbet and Hill (1992) did not include Bali in the range of wild Banteng and various other sources simply state that it occurs as domestic animals. Nevertheless, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that Banteng should be included among the native fauna of Bali since several Indo-Malayan animal species are known to have penetrated eastwards as far as Flores and Timor during times of lowered sea-levels in the Pleistocene (Hooijer 1975). On Borneo (East Kalimantan, Indonesia), ancient cave art (circa 10,000 BP) depicting a bovid figure, thought to be <em>Bos javanicus</em>, was found in 1994 <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Chazine 2005)<span lang=""EN-CA"">, which suggests the natural range of Banteng extended up until Wallace’s line. Ashby and Santiapillai (1988) treated the small number of free-living Bantengs which in occur in west Bali as wild animals as did Watling (1991); although Watling noted that interbreeding with domestic Bali cattle is a problem and the population is unlikely to consist solely of pure-bred animals. Wind and Amir (1977) had earlier raised similar fears.<span lang=""EN-CA""></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Domestic Banteng has been introduced to several of the islands of eastern Indonesia including Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba (van der Maarel 1932, Rollinson 1984). Feral Banteng occurs in Kalimantan (National Research Council 1983). Introduced Banteng (probably feral animals) occur on the Indonesian islands of Enggano (off Sumatra) and Sangihe (off Sulawesi) (Corbet and Hill 1992, Grubb 2005). Domestic Banteng has also been introduced to New Guinea and Australia and there are now large feral herds in the Northern Territory (Kirby 1979, Bowman 1993, Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> Wild Banteng currently occurs on Java and possibly Bali, in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo], Sabah [part of Malaysian Borneo], Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and, probably,&#160;Lao PDR and Viet Nam.&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">It is likely that the small remaining Banteng population in Sarawak [Malaysian Borneo] reported in 1988 (D. Labang, cited in Caldecott 1988) is now extinct. Banteng is also thought to be extinct in Brunei [Borneo] (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985),&#160;Bangladesh (Gittins and Akonda 1982,&#160;Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>.&#160;2008), and in India (Prater 1971, IUCN 1978), if it ever occurred there: Groves (2003) stated that “there have been constant reports from Manipur, but there is as yet no confirmation”. In West Malaysia it has probably been extinct since at least the 1950s (Hislop 1961). Medway (1983) thought that Banteng may have still occurred in parts of Kedah and Kelantan after that time, but there have been no recent records. In China, Banteng has been reported to occur in one area of southeast Yunnan, around Tongbiguan Nature Reserve, along the border with Myanmar; however, the evidence for this is unclear; and presence in China should be considered tentative at best.</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""> One of the largest and most important populations of Banteng remains in the west of Thailand in the protected Wildlife Sanctuary Huay Kha Khaeng (R. Steinmetz and N. Bhumpakphan pers. comm. 2013), with tiny remnant populations in Kui Buri National Park in the southern province close to the Myanmar border and in the east in Pangsida National Park (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2013). Small populations also persist in protected forest within the east including Pangsida National Park, Ta Phraya National Park and Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary with a larger population in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary (N. Bhumpakphan pers. comm. 2013). In Cambodia a substantial population remains in the east, within protected areas of Mondulkiri Province (see Population) <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Gray <em>et al</em>.&#160;2012)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. The species was until very recently likely to have been widespread in the northern and eastern forests as well as parts of the Cardamom Mountain range, but with the onset of rampant agroforestry enterprises and other forms of land-grabbing concessions occupied Cambodian range is likely to have significantly decreased in the last half decade. The bulk of the Cambodian population remains in protected areas in the eastern forests, centred on Mondulkiri province (see Population).&#160;</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">On Borneo, the species occurs in isolated parts of Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) along the east coast including Tabin Wildlife Reserve, in the central and southern forest reserves including Malua Forest Reserve and Maliau Basin Conservation Area, and in secluded patches in the south west of Sabah close to the Kalimantan/Sarawak border. Reports of Banteng along the north and north east coast of Sabah suggest small populations persist in highly fragmented habitat although these are yet to be confirmed. In Kalimantan (Indonesia Borneo), it occurs along the border with Sarawak (Malaysia) in East Kalimantan in Kayan Mentarang (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2013), Kutai National Park (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013)<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">, and in Central Kalimantan in Hulu Belantikan (Yayorin pers. comm. 2013).

Newspaper reports of Banteng hunting in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) are infrequent and usually arise from tip-offs to the government departments, the true number of successful Banteng hunts are known to be much higher however, due to the number of reports obtained from locals and timber contractors, the high frequency of photographic captures of hunters, and the reports of intimidation of forest rangers by military personnel and officials conducting sport hunting within protected forests. Occasionally Banteng horns can be found at local markets in Sabah and their use is thought to be for soups (to increase general vitality) and as a tool to rub or scratch the skin (the latter may have been a misleading interpretation however).&#160;<br/>There are a number of captive animals within zoos and other menageries, but these constitute an insignificant offtake in recent years from wild populations.<br/>There is a domesticated form of Banteng, but its uses supply needs/markets independent of those supplied by wild caught animals.&#160;Uses of the domesticated form of Banteng are not considered here, nor are the uses of feral Australian populations.",Terrestrial,"This species is legally protected in all range states. A proposal for inclusion into CITES Appendix 1 was submitted (Hedges 1996) however there have been no developments and the species is not currently listed.<br/><br/>The most significant known Banteng populations remaining are in Java, Cambodia and perhaps Thailand and Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), and it is in these countries and around these populations that conservation efforts should be focused.<br/><br/>Banteng is mainly confined to protected areas throughout southeast Asia (see Population), with the probable exception of Cambodia. Banteng presence in Lao protected areas is currently uncertain but there are at least 10 large forested protected areas in the south which might still support the species as well as three to four areas further north, but any populations are certainly not large. In Viet Nam, the species probably now occurs in only a few protected areas (see Population). In Myanmar, Banteng can be found in protected national parks and forest reserves.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In Cambodia, most of the large forested protected areas, of which there are more than 15, are likely to retain at least residual Banteng populations. Unfortunately, in most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia which still retain Banteng, protected status offers little if any protection to the species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Exceptions are Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area in Cambodia; and there are now even signs of population recovery in these areas (WCS unpublished data; WWF unpublished data). The immediate conservation needs for the large Mondulkiri-centred Cambodian population are to continue strengthening site-based conservation management, in particular of the&#160;Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and&#160;and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, and laying the necessary groundwork to ensure that such management can be continued indefinitely.<br/><br/>Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting longstanding high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""game reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other off-take, but the national parks of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Banteng and, at least into the mid 1990s, large populations) remained remarkably close to intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some smaller mammals, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Banteng and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the people's resources and would therefore benefit from decentralized management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ‘tragedy of the commons’, has indeed led to increased destruction and poaching in the past decade. Banteng, as a large ungulate, is particularly threatened by this rapid rise in illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008) and also by expansion of agriculture on Java and other forms of encroachment (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008.). The decentralization of conservation management decisions and actions, macro-economic fluctuations and reduced authority of the law impedes control of illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The Indonesian government has produced a National Strategy and Action Plan for Banteng in 2012 (Pudyatmoko <em>et al</em>. 2012), which it is hoped will raise awareness of their continuing decline and focus conservation efforts on the most important populations.<br/><br/>In Thailand there are two populations thought to contain over 50 individuals, in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Kaeng Krachan National Park. Both areas are under active conservation management.&#160;<br/><br/>In Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), sub-populations are becoming fragmented, which is therefore limiting the potential for gene-flow, because of large-scale agricultural plantations, newly-developing prawn farms (in north Sabah), and commercial timber plantations. Because of&#160;the difficulties in regulating widespread illegal hunting of Banteng across the state, captive breeding using wild-caught individuals is probably the best method to conserve the remnant genetic diversity and increase numbers for future reintroduction. &#160;<br/><br/>A large feral population of Banteng exists in the northern territories of Australia however this is thought to be derived from Bali cattle (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006). There is a captive population of Banteng held by various zoos including: Edinburgh Zoo (Scotland, U.K)&#160;(1 bull and 1 cow:&#160;<em>Bos javanicus javanicus</em>), (herd size and subspecies unknown), Chester Zoo (England, U.K),&#160;Saint Louis Zoo (Missouri, U.S.A), Montgomery Zoo (Alabama, U.S.A),&#160;Taronga Western Plains Zoo (New South Wales, Australia),&#160;Malacca Zoo (Peninsula Malaysia), and Lok Kawi Wildlife Park (Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malayisa Borneo).

The last published records of Kouprey were from: Pfeffer (1974<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>in litt</em>. to IUCN/CMC); 1964-1970 period by Pfeffer, when photos were taken, (Pfeffer and Ou Kim-San 1967, Pfeffer 1969); 1969 by J. Mellon who saw two female Koupreys in the Chhep/Melouprey area of Cambodia (J. Mellon<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>in litt</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;to D. Ashwell 1993); and 1963/64 by C. Wharton (Wharton 1966). More recent reports have not been confirmed. An assessment of 90% of camera trap photos from the region including the potential range of the Kouprey was made in 2011; this showed no camera trap images of Kouprey. This shows a period of more than 40 years without confirmed recordings.&#160;Extensive survey work has now documented where significant wild cattle populations remain within the historical range of Kouprey, and in no area other than eastern Cambodia are wild cattle numbers high. In most areas wild cattle numbers are so low that it is no longer conceivable that Kouprey could survive. This is compounded by the observation that Kouprey naturally occurred at lower densities compared with Banteng, and the habitat specificity of Kouprey and its exceptional value in trade.&#160;If a case were to be made for the continued existence of Kouprey it would focus on the fact that none of the landscapes assessed were sufficiently surveyed to rule out the presence of Kouprey because of the scale of effort required, which will be the case for the foreseeable future. Specifically, two sets of camera-trap photos from potentially important areas of eastern Cambodia were not examined.</span></p><p></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>However, the species is most likely to be extinct. At most, there could only be a few individuals remaining, certainly many fewer than 250 mature individuals, and almost certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. The high level of hunting in the region has led to a significant decline, suspected at over 80% in the last 30 years (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), with a continued decline in any remaining subpopulations, if in fact it is not already extinct.</p>","Little is known of its biology and ecology, the only significant work being that of Wharton (1957). The species travels in small herds, primarily of females and calves, of up to 20 animals, which commonly associate with Banteng. Mature males form bachelor herds. The Kouprey is reported to have a diet of grasses, sedges, and some browse (Wharton 1957).<br/><br/>The Kouprey was primarily an animal of open deciduous dipterocarp forests, especially those areas with extensive grasslands. Although deciduous dipterocarp forests are extensive in Cambodia, and also in parts of adjoining countries (especially Lao PDR and Viet Nam), the preferred sites of Kouprey are much more localised, and perhaps account for less than 30% of the total area of the lowland mosaic forests dominated by deciduous dipterocarp forest (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, AWCSG 2011). The species appeared to use patches of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest which also occur in such landscapes. Most of the Kouprey's range lies in a highly seasonal area receiving less than 2,000 mm of precipitation per annum. The terrain in this area is generally flat or undulating lowlands. The presence of pools and mineral licks was certainly important.","Hunting, both for local consumption and for trade (meat and body parts, especially horns and skulls), is (or, if the species is extinct, was) the major threat throughout the Kouprey's range (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005). This trade value pre-dates the meteoric rise in volume and financial value of wildlife trade out of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia during the 1990s and 2000s. Salter&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) found three sets of male and two sets of female Kouprey horns (all reportedly from Cambodia) in a village in southern Champasak Province (southern Lao PDR). The male horns were valued by the owner at USD 4,000 and the female horns at USD 1,600 per set. During a trip to Amphoe Muang (Mukdahan Province, Thailand, on the border with Lao) on 29 March 1991, Kouprey parts were found to be available at one vendor. Horns were not on display but customers could examine photographs in an album: female Kouprey horns were offered at USD 6,000-8,000 per pair and male horns at USD 2,000 per pair. The male horns were polished so that the shredded ends could not be seen. During a second visit (in July 1991) the same vendor's stall was less active and no Kouprey trophies were on offer (although Gaur and Banteng could still be ordered). Wild cattle trophies were on offer at other vendors but no Kouprey horns or skulls were for sale at these stalls (Srikosamatara&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992). During a visit to Ban Mai (Thai/Lao border) by Srikosamatara and his colleagues in April 1993 a vendor of wildlife products claimed to have sold a pair of Kouprey horns to a Thai buyer for USD 800 two years before. He also claimed to have two more sets of Kouprey horns (both old males) for sale at USD 2,800 and USD 12,000 respectively. Three months later (July 1993) another survey (by I. Baird) found no Kouprey trophies for sale at the same vendors (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994). Bounties for Kouprey trophy horns were still believed to circulate in SE Asia as of 2010 (AWCSG 2011).<br/><br/>Diseases from domestic and/or free-ranging livestock could have disastrous consequences given the already severely reduced Kouprey population. Habitat loss as a result of the rapidly increasing land clearance for cultivation (local and commercial), mining and logging, as well as increasing levels of other human disturbances, are also threats, but are insignificant compared with hunting (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, see also 2008 account for Banteng). Many wildlife species of high monetary value still remain widespread and, relative to neighbouring countries, abundant in the extensive lowland forests of Cambodia, and with the fall of the Khmer Rouge and a rapidly growing free market economy there has been a surge of hunting to supply bushmeat, trophy antler/horn and medicinal markets, which is leading in many cases to very rapid declines in large quarry species (e.g. macaques have declined in some areas by over 90% in as little as five years; Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), thus, however, rare Kouprey becomes it will continually be at risk because, unlike in a single-quarry species system where at certain levels it becomes uneconomic to seek out the last few individuals, hunting levels will remain high, fuelled by returns from the more common species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Wild Oxen in Cambodia are now low in number and in most areas now rare or already hunted out (see IUCN Red List accounts for Banteng, Gaur and Wild Water Buffalo). Knowledge of the Kouprey is widespread among rural people in Cambodia, concerning its rarity and the value of trophies and perhaps other body parts; as such it is a more desirable target than most in Cambodia.","At an international workshop, held in Viet Nam in January 1988, reports were presented which suggested that there were about 27 Koupreys in Viet Nam, possibly 40-100 in the Lao PDR, and up to 200 in Cambodia, with perhaps a seasonal presence of a few animals in Thailand. These figures, which were little more than guesses, suggested that a total of about 100-300 Koupreys still existed in the late1980s. Unfortunately, it now seems that these figures were too optimistic, especially for Lao and Viet Nam where surveys in the 1990s were unable to document even large significant populations of other species of wild oxen (Cox <em>et al. </em>1991, 1992; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al. </em>1997; Duckworth and Hedges 1998; Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000; Cox <em>et al</em>. 1991, 1992; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers of wild oxen were, however, much higher in Cambodia, even though, within the vast extents of habitat, their densities were already low as documented during an aerial survey of a large part of eastern Cambodia in 1994 (Olivier and Woodford 1994).<br/><br/>The last published records of Koupreys are those of C. Wharton, who lead an expedition to capture Koupreys in 1963/64 (Wharton 1966). In 1969, J. Mellon saw two female Koupreys in the Chhep/Melouprey area of Cambodia, and in 1993 he was of the opinion that there might still be Koupreys in the area (J. Mellon <em>in litt</em> to D. Ashwell 1993). Later reports were also received by Pfeffer (1974 <em>in litt</em>. to IUCN/CMC). In the 1964-1970 period, Pfeffer undertook five expeditions to Indochina (each three months long) during which he collected information about kouprey and ""took the only reasonable photograph of a wild kouprey"" (Kemf 1988, Pfeffer and Ou Kim-San 1967, Pfeffer 1969). None of the evidence for Koupreys since Mellon's time, based on second-hand reports, hearsay, equivocal track identification or trophy horns (found in villages or wildlife markets and which could plausibly date back to Wharton's era) (e.g. MacKinnon and Stuart 1989, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003), has been particularly convincing in suggesting that viable populations of Koupreys remain; rather it suggests that a very rapid demise occurred. Wharton (1957) observed Koupreys to occur, even in what was considered optimal habitat, in lower numbers than Banteng&#160;<em>Bos javanicus</em> (his figures and other observations suggest a ratio of somewhere between 1:2 and 1:10), and suggested that, because of their restricted range and habitat specificity, Kouprey was at elevated risk of extinction compared with the other wild cattle.&#160;<br/><br/>Extensive survey work has now documented where significant wild cattle populations remain within the historical range of Kouprey, and in no area other than eastern Cambodia are wild cattle numbers high (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011). In most areas wild cattle numbers are so low (low dozens of individuals scattered through hundreds of square kilometres of habitat) that it is no longer conceivable that Kouprey could survive (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003, RJ. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). An assessment of 90% of camera trap photos from the region including the potential range of the Kouprey was made in 2011 (AWCSG 2011). Although Banteng, Wild Water Buffalo <em>Bubalus arnee</em>, and Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> were all recorded from the region, there were no camera trap images of Kouprey. A careful gap analysis of potential Kouprey sites was part of the first step of the study, but not all the relevant data could be examined. The majority of images from at least seven projects known to have captured wild cattle were not reviewed. This included two sets of photos from potentially important areas of eastern Cambodia. None of the landscapes assessed were sufficiently surveyed to rule out the presence of Kouprey, and for the foreseeable future, it will be impossible to identify every remaining individual wild ox to species in such areas. But there are no defensible grounds for considering the population of Kouprey to be anything other than negligible in such areas (single individuals or 2-3 animals), primarily because of the naturally lower densities of Kouprey compared with Banteng, the habitat specificity of Kouprey and its exceptional value in trade (Wharton 1957, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In eastern Cambodia there has now been substantial survey work (including observation-based field surveys and camera-trapping) which has documented hundreds of both Banteng and Gaur and even small numbers of Wild Water Buffalo (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. D. Evans and T. Clements pers. comm. 2008, Gray and Phan 2011, AWCSG 2011). This, in addition to suggesting Kouprey really has been hunted out, gives good numerical grounds to be confident that kouprey (historically the rarer species) no longer occurs in the ratio found by Wharton and that Kouprey declined significantly faster and was almost certainly less resilient to hunting than are the other species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Certainly fewer than 5,000 wild cattle now survive within the historical range of Kouprey, 90% or more of those within Cambodia and the majority of those within the eastern provinces (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). If Kouprey still survives, it is certainly only as individuals (not functional groups) in very low numbers; its extinction, if not yet upon us, is almost certainly sealed. Therefore future recommendations focus on protection of areas with the highest probability of harbouring Kouprey that are also high priority sites for other wildlife species, and further review of camera trap photos; rather than further survey efforts (AWCSG 2011).",Decreasing,"The historical distribution of this species was Cambodia, southern Lao PDR, southeast Thailand, and western Viet Nam (Grubb 2005).&#160;However, there is no recent (post-1970) confirmation in any of these countries and because of the obvious major declines in all congeners in this region in this period, this species is now thought to be possibly extinct.<p></p>","Kouprey is probably extinct, but if it persists it faces opportunistic hunting whenever encountered.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. If the species is still extant it is most likely to be in eastern Cambodia in one of four protected areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Mondulkiri Protection Forest and or Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area) (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011). There are no Kouprey in captivity, one existed in Vincennes Zoo, Paris, in 1937 and survived for about five years. There have been suggestions that domesticated Kouprey may survive in Cambodia (Hassanin <em>et al</em>. 2006). However this seems unlikely&#160;(R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and&#160; recent analysis of several nuclear genes revealed that a domesticated specimen was a hybrid between female Kouprey and male <em>Bos taurus</em>&#160;(Handschuh and Hassanin&#160;2013).&#160;<br/><br/>It is unlikely that specific survey work for Kouprey would produce any better evidence than has already been documented, and the best conservation measures for the species now would be to concentrate on <em>in situ</em> protection activities for large mammal communities in eastern Cambodia, especially building upon and strengthening the existing projects within the Srepok Wilderness Area of the Mondulkiri Protection Forest and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area (AWCSG 2011).",Indomalayan,last absolute confirmed date is 1969/70,true,false,Global
46363646,2891,Bos gaurus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Gaur qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion A (VU A2cd+3cd+4cd). The population&#160;decline in parts of its range especially Indochina and Malaysia,&#160;perhaps also Myanmar and China, is likely to be well over 70% over the last&#160;three generations (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), whereas in India&#160;and Nepal the overall decline rate is considerably lower. This reflects that in&#160;the various reasonably well-protected areas, and a small number of animals in some non-protected areas where they are protected for cultural reasons, population trends are stable, and in a few areas which have been neglected but are the focus of improved&#160;protection, populations are rebuilding. Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated average local extinction rates of Gaur distribution at 60% over past 50 years in India with the rates varying from 7% from reasonably protected habitats to a high of 98% from unprotected habitats. The global distribution of the Gaur has reduced by over 80% in past 100 years and Gaur is now mostly limited to habitats within protected areas (Groves and Grubb 2011). Weighting these by population size gives&#160;an overall decline of at least 30% over the last three generations. Similar&#160;reductions are projected, largely because the causative factors (especially wild&#160;meat hunting and hunting for the trade in horns in Southeast Asia, habitat loss and hunting for meat in South Asia) are still&#160;operative. Although the proportion of the global population which is in&#160;relatively well protected habitats in India is increasing, and thus the averaged global&#160;decline rate ought to decrease, an ongoing decline of 30% (in the next three generations) or more is adjudged likely. The recent history in Malaysia proves&#160;that directed Gaur poaching can induce rapid declines in regions previously&#160;judged relatively safe. Poaching in Malaysia is undertaken by international&#160;gangs and it is likely that once returns in Malaysia drop they will move to&#160;other countries, though there is no evidence for this yet; the patterns in other high-value species in more advanced&#160;declines (e.g. southeast Asian otters) indicate that incursion even to southern&#160;India is likely. The species could potentially qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C, although there are not enough quantitative data available.","The Gaur occurs from sea level up to at least 2,800 m asl (Wood 1937, Wharton 1968, Choudhury 2002). Despite the many reports that call it an animal of hill-country, low-lying areas seem to comprise optimal habitat (Choudhury 2002): in Conry’s (1989) study area, elevations ranged from 46 to 1,079 m asl but the three radio-tracked Gaur only used areas below 381 m. Elevations below 61 m were used most intensively and all three animals selected these low-lying areas; elevations above 61 m were selected against or used in proportion to availability (Conry 1989). Similarly, in the Tenasserim-Dawna mountains, Thailand, signs of Gaur were more abundant in the lowlands than in the hills, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities, although solitary animals were found mainly in the hills (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) compared vegetation maps of India with the (mid-20th century) distribution of Gaur and concluded that the species was largely confined to evergreen, semi-evergreen, and moist deciduous forest but it also occurred in dry deciduous forest areas at the periphery of its range. He considered Gaur habitat to be ""characterized by (1) large, relatively undisturbed forest tracts, (2) hilly terrain below an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 ft (1,500-1,800 m asl), (3) availability of water, and (4) an abundance of forage in the form of coarse grasses (including bamboo), shrubs, and trees"". However, He cautioned that the apparent preference of Gaur for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plains and other low lying areas to croplands and pastures. Kumar (2010) investigated factors influencing spatial distribution of Gaur abundance in Nagarahole-Bandipur reserves and observed that the Gaur abundance patterns were primarily determined by protection effectiveness, local levels of human disturbance and undulating terrain. He also observed that these ecological and anthropogenic factors induced variation in local abundance from less than 1 per km² to about 50 animals per km² (Kumar 2010). Similarly, Wharton (1968) concluded that Gaur appeared to avoid evergreen rainforest, ""preferring foothill tracts of sub-humid or deciduous forest adjacent to savannah forest, glades or other open terrain affected by man and fire thus co-existing with and exploiting low human populations in hill zones with moderate to heavy rainfall"". Throughout the range of Gaur, habitat destruction and human presence is usually higher in lowlands than in hills, meaning that differential human pressures may have caused the apparent preference of Gaur for hills. Gaur occurs in many forest types in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia including truly evergreen and montane forest, but populations in closed canopy forests especially those at higher elevations might naturally be at much lower densities than those in lowland areas with a mosaic of open and closed forest types, and in closed canopy forests areas the species appears to frequent grassy openings (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Greiser Johns 2000, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although no significant difference was found in overall Gaur densities in moist compared with dry deciduous forests in Nagarahole, India (Karanth and Sunquist 1992), local variation in Gaur densities ranged between less than 1 per km² to more than 45 per km² in Nagarahole and Bandipur reserves due to variation in local habitat factors conducive for Gaurs (Kumar 2010). Steinmetz et al. (in prep.) considered that Gaur herds in an expanding population were consistently concentrated in mixed deciduous forest rather than semi-evergreen forest, although the total area of study, that was safe from poaching, was only 20 km². <br/><br/>Gaur can persist in fragmented areas with some habitat disturbance and hunting, including in landscapes dominated by plantations (such as on parts of the Valparai plateau, south India), but in Southeast Asia it has been too heavily hunted in such areas to survive in them. Gaur can better tolerate rugged terrain and denser forest than other wild and domestic cattle, provided that there are adequate water sources (Kumar 2010, Smith and Xie Yan 2008). In Thailand it uses former cultivation amid forest, and populations in such areas can recover well if not hunted (Anak Pattanavipool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Gaur only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the Sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Gaur both grazes and browses, reportedly eating mostly young green grasses but also leaves, fruit, twigs, and bark of various woody species, as well as coarse dry grasses, and bamboo. It seems able to maintain good condition on relatively low quality feed. At least 180-190 species of plants have been recorded in the diet (Kumar 2010). More information is given about Gaur’s diet in Dunbar Brander (1923), Hubback (1937), Schaller (1967), Wharton (1968), Krishnan (1972), Khan (1973), Conry (1981), Ebil Yusof (1982), Ramachandran <em>et al</em>. (1986), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993) and Sankar <em>et </em>al. (2000). Captive Gaur are reported to eat about 20 kg of green fodder per day (Ramachandran et al. 1986). During the cool season (November-February) the Gaur that Schaller (1967) studied in central India ate various herbs, large quantities of the leaves and seeds of bamboo, various other grasses, and the leaves of a number of tree species; but by the beginning of the hot season (March-June) coarse dry and semi-dry grasses made up the bulk of their diet, averaging 85% by volume (range 66-100%; four rumen samples), with browse only making up about 10%. Gaur also feeds on crops including corn, cassava, and young rubber trees, sometimes causing great damage (Wharton 1968, National Research Council 1983). Schaller (1967) reported that Gaur in Kanha National Park drank at least once per day during the hot season, usually in the evening. The mean annual group size of re-introduced Gaur in Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, was estimated at 7.3 ± 0.76 (SE). The overall estimated summer, monsoon and winter home ranges of gaur were 290 km², 137 km² and 155 km² (Minimum Convex Polygon) respectively. The overall individual male home ranges varied from 135 to 142 km2, and overall individual female home ranges varied from 32 to 169 km2. In summer, Gaur largely preferred grassland (P&lt;0.0001), whereas in monsoon and winter, Gaur preferred bamboo mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001). Gaur avoided open mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001) and agricultural land in all three seasons. In total, Gaur fed on 68 plant species (Sankar <em>et al </em>2013). Sahai (1972) stated that Gaur drink at least twice in a 24-hour period but there appears to be no fixed time for drinking. In undisturbed areas, Gaur is mainly diurnal, but in areas of high human disturbance, it is reported to become mainly nocturnal.<br/><br/>The basic social group appears to be a female-juvenile unit with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages (as in the other large species of Asian Bovini). Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves frequently occur but their composition is somewhat fluid, particularly during the rut; these herds can often contain several subadult and adult males. The number of bulls in a herd changes with the time of year. Mature males associate with cows primarily during the rut: during Schaller’s study in Kanha National Park 65% of herds were accompanied by a mature male during April (the peak of the rut) but during the second half of the year the proportion dropped to 31% (Schaller 1967). Neither Schaller (1967) nor Sahai (1972) found any evidence to support Powell’s (1964) statement that young bulls usually live apart from the maternal herds; nor did Schaller’s observations support Dunbar Brander’s (1923) statement that the ’master bull’ drives all other males from the herd. Males not associating with mixed herds either live in all-male groups or are solitary. The bull herds are generally unstable, although sometimes two or more animals may frequently associate. The typical herd size appears to be in the range of 5-12 animals and herds are rarely larger than 20 (Dunbar Brander 1923, Hubback 1937, Hislop 1961a, Schaller 1967, Prater 1971, Sahai 1972, Pal and Guin 1986). Large groups of 20, 40, or even 100 animals are probably temporary aggregations of smaller groups (Pal and Guin 1986).<br/><br/>The majority of the 125-150 Gaur studied by Schaller (1967) in Kanha National Park (India) ranged over an area of at least 78 km²; and the herds he studied travelled on average 2-3 miles (3.2-4.8 km) a day, although on occasion the distance could be much less. In West Malaysia Gaur home ranges have been estimated to be: approximately 13 km² (the Kuala Tahan herd in Taman Negara National Park) (Weigum 1972); and 29.9 km² for a yearling male, 52.1 km² for a yearling female, and 137.3 km² for an adult male in Pahang (Conry 1989). The large differences between the two studies probably reflect the different methods employed by the two workers (see Conry 1989: 60). Home ranges that can be as large as 137 km² hinder the setting aside of conservation areas for Gaur, particularly as Gaur often occurs in those areas where the pressures for economic development are highest.<br/><br/>In central India, most Gaur mate in December and January, and calves are born in August and September according to Dunbar Brander (1923); Stebbing (1911) and Sanderson (1912) generally agreed with Dunbar Brander but noted that calves may also be born in April, May, and June. In Kanha National Park (central India) Schaller (1967) recorded rutting bulls from December to June, with an apparent peak of sexual behaviour in March and April; however, the occurrence of a few new-born animals throughout the year indicated that some mating must occur in every month. In southern India the majority of matings reportedly take place between November and March (Morris 1937). In Cambodia the majority of Gaur births occur in December and January (Wharton 1957). In Myanmar, calves are born throughout the year (Evans 1912, Peacock 1933); and in West Malaysia young Gaur are seen in all months except October to December (Hubback 1937).<br/><br/>The gestation period of Gaur is reported to be nine months by Hubback (1937) and Crandall (1964) and 270 days, ‘a little shorter than for Banteng or domestic cattle and longer than for yak and Kouprey’, by National Research Council (1983: 49). Only one calf is born to a cow per pregnancy; there are no records of twins (Hubback 1937, Schaller 1967). Females probably first mate when about two years old and thus have their first calf at three years old (Schaller 1967). If the food supply is favourable, most adult females probably calve every year. In Kanha National Park, approximately 90% of adult cows bore young during a year but calf mortality was high, with about 50% of the calves dying before reaching one year old; the main cause of death was predation by Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) (Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>Rarely, bulls kill each other when fighting, and occasionally they are severely injured while fighting. Predation is by far the major cause of Gaur mortality, perhaps followed by disease (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). For example in Bandipur, Gaur is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger (42%) and Leopard Panthera pardus (15%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur, Gaur remains were found in about 24% of Tiger faeces and 9% of Leopard faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, the proportion of Gaur in Tiger’s diet was about 45% in kills, 17% in scats (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Gaur together with Sambar contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Gaur is selectively predated by Tiger (Karanth and Sunquist 1995).","The set of threats and the gravity of each threat to Gaur differs greatly between south and central India, and Southeast Asia; China and most of northeast India are more similar to Southeast Asia in this respect (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008), and are so treated in the following discussion.<br/><br/>In Indochina, Myanmar, and northeast India, hunting is the major problem, compounded by loss of suitable habitat: large tracts of suitable habitat hold few or no Guar. Ongoing habitat degradation and conversion is continually reducing the potential population, should hunting be brought under control (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Choudhury 2002, Steinmetz 2004, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008, F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is often for meat and a variety of methods are used (Choudhury 2002). There is also a flourishing international trade in Gaur parts, both horns (decorative) and internal organs (for medicinal purposes). Given the small size of the remaining Southeast Asian subpopulations and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar during essentially opportunistic surveys, trade is clearly a major threat (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al</em>. 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Protection Forest (including the Srepok Wilderness area) and Phnom Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population immigration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in two areas, the most significant constraint to the area’s Gaur is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of the Srepok Wilderness Area and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area. Although conservation efforts for Gaur and many other species are, in both these areas, extremely encouraging, both face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated well trained staff. Almost throughout Southeast Asia, protected areas are not yet stalling declines in mammals with commercial value, such as Gaur. Areas with stabilized populations (in addition to the two Cambodian areas, perhaps only a few areas in Thailand (see Population) and Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam) are exceptional (R. Steimetz pers. comm. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, given its retention of healthy populations of other high-value very large mammals (Tiger and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>); Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 for elephants), Malaysia has among the most rapidly declining populations of Gaur. This reflects targeted hunting for large mammals of high commercial value, even within protected areas (Abdul Kadir 1998, Wan Shahruddin 1998, Lynam 1999, DWNP/Danced 2002, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). Given the rapid decline within the 1990s and the lack of information traced since 2002, the exact current situation of Gaur in Malaysia is unclear. Kemasul Forest Reserve, where the species was found in Laidlaw’s (2000) survey of virgin jungle reserves, probably no longer exists as such. Even at the time of survey, most of the Forest Reserve was due to be converted into an <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantation, although still nominally a Forest Reserve. Kemasul was, long ago, part of a massive block of lowland forest which included the famous Jengka Triangle and Krau ""Game"" Reserve. Only Krau remains, albeit much reduced (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). Even Krau, which was set up (in 1923) principally for the protection of Gaur, numerous in the area then, faces multiple threats (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). In the surveys for DWNP/DANCED (2002), evidence of hunting, including cartridges, was found within the reserve, particularly in the easily accessible lowland areas; there were plenty of hunting stories by and about all of the different local communities, without exception, although their preferred target species differed. Conversion from natural forest to other land-uses of adjacent state-land combined with new ease of access has undoubtedly made Krau more of a focal point for such activity. There is a new (metalled) road and land conversion right up to the boundaries, facilitating access and easing the use of hunting methods such as spotlighting, as well as reducing habitat. The salt licks (for which Krau used to be famous) increasingly fall outside the forest (reflecting shrinking reserve boundaries and farmland encroachment into the reserve) and are now mostly in zones of high human activity of one sort or another. Temporary grasslands generated through traditional indigenous farming, which were often fairly difficult to get to and thus relatively free from hunting, were previously important Gaur habitat. A forester who used to work in Malaysia in the 1940s said that Gaur herds used to follow the Orang Asli settlements, moving in when they moved out, and Weigum (1972) even recommended ""...to maintain herds in the park it is recommended that 45 acres of land be clear-cut preferably in 15 acre plots ½ mile apart and be recut every three years"". Gaur meat is, or at least was being, sold at restaurants in placed like Cameron and Grik.<br/><br/>In south and central India, densities are likely to be widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock, although this conclusion is based on rather few empirical studies and there are some outstanding populations in well-secured protected areas. Substantial declines and local extinctions of Gaur were driven by hunting (for meat), competition with livestock, and habitat conversion, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century, resulting in a drastically reduced and fragmented distributional range, especially outside the protected area network (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is much less prevalent than in Southeast Asia, reflecting the general enforcement of wildlife protection laws (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, even in high-profile reserves, it is still suppressing densities significantly. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low, because of poaching, by comparison with what the habitat should support (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the measured density in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park was only a third of that in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, preventive measures are uneven across it, and Gaur is still poached, at least sporadically, wherever protection effectiveness is low (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Gaur, has reportedly been exterminated from three Indian protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Interaction with domestic stock is greatly under-appreciated as a threat to Gaur, but is probably the main factor which currently limits populations in south and central India: livestock are widely grazed even in otherwise well-managed protected areas. Mean densities of Gaur were fully 132 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas of Bandipur, and in shared grazing areas Gaur densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities; in the grazed area studied, halving the livestock density allowed increases of Gaur by a factor of 57 (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but the effects of these on Gaur populations warrant further study. Killing of Gaur in retaliation to crop damage (through consumption and trampling) occurs, but is of limited significance to conservation (Choudhury 2002, Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Some animals also die from ingestion of agrochemicals, and human response when wandering into farmland and villages; these could be significant for already isolated and reduced populations (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>Throughout the range, diseases, particularly rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, transmitted by domestic cattle are a potentially serious threat. Foot-and-mouth is the most frequent, but rinderpest has had a particularly dramatic impact in India and several sub-populations of Gaur were nearly destroyed as a result of the disease in 1968 (Krishnan 1972, Pal and Guin 1986, Choudhury 2002), while in Bhadra, it nearly wiped out Gaur populations in 1988–1989, when nearly 800 individuals died (Girish D.V. pers. comm. 2008). In north and central Myanmar anthrax was a major factor in the decline of the species (Salter 1983). Pasha <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered that “in fact no wild animal in India [is] so profoundly influenced by transmitted infections from domestic livestock as Gaur”. There is little research or other evidence to determine impacts of introgression with domestic oxen on Gaur populations, although such factors might be expected to be most serious in India, given the wide overlap of domestic stock with Gaur. Farshid Ahrestani (pers. comm. 2008) saw a Gaur herd of 20 individuals far from human habitation with one domestic ox in the Palni Hills, so it seems likely that introgression occurs to at least some extent.<br/><br/>Srikosamtara and Suteethorn (1995) drew attention to the pressing threats facing Gaur, placing it in the same league of trade-driven threat as better-known species such as Tiger and Asian Elephant, and emphasising the international dimension of trade. Subsequently, the population collapse in Malaysia seems to have been driven by hunting teams from Lao PDR and Thailand (as proven by language at hunting camps in Temenggor), co-opting local Malaysian associates (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). It is reasonable to expect that when returns in Malaysia drop (as they probably have done already) these teams may turn their attention to other countries’ Gaur populations.","The global population is estimated to lie within 15,000-35,000 animals. Field data suggest that the proportion of mature individuals in the population is likely to be 0.4-0.6, indicating a total of 6,000-21,000 mature individuals, with fewer than 10 populations estimated to have over 1,000 individuals. Most population figures given for numbers of Gaur are little more than guesses.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, Gaur is probably extinct (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008). A few were thought still to occur in the Chittagong, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Sylhet, and Mymensingh areas in the early 1980s (Sarker and Sarker 1984), but none had been seen in Pablakhali Wildlife Sanctuary in the Hill Tracts since the early 1970s (Khan 1985). Choudhury (2002) stated that Gaur individuals from Mizoram and Tripura (India) still cross into Bangladesh, although the records on which this was based were not given. In Bhutan, Gaur apparently persists all over the southern foot-hill zone, notably in Royal Manas National Park, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, Gaur must have declined substantially, almost certainly by well over 50% in the period from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, they remained widespread, outside the lower Mekong and Tonle Sap lowlands, with large populations in some areas, although in generally low numbers overall (Heng Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998, Daltry and Momberg 2000, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). From the 1990s to the present almost certainly the rate of decline increased. By far the most substantial Gaur population of the country remained in eastern Cambodia centred on Mondulkiri province, where in the late 1990s potentially several hundred to a thousand may have survived in a forested landscape of over 15,000 km²; other significant populations probably numbering in the low 100s also remained in several other areas including Virachey National Park and adjacent forests, the northern plains including Preah Vihear Protection Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, the Prey Long area of the central plains and the Cardamom Mountains (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). With increasing national stability and economic growth further declines probably of the order of 50% or more, but more importantly an almost certainly accelerating rate of decline, took place from the early 1990s to the present (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). As of 2013 the most significant population by far in Cambodia still remained within Mondulkiri Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007; Gray 2012). Protection efforts in part of this landscape between 2005 and 2013 have probably stabilised the population there (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007). However increasing pressures, including an upsurge of snaring and wild-meat demand from Vietnam, since approximately 2015 mean this protection is now not sufficient and Gaur populations are likely declining. Distance-based line transects in the landscape fail to detect sufficient Gaur (<em>c.f.</em> Banteng) to robustly estimate population size (T. Gray pers. comm). Protection outside these two areas is limited and for Cambodia as a whole the trend is still a significant decrease (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In China, Gaur occurs in Yunnan and southeast Tibet (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995). Up until the 1950s–1960s, all sites in Yunnan (except Yingjiang) formed one large contiguous population, but this is now heavily fragmented. By the 1980s, the species was extinct in Lancang county, and the remaining animals were split into two populations: Xishuangbanna-Simao and Cangyuan (Wang Yingxiang verbally 1998 to Duckworth and Hedges 1998). Some sources suggest that a population of 600-800 existed in Yunnan Province in the mid-1990s, with the majority occurring in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995); other sources suggest that only small numbers of Gaur remain in Yunnan (along the border with Myanmar) and that hunting had led to the local extinction of Gaur in Xishuangbanna (Xiang and Santiapillai 1993).<br/><br/>In India, four major (Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, Central India and North-East) and two minor (Bihar and West Bengal) priority ‘Gaur conservation areas’ have been identified, reflecting the remaining distribution (Sankar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Choudhury 2002). The Western Ghats and their outflanking hills in south India constitute one of the most extensive extant strongholds of Gaur, with good numbers in Wynaad - Nagarahole – Mudumalai - Bandipur complex (Ranjitsinh 1997, Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Recent distributional assessment surveys in the Karnataka part of the Western Ghats showed the presence of Gaur in more than 60% of the 22,000 km² landscape (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Ranjitsinh (1997) estimated 12,000-22,000 Gaur in India, while Choudhury (2002) suggested that there were about 23,000-34,000 Gaur in India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh; but the true number is simply not known, as shown by the wide ranges. Reliable figures on Gaur population densities are rare because of the huge effort required to sample these low-density populations in dense forested areas (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Major populations have been reported in Nagarahole National Park (probably over 3,000; 5.1 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary (over 1000; 3 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Melghat Tiger Reserve (perhaps 1000; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Bandipur National Park (over 4,000; 5.3 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and adjoining areas (over 1,500 individuals) Kanha National Park (probably around 4000; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015), Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh (0.7 per 100 km²; Karanth and Nichols 2000) and Maharashtra (0.8 per 100 km² ,Karanth and Kumar 2005) (perhaps &gt;500 individuals), Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (re-introduced population, 65 individuals), Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (over 1,300; 1.8 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Periyar Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Annamalai range complex (Parambikulum, Valparai, and Grass Hills) (500-700), Silent Valley and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Agastyamalai forest complex (about 500), Biligirirangangswamy Wildlife Sanctuary (2.8 per 100 km²; Karanth 2013) and Cauvery-Malemahadeswara Hill range (0.2 to 0.7 per 100 km²; Rayar 2010) (together over 1500), Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest mosaic (perhaps about 700; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Kudremukh National Park and its adjoining forest complex including Someshwara and Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuaries (&gt;600), Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (&gt;1,200 individuals; 4.4 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2015); Satpura Tiger Reserve (&gt;1,000; 1.6 per 100 km²; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015). Many other areas are known or suspected to hold small populations, but in many sites such small numbers are unlikely to be viable (Choudhury 2002). For example, small populations of unknown size exist in Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Manas Sanctuary. Most of the foregoing figures are based on rigorous line transect survey methods. In recent years Gaur has reportedly been exterminated from three protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Information on population status from the states of Andhra Pradesh (probably over 300 individuals), Orissa and North-East is limited (Choudhury 2002); there are demonstrably very few Gaur in Kaziranga (Karanth and Nichols 2000). Gaur populations are known to fluctuate annually even in well-protected reserves such as Nagarahole and Bandipur (Karanth and Kumar unpub. data) due to a variety of reasons (disease outbreak, seasonal movement patterns etc). No densities could be estimated, despite the use of suitable survey methodology, at Kanha or Namdapha, implying relatively low populations, and none was found during such surveys at Kaziranga or Ranthambore (Karanth and Nichols 2000); only small numbers persist in Kaziranga (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Tripura, North East India, the estimated population of Gaur is &lt;50 individuals with estimated density as 1.5 individuals/km² (Dasgupta <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching (using snares, dogs and shotguns) and livestock grazing. However, the Gaur population there is now steadily increasing with successful conservation interventions (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar&#160; unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared the fauna of an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site: this found respective densities of six and two Gaurs per km² (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Byers <em>et al</em>. (1995) stated that the national population was approximately 1,000. This number is possible (field records exist from many areas), but animals would have been widely dispersed and at very low density in the extensive forest tracts across the country, with perhaps fewer than six sites holding more than 50 animals (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Steinmetz 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). A large population of Gaur was found in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and the adjoining Nakai Plateau in the mid 1990s, when signs were readily found and even the animals themselves seen directly (Duckworth 1998, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). Resurveys of both areas, although using comparable methodology only on the plateau, indicate massive declines in the subsequent decade, with, for example, fairly intensive camera-trapping not recording the species at all, although small numbers persist in localised areas of the interior (Dersu 2007; Johnson and Johnston 2007, C. Coudrat and Chanthavy Vongkhamheng in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). The last decade has seen major reductions (in general, probably of well over 50%), in many large mammal populations across Lao PDR and it is now likely that many of the populations listed in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) have become locally extinct (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In addition to Nakai Nam Theun NBCA, two other protected area, Nam Et–Phou Loey and Nam Kading National Biodiversity Conservation Areas have been relatively well surveyed (although not specifically for wild cattle) with disappointing results suggesting very small remnant Gaur populations, another area Xe Sap NBCA appears to retain a small but more substantial population, while a fourth area, Xe Pian NBCA, along the border with Cambodia (mainly in Champasak Province) may also have a more substantial population, but data are scarce (BirdLife International Cambodia Programme 2012, Timmins 2012, unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013, Akchousan Rasphone, J. Goodrich, C. Hallam and A. McWilliam in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). These five areas amount to the majority of the largest forest blocks remaining in Laos, with few other areas capable of supporting significant Gaur populations, but as of the end of 2013 it is likely that the most significant Gaur population survives in the extreme south of Lao along the border with Cambodia, particularly within Attapu province adjacent to the Virachey National Park area, in areas that remain poorly surveyed and not formally protected at the national level (unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, in 1994 the population was stated to be less than 500 individuals and it was thought to be declining (J. Brennan pers. comm. to Read <em>et al</em>. 1994; a number of other stated numbers from around that time, all of the same general order of a few hundred, and none derived allowing a quantification of error margin, are presented in Hedges in prep.), with then confirmed records from various sites, e.g., the Sungai Singgor area of Temenggor Forest Reserve, Hulu Perak (Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the subsequent few years, the population collapsed, despite optimism through relatively stronger control of guns in Malaysia than elsewhere on the southeast Asian mainland, and a perception (e.g., Nash 1993) of relatively strict control of wildlife trade in Malaysia. Densities in Taman Negara were crudely estimated from surveys during 1999-2001 as 0, 3 and 22 Gaurs per 100 km² in three study sites (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004). Although these authors adjudged large mammal poaching to be negligible in Taman Negara, high levels were confirmed there by Wan Shahruddin (1998) and camera-trapping (suitable in methodology and intensity to find Gaur if any significant numbers were present) did not record Gaur at a fourth sector of Taman Negara in 1999 (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). In 2015, camera-trapping work done by MYCAT in south-western Taman Negara corridor (outside the park) showed the existence of Gaur. How many animals were not ascertained. Also camera-trap of individuals and prints were seen in Taman Negara, the wildlife corridor as well as in the contiguous forest adjoining it (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016). No Gaur was photographed at all in eight other potential Tiger areas surveyed by Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2007) during 1997-1999, including Temenggor (see Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995); because these were selected as the areas most likely to support Tigers and as Tiger-oriented camera-trapping elsewhere in South-east Asia usually yields photographs of Gaur, this study proves that only very low numbers of Gaur remain in Malaysia, no doubt way below the estimate in Read et al. (1994). However WWF Malaysia does have records of Gaur still existing in Belum-Temenggor (M.T. Gumal pers. comm. 2016). Further supporting this,none was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006). Gaur was found in only two of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas), making it among the most localised mammal species which was detected in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves. The two occupied sites were a contiguous pair in each management class, and among the biggest sites surveyed (over 100 km²); the virgin jungle reserves themselves rarely exceed 3 km² (Laidlaw 2000). Also the Endau-Rompin landscape has been camera trapped between 2008 to 2015, and with 231 camera-trap stations and found no signs of Gaur (an effective camera trapping area of 4,179 km²) (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016).<br/><br/>In the 1960s, there were estimated to be approximately 40 Gaur in Krau Wildlife Reserve, a figure deemed optimistic at the time; in the 1980s there were thought to be 22-31; in 1995 the estimate was only seven. When surveying the reserve in 2000 (see DWNP/DANCED 2002), R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) covered the whole reserve (about 440 km²) with camera-traps in 119 one km-grid squares. Out of a total of 6,918 periods of 24-hour trapping, 61 species were recorded in 1,804 photographs of wildlife, yet only one photograph was of a Gaur. In almost 100 days of field searching for signs, Gaur tracks were recorded only on eight days, on each occasion as prints of isolated animals. The photograph, the sole sighting, and the eight track records were all in the south-east lowland area of the reserve, moving between an area of salt-licks and grazing just outside the reserve. This survey corroborated the 1995 estimate of seven animals, and the 2000-2001 figure could be even lower. Sumatran Rhinoceros (<em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>) and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) have both disappeared from Krau, and Gaur may be the next species to go. R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) considers there no reason to expect this recent history not to typify that of Gaur populations at all sites in Malaysia. There are very recent records from: Tanjong Mentong in Taman Negara, where tracks were found during elephant surveys in late 2006 (Nurul Huda, WCS Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); Belum, in 2007, where animals were camera-trapped at salt-licks several times, including a herd of seven (Ahmad Zafir, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); and Temenggor, where individual animals (no herds) were camera-trapped nine times (never at salt licks, always on logging roads) in 2,364 trap-nights in 25 locations (Mark Darmaraj, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008). A recent camera trapping study of fruiting gardens, which conducted 1024 camera trap nights at 15 sites within Krau, found no sign of Gaur (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the status of Gaur is poorly known (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006). A March 1994 survey of Taminthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar's largest protected area, guessed that 100-200 Gaur remained, and that they were in danger of being extirpated from the area if current levels of poaching continued (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1995). A national Tiger survey camera-trapped Gaur in 11 of 15 camera-trapped sites, commonly in several (Lynam 2003); these sites were selected for their chances of holding Tigers, so, because the two species face similar threats, it may present the most positive picture of Gaur occurrence in the country.<br/><br/>In Nepal, the Gaur population was estimated to be 250-350 in the mid-1990s, with the majority in Chitwan National Park and Parsa Wildlife Reserve; a few other areas hold small numbers (Choudhury 2002). In total the population of this species is more or less stable, with some annual fluctuations. A 2008 census in Parsa Wildlife Reserve counted up to 37 Gaur, in 2011 a combined survey of Parsa Wildlife Reserve and Chitwan National Park counted 21 and 312 respectively. In 2013, Parsa Wildlife Reserve showed a total of 69 animals, a marked increase from the last count. The Gaur population found in east Nepal mainly confined to Trijuga forest, Udayapur District has been nearly extirpated. Currently national count is being held and it is expected that the numbers will be higher than previous years. The rough estimate is around 400 in Nepal.<br/><br/>In Thailand, an estimated total of 920 Gaur remained in 1994. Only 6-7 populations were thought to contain 50 or more animals and there were no Gaur outside protected areas. The most important protected areas for Gaur were Khao Yai National Park, Tap Lan National Park and Pang Sida National Park, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaeng Krachan National Park and Mae Nam Phachi Wildlife Sanctuary, the Khlong Nakha complex, and possibly Om Koi and Mae Tuen Wildlife Sanctuaries. Even in protected areas with much suitable habitat Gaur densities were very low, for example in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary the population density was less than 50% of the estimated carrying capacity of the area (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1995, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000). Gaur populations are probably now increasing in several sites in Thailand, notably in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, with effective tackling of poaching. In Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, sign monitoring in one small area (20 km²) over six years since poaching absolutely ceased indicated an annual population growth rate there of 0.31, although the relative contributions of birth and immigration could not be distinguished. Breeding herds became much more common, compared with the situation 10-15 years previously at the height of poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park the population apparently expanded from two to 100 Gaur in less than 10 years, initially reflecting recolonization but apparently mostly from reproduction among animals at the site, all within a 10 km² area of secondary forest. The population stabilized at about 100 animals during 2004â€“2007 (based on counts from hilltops). As the forest grows and browse and grass diminish, reproduction is likely to decline (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). This herd has flourished only by dint of the provision of 24-hour security (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). Numbers also seem to be expanding rapidly in Kuiburi National Park in southern Thailand, again from an artificially lowered population and again within a secondary forest area adjacent to semi-evergreen forest. In early 2008, a (temporary) herd of almost 50 animals was spotted by elephant-watchers in a tree hide; only a few years previously, there were probably far fewer than this in the whole area (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007; R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). By contrast, Gaur is largely gone from southern Thailand forest remnants, although it may be safe on the Malaysian border, reflecting tight control of illegal access and activities by the Border Patrol Police, and the danger of operations because of insurgency (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the current status of Gaur is poorly known. Several areas in Dak Lak Province (the Easo and Easup areas and Yok Don National Park) were known to contain Gaur in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997) but very little reliable information was traced for other parts of the country by Duckworth and Hedges (1998). Several herds of Gaur persist in Cat Tien National Park and in adjacent state forest enterprises (Polet and Ling 2004), where the population is now probably stable and even perhaps increasing (based on various secondary and verbal sources R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Elsewhere however there seems little room for doubt that the Gaur population is still threatened, although at this point in time (late 2013) it is possible even probable that Gaur have largely been extirpated from all areas where no form of protection exists, and that even in most protected areas that harbour residual groups that declines are still the predominant trend, and many of the sites reported in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) may now have lost the species.",Decreasing,"Gaur historically occurred throughout mainland south and southeast Asia and Sri&#160;Lanka. Currently it occurs in scattered areas in the following range states:&#160;Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia only),&#160;Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, it is extinct in Sri Lanka and also, as&#160;a resident, apparently in Bangladesh (Grubb 2005, Md Anwarul Islam in litt.&#160;2008, Hedges in prep.). The species is now seriously fragmented within its&#160;range, and the mapped distribution is generalised, especially in India, Lao, Myanmar, China and Malaysia.The domesticated form of Gaur, considered by IUCN a separate species (<em>Bos&#160;frontalis</em>; Mythun, Mithan or Gayal), occurs in parts of India, China, and&#160;Myanmar as feral, semi-feral, and domestic animals. This animal is excluded from&#160;the red-listing considerations for Gaur.","The Gaur is hunted for food, medicinal products and handicrafts products. A domesticated 'form' of Gaur (considered by many, including for Red List purposes as a separate species <em>Bos frontalis</em>) occurs in parts of the Indian subcontinent and is used as a draught animal and for meat. However such uses do not supply the same markets as 'wild' Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> products.",Terrestrial,"Gaur is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. It occurs in many protected areas, although in north-east India, Myanmar, China, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Malaysia many such areas retain only tiny populations or have already lost the species.<br/><br/>South and central India have a well established network of wildlife refuges and protection activities, to a large extent, are effective in many of them (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008) and Gaur population in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in South India is perhaps the most secure one (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014) with about 5000 individuals (also the largest population of Gaurs in the world). However, conservation-oriented research and interventions on Gaur are limited and seem unlikely to expand much in the short-term, meaning that the species benefits largely through general protection activities (particularly those focused around Tiger and Asian Elephant), while species-specific negative factors or worrying long-term trends are likely to go unmanaged and even unnoticed (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). The chief of these seems to be competitive interaction with grazing stock: Gaur densities were the most depressed of all ungulates surveyed by Madhusudan (2004), perhaps reflecting higher niche overlap with domestic cattle than shown by the others (chiefly deer). There is long-term monitoring of some Gaur populations, for instance Mudumalai, Bandipur, Bhadra and Nagarahole (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008, Karanth and Kumar unpub. data). Rinderpest has reportedly been eradicated from India (Choudhury 2002). Choudhury (2002) listed proposed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in southern and central India. <br/><br/>In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Gaur (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth et al. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Gaur populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that out migration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>In contrast in Southeast Asia economic development and political stability in tandem with increased globalisation has resulted in accelerated loss and fragmentation of Gaur habitat, greater wildlife trade demand and a more insidious trade network (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Gaur population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Gaur presence through its historical range, to preserve Gaur genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region. <br/><br/>Gaur occurs mainly in protected areas in Southeast Asia, although Cambodia and Myanmar may both have large populations outside them and some may persist is such areas in Lao PDR (Duckworth 1996, Hansel 2004, SUFORD 2010). In most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia which still retain Gaur, protected status offers little, if any, real protection to the species, exceptions being Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam, the Srepok Wilderness Area and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area in Cambodia; in the latter two Cambodian areas, there are now even signs of population recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), as there are at Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, with effective tackling of poaching (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary form part of Thailand's 'Western Forest Complex' which if these recent gains are consolidated will, in the long term, hold the largest functional Gaur population in Thailand and perhaps South-east Asia. <br/><br/>The most important conservation measure for the species in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area and the Srepok Wilderness Area, and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, in Thailand it is to continue the consolidation of the 'Western Forest Complex' and to continue the high-intensity protection of the rebuilt herd in Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site, adjacent to Khao Yai National Park. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Part lies within the Wildlife Sanctuary and some of the rest of the outstanding plains habitat is within an enormous proposed extension. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Gaur conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Xe Sap, Nam Et-Phou Louey, and Nakai-Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Steinmetz 2004, Johnson et al. 2006, Timmins 2012) but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Gaur conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Gaur as the focus for efforts. Choudhury (2002) listed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in north-east India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and perhaps allow repopulation of Bangladesh. <br/><br/>The most important actions in Malaysia are to determine if any viable population remains in the country and, if so, to implement effective anti-poaching measures and to work at the policy level to allow effective control of large mammal hunting and trading. Under the current circumstances, any site-based activities are likely to require the sort of 24-hour security employed at the reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, which has allowed a rapid population growth of Gaur. It may also require reintroduction. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks have a breeding population of captive Gaur in enclosures in the Jenderak ranger station (within Krau Wildlife Reserve), for captive release. <br/><br/>A large captive population exists of wild-type Gaur (as well as of Mythun); given the complexity of field conservation of large ungulates, particularly in South-east Asia, it is clearly in resolving issues of hunting, trade, and protected area effectiveness that conservation interventions must focus.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The remaining world population totals under 4,000, with an estimate of fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. An inferred population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations (generation length estimated at 8–10 years) seems likely given the severity of the threats, especially hybridization; it is projected to continue into the future.<p></p>","<p>Wild Water Buffalo is very dependent on the availability of water and historically its preferred habitats were low-lying alluvial grasslands including <em>bheels</em> (ox-bow lakes and similar pools left by changing river courses) and their surrounds; river banks, and <em>chaporis</em> (small sandy islands within braided river systems). Riparian forests and woodlands were also used (Lydekker 1924, Prater 1971, Choudhury 1994).</p>  <p>The present distribution of Wild&#160;Water&#160;Buffalo should not be necessarily regarded as indicating its preference for particular ecotypes because human activities have largely excluded it from many areas.</p>  <p>In Nepal it now occurs only in the seasonally flooded grasslands and mixed forests of the SaptKosi floodplain. Dahmer (1978) provided a description of Buffalo habitat and habitat use in the area.&#160; In Bhutan and Assam, it occurs in alluvial grasslands along the Manas and Brahmaputra rivers—for more details about habitat characteristics in these areas see for example Spillet (1966), Lahan and Sonowal (1973),&#160;Jain and Hajra (1975),&#160;and Parihar <em>et al</em>. (1986). In the Bastar region of Madhya Pradesh (now Chhattisgarh) Buffalo inhabits tropical dry deciduous forests with an understorey dominated by grasses. It has also been reported to occur in the Sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>) forests in the area (Daniel and Grubh 1966, Mishra 2003). In Thailand it is now restricted to grasslands, mixed deciduous forest, and dry evergreen forest along rivers in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Nakhasathien and Stewart-Cox 1990; Uicharoensak 1992). In Sri Lanka Buffalo is particularly associated with grasslands, scrubby grasslands, and discontinuous forest areas. During the dry season it spends more of its time in forested areas (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Ashby and Santiapillai 1983).</p>  <p>Buffaloe spend considerable amounts of their time lying and wallowing in pools of water and/or mud. Where large pools of water are not available, Buffaloes will make use of smaller depressions, providing some moisture remains which they can churn to a muddy consistency. Wallowing has a thermoregulatory function. Buffaloes have fewer sweat glands per unit area of skin than do cattle and evaporative cooling through sweating is of little importance. Mud is considered more effective at cooling animals than is clean water because the water that is held in the mud evaporates slowly and so prolongs the cooling effect. Some reports suggest that for species such as Buffalo wallowing is essential for their survival but Tulloch’s (1970) studies of feral buffaloes in Australia do not support this conclusion; instead his results indicate that when buffaloes are deprived of wallows they behave more like cattle and seek shade (Tulloch 1970). Running water is also used for bathing (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Wallowing has the additional function of providing a thick coating of mud on the body that protects the animals from insect bites. </p>  <p>Buffaloes are very loyal to traditional trails and use the same routes repeatedly and this can lead to considerable erosion, particularly where trails cut down to river courses.</p>  <p>Information on the habitat use of feral <em>Bubalus bubalis</em> in Australia is provided by Tulloch (1969, 1970, 1979). Although, most of the habitat of Wild Buffalo is swampy, in Central India hard-ground habitats are used by Wild Buffalo where most of the water sources are human-made. The animals prefer dense forest during day time for grazing/browsing while they may feed in open forest with patchy grasslands during night. The use of water bodies is more common in the evening and late night due to human pressures in Udanti WLS (WTI 2012).&#160;</p><p>Research in both Assam and Sri Lanka has shown that herd movements are closely related to climatic factors, as one would expect from an animal so dependent on the availability of water. During the wet season in both regions Wild Water Buffalo tends to be widely dispersed and occur in small herds, but with the onset of the dry season the buffaloes tend to gather at permanent water holes and large aggregations can develop ( Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). In Wilpattu NP in Sri Lanka the herds of female Buffaloes and their offspring that are thought to be of the wild-type (the ‘forest buffalo’ of Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) remain attached to certain areas for long periods (i.e. they have well-defined home-ranges). As water sources begin to dry-out and forage availability declines these ranges may shift but they return to their original home ranges with the arrival of the rains. Males, especially subadults and the younger adults, tend to move over considerable distances during the mating season. A similar pattern of seasonal movements and site attachment has been reported from elsewhere in Sri Lanka particularly Ruhuna NP (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). The movements of animal are individually or in herds. The home range of Wild Water Buffalo in Udanti sanctuary is almost fixed and ranges between 15 and 20 km²,&#160;mostly around permanent water holes where there is no human disturbance (Mishra 2001, 2003).&#160;</p>  <p>Little published information is available about the daily movements of Wild Water Buffalo. In undisturbed areas it is reported to feed in the open at dusk and dawn, moving into cover and/or lying in wallows during the heat of the day. Nevertheless (feral) buffaloes will feed in open areas at mid-day, returning at intervals to shade and/or wallows.&#160;Daily movements of feral buffaloes are often rather predictable. Certain places within the home ranges of (feral) buffaloes are visited very frequently; these include latrines, rest areas (‘camps’), pools, mud-wallows, and particular trees, often close to wallows, against which buffaloes rub themselves (‘rubbing trees’). Obvious trails join these frequently used features.&#160;Wild Water Buffaloes are generally averse to human disturbance and seek refuge in the remotest habitats, the solitary bulls who seek domestic buffaloes for mating being an exception.&#160; In both Indravati and Pamed the Wild Water Buffalo prefers to come out during night only, whereas it is normally diurnal.&#160; Kotapalli villagers near Pamed reported buffaloes coming at 05.00 hours to the waterhole and disappearing after dawn.&#160;</p>  <p>The strong attachment of Wild Water Buffalo to known ranges can have unfortunate consequences particularly when water and/or food are scarce. Feral buffaloes (in Australia) have been known to die of thirst rather than walk approximately five kilometres to a large lagoon used by other buffaloes (Tulloch 1970). They are thought to range as high as 1500m asl (S. Hedges pers. comm. to Choudury 2014) in the Western Ghats.</p>  <p>Little has been published on the diet of wild (or feral) <em>Bubalus bubalis</em>. It is probably a grazer by preference, feeding mainly on grasses when available, but it also eat herbs, fruits, and bark as well as browsing trees and shrubs. Daniel and Grubh (1966) list <em>Cynodon dactylon</em>, <em>Themeda quadrivalvis</em>, and <em>Coix</em> sp. as grasses that are known to be eaten by Wild Water Buffalo in India. They also saw Buffalo feeding on the sedge <em>Cyperus corymbosus</em>. Dahmer (1978), Shrestha (1981), and Kushwaha (1986) provide a little information about the diet of Buffalo in Nepal. Wild Water Buffalo also feed on crops, including rice, sugar cane, and jute, sometimes causing considerable damage (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Kushwaha 1986, Bauer 1987).&#160;</p>  <p>Wild Water Buffalo is reported to be a selective feeder and to wander long distances in the course of grazing (Daniel and Grubh 1966). Feral buffaloes in Australia also graze selectively &#160;according to Tulloch <em>et al</em>. (1986) but Moran (1987) reported that they are far less selective than are Brahman cattle. Buffaloes in Sri Lanka are reported to eat nearly anything in their path (Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). Wild Water Buffalo seems to have a higher tolerance for saline water than do many mammals and will drink from brackish pools (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972).</p>  <p>The Wild Water Buffalo may invade farmland to depredate crops like rice, <em>Dolichos biflorus</em>, <em>Vicoa mungo </em>and <em>Brassica campestris </em>(Mishra 2002, 2004; WTI 2009).</p>Typically, it forms maternal groups of loosely structured herds, typically containing 10–20, but up to 100, individuals, year round. Adult males form bachelor herds of up to 10 individuals, with older males often solitary. The species exhibits a polygynous mating system, with females typically giving birth to single offspring, although twins are possible. It is a seasonal breeder in most of its range, typically in October and November, however, some populations breed year round. Its gestation lasts 10-11 months, with an interbirth interval of one year. Age at sexual maturity is 18 months for males, and three years for females. The maximum known lifespan is 25 years in the wild (Nowak 1999).","<p>The major threats to Wild Water Buffalo are loss of genetic diversity due to introgression with domestic and feral buffaloes, as well as threats from hunting, and disease from domestic livestock.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Genetic Factors</strong></p>  <p>It is highly likely that the existence of Wild Water Buffalo is being threatened by genetic introgression from domestic buffaloes in Nepal (Flamand <em>et al</em>. 2003). In India, hybridisation is thought to be evident in the North-east where wild buffaloes are known to hybridise with <em>Khunti</em> (cattle camp) buffaloes which were grazed within the park prior to their eviction (Muley 2001). However, it was suggested that there is a genetic differentiation between wild and domestic/feral buffaloes in Kaziranga National Park, and that the Wild Water Buffalo is comparable to Wild Water Buffalo in central India (CCMB 2010). Although, the central Indian buffaloes do live along with hybrid and feral buffaloes, so introgression could have occurred to some degree in both locations. Introgression is likely to take place throughout the range wherever wild and domestic buffalo come into contact. It is estimated that more than 90% of the population exists in the vicinity of considerable populations of Domestic Water Buffalo (See Table 1. in the Supporting Information: <em>B. arnee</em> additional information populations in vicinity of Domestic Water Buffalo). This means there is a the risk of hybridisation&#160;is high. As the wild populations shrink &#160;and become fragmented the risk of hybridisation increases exponentially (within a few generations). Given the fragmented nature of the populations and the proximity of Domestic Water Buffalo, and applying the precautionary principle, the truly pure Wild Water Buffalo population could half of the current estimated population, or less.&#160;</p>  <p>In evolutionary terms wild and domesticated water buffaloes are closely related, being separated by perhaps as little as 5,000 years (Cockrill 1974, S. Hedges in prep). The phylogeny of buffaloes has not been fully resolved and it is unclear as to the number of domestication events that have occurred in the case of this species. At least two separate domestications, one for ‘swamp’ and one for ‘river’ type buffalo are thought to have taken place (Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Yindee <em>et al</em>. 2010, Babar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) Additionally, the practise in some villages, of allowing wild buffalo to sire calves with domestics (Flamand <em>et al</em>. 2003) may have resulted in continued gene flow between the two, at least in one direction. The situation is analogous to other species which are the progenitors of domesticated forms especially that of the wild cat <em>Felis</em> (Beaumont <em>et al.</em> 2001. This may be particularly the case in Indochina where traditional methods of Domestic Water Buffalo husbandry allowed animals to wander freely for the majority of the year, often in natural habitat over 5 km from villages; indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether animals in forest areas are domesticated or truly feral; as such before hunting largely eliminated the Wild Water Buffalo population there must have been much contact between the two species, and presumably a great deal of opportunity for introgression, albeit perhaps strongly in one direction, given the male-dominated mating system of water buffalo (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Domestic Water Buffalo in ‘frontier’ rural areas of Indochina often show a strong similarity to published and other widely available images of Thai and Indian Wild Water Buffaloes (R. J Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), while Clark (undated) wrote that neither local people nor experienced hunters could distinguish Wild and Domestic Water Buffaloes on the basis of physical appearance, on the Lagna (La Ngà) River alluvial plains of southern Vietnam where the two occurred together, and that they were only identifiable on the basis of their behaviour: further evidence that the genepools of Indochinese Domestic Water Buffalo and Wild Water Buffalo are probably very close.&#160;</p>  <p>Whilst it is likely that the genetic integrity of Wild Water Buffalo is threatened by introgression from the domestic form, the risk of inbreeding within the dwindling populations of Wild Buffalo must not be underestimated as a threat to its survival. Small populations are at risk of inbreeding depression (i.e. lowered reproductive fitness) which can in turn lead to further population decline (Hendrick and Kalinowski 2000). The small population size of Wild Water Buffalo in central India (34–42 individuals), means that there is a high risk of extinction through demographic factors (WTI 2010). For example, stochastic variation in demographic rates causes small populations to fluctuate randomly in size. Wild Water Buffalo in some populations may face the risk of inbreeding effects through low population numbers. Whilst introgression with domestic forms may paradoxically have the ability to mitigate some of the inbreeding risk by injecting genetic diversity, it carries with it the risk of erosion of the genetic diversity unique to the wild form (as mentioned above).&#160;</p>  <p>A challenge to the captive breeding of wild buffalo will be balancing the relative risks of inbreeding and out breeding when choosing candidate animals for a breeding programme. This is likely to require a detailed level of genetic screening, the technical challenges of which must not be underestimated (Randi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since introgressed buffaloes may outnumber non-introgressed Wild Buffaloes considerably, it may be necessary to view introgressed animals as a vital genetic resource from which wild genetic diversity can be recaptured through controlled backcrossing, as opposed to viewing them as animals tainted by domestic introgression.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Hunting</strong></p>  <p>Wild Buffaloes have for long been hunted ritually, owing to their formidable nature and horns. Besides sport hunting that was prolific until the 1960s, hunting for meat is also a popular practice in several parts of North-east India as well as in many South-east Asian countries. With legal protection of Wild Water Buffalo in India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Thailand (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2008), the severity of hunting may have reduced over the recent past. Although poaching for wild meat is still a real threat to any remaining Wild Water Buffalo populations in South-east Asia, especially Cambodia and Myanmar, trophy hunting may be the most worrying threat, especially if general knowledge of the existence of remnant populations grows, as the economic growth in the region has seen massive growth in exploitation of valuable natural resources, such as wildlife-derived status symbols (R.J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>  <p>However, <em>Paradh</em>, traditional community hunting, still persists in some part of central India (Mishra 2000). Also, extensive droughts and habitat fragmentation and degradation have caused Wild Water Buffaloes habitually to invade and raid crops, leading to repercussions by local villagers. This perhaps single-handedly has led to a severe population decline in many states such as in Chhattisgarh.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Disease</strong></p>  <p>One of the persistent threats to wildlife is the threat of disease outbreaks from livestock raised in the surrounding villages.&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">For instance, several sub-populations of &#160;another large bovid, the Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>), in peninsular India, were known to have been almost exterminated through a severe outbreak of Rinderpest in 1968 (Krishnan 1972). Similarly, Wild Water Buffaloes are also susceptible to a number of cattle diseases, and therefore, where very small populations remain, they face the risks of extinction due to disease.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation: </strong></p>  <p>Wild Buffaloes like most other large herbivores, require large spaces with adequate food and water supply to survive which is negatively impacted by fragmentation and degradation of forest and grassland areas. Although most cattle camps have been removed from within Kaziranga in Assam, extensive livestock grazing in Chhattisgarh may place the Wild Water Buffaloes there in situations of severe resource competition. This is because of pasture depletion and lack of water resources, which could lead to direct conflict.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Local community and insurgency</strong></p>  <p>There are areas in central India where Wild Water Buffalo exists and there are difficulties of insurgency and law and order problems. The result is that in such areas, conservation is often difficult to achieve without the support of local people.&#160;</p>  <p>Probably one of the most significant constraints, is an under appreciation even amongst conservation organisations of the importance, significance and plight of Wild Water Buffalo populations (Choudhury 2010). This is exemplified by the situation in Cambodia where next-to-no species-specific action has been taken for Wild Water Buffalo, despite the known presence of a remnant population in one area, with to date the fear that the population may have declined and possibly even been lost (R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013).<em></em></p>","<p>The total world population of Wild Water Buffalo is almost certainly less than 4,000 animals, occupying an area of less than 20,000 km². However, these figures are little more than informed guesses, because any assessment of buffalo numbers is hampered by the difficulty of distinguishing between free-ranging domestic buffaloes, feral buffaloes, truly wild buffaloes, and hybrids between wild and other buffaloes. Individuals of Wild Water Buffalo and Domestic Water Buffalo are difficult to distinguish in some areas, and some domestic populations may be very closely related to (perhaps identical to) Wild Water Buffalo, as in Cambodia, where traditional forms of buffalo husbandry allow herds to range freely in forest areas (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) or in Kaziranga, India, where in the past cattle camps for grazing wild buffalos existed within the National Park (Choudhury 2010). There have been few detailed analyses of the purity of the presumed remaining Wild Water Buffalo populations, however a benchmark for the purity of the species remains a question. The Domestic Water Buffalo occurs as feral and domesticated populations worldwide, including in sympatry with most remaining populations of Wild Water Buffalo (Grubb 2005, S. Hedges pers comm. 2008). Some feral and domestic populations may well have conservation significance, retaining some of the genetic stock of the wild populations for that particular region, this may be especially true in Indochina because of traditional methods of Water Buffalo husbandry (S. Hedges pers comm. 1994, 2008; Timmins and Ou 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008); and continues to be a matter for debate in the islands of the Sundas and Sri Lanka, where prehistoric presence of Wild Water Buffalo seems likely, but the Holocene history of human manipulation of Domestic Water Buffalo severely clouds the determination of how to treat remaining populations of free living water buffaloes there.&#160;</p>  <p>In India a preliminary investigation comparing genetic traits of the northeastern and the central Indian population suggested that both populations to be related with the Kaziranga samples showing differentiation into three district clades of wild, mixed and feral. The Central Indian population showed no such distinctions (CCMB 2010).<br/><br/> Within India, Choudhury (1994) suggests that there could be about 3,300-3,500 animals in northeast India alone, although later he revised the figure to 2,800-3,000 individuals (Choudhury 2010).</p><p>According to Divekar and Bhushan (1988), the total estimate of Wild Buffalo population in Chhattisgarh (Central India) was 104, whereas an estimate by the Forest Department in the year 1986-87 was perhaps an exaggerated 240. Divekar and Bhushan (1988) estimated about 26 Wild Buffaloes were restricted to the Pillur meadow and Pengonda area of Indravati NP, 25 each in Pamed Wildlife Sanctuary and Udanti Wildlife Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh. Ranjitsinh <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated the population in Udanti as between 42 and 44 with about 25-30 individuals in Indravati National Park. Mishra (2002, 2004) and Mishra and Kotwal (2003) estimated that less than 70 Wild Buffaloes occurred in Central India. There are presently eleven wild buffalo in Udanti with only one female (in captivity) and six wild males and one female&#160; calf. Therefore in two decades or so the population here has shown a massive decline.&#160;</p>  <p>The majority of the Wild Buffalo assemblage in India is restricted to the north-eastern states of India, with Assam accounting for most of the population spread across several protected areas of the state. The state of wild buffalo in northeast India is as follows:&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Assam </strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Kaziranga National Park: </em></strong>Kaziranga NP constitutes perhaps one of India's most important Wild Buffalo habitats, harbouring the largest aggregate of the species along with a number of flagships, including the Indian one horned rhinoceros and the Asian elephant. Kaziranga NP, spans over 850 Km<sup>2 </sup>over three districts of Assam, and has approximately 2,600 individuals as per the departmental counts in 2011.<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Manas National Park:</em></strong> Situated across two districts of Assam, namely, Baksa and Chirang, and covering around 500 km² of rich habitats, the park is known to harbour around 250 individuals reported during the 2008 census. The adjoining reserve forest areas bound between the national park and the Sankosh river in the west, are believed to hold an additional 30 or more individuals.&#160;</p>  <p><strong><em>Dibru-Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary: </em></strong>Located along the Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts of Assam, and spanning over 340 km² of riverine tracts and willow swamp forests, the park is thought to shelter more than 400 Wild Buffaloes, as per the 2008 census (Choudhury 2010).&#160;</p>  <p>Besides the above, several other areas in Assam have been reported to harbour Wild Buffalo herds, both in the past as well as in the present. Of these, Borachapori and Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuaries have been found to harbour around 75 individuals (Choudhury 2010), while Pabha Reserve Forests adjoining Borachapori WLS also harbour dispersing individuals as well as seasonally migrant herds from Borachapori. Additionally, other areas of Assam, such as the Kadam Reserve Forests and the Dhakuakhana area of Lakhimpur district, were both known to hold small populations, but today are known to harbour only a few straggler individuals. In fact a survey in 2009 in Kadam Reserve Forests revealed only a single lone bull in the area. Additionally the Dum Duma Reserve Forests along the Lohit river, have revealed around 13+ Wild Buffaloes by Choudhury (1994), although no earlier records of the species’ presence in this area exits. </p>  <p>Lastly, a number of areas, including the discontinuous patches of forests and grasslands of Kollolua-Jokai, the reserve forests of Batabari and Doadhara, Orang National Park, Pabitora WLS, Gali, Jamjing, Sengajan and Kobo Chapori Reserve Forests of Dhemaji district, the Kakoi, Dulung, as well as the Sonai-Rupai WLS and Pabho Reserve Forest patches of Lakhimpur district, have all been viable habitats of the Wild Buffalo in the past, but have unfortunately lost all traces of the species over the recent past. A few of the above areas however, intermittently harbour either small herd of feral buffaloes of highly decimated remnants of erstwhile populations, mostly represented by few stragglers.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Meghalaya</strong></p>  <p>Very few historical accounts of the presence of Wild Buffaloes in the state of Meghalaya exist. However, more recent reports suggest that small, low density populations may exist in the Balapakram National Park of the state as well as a few remnant herds in the Nokrek National Park. Choudhury (2010) has suggested that no more than 50 individuals possibly thrive in this part of the landscape, although more systematic species-specific surveys may be needed in these areas to confirm the presence of remnants of the true Wild Buffalo.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Arunachal Pradesh</strong></p>  <p>A state with an unlikely terrain for the existence of the Wild Buffalo, it is nonetheless thought to bear a few individuals in the D’ering WLS and the Lohit Valley in the Lohit district of the state. Additionally, the Mebo Reserve Forests in East Siang district were also thought to have around 20-25 individuals surviving until the 1960s, although current status suggests that the species is now non-existent.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>West Bengal</strong></p>  <p>Although a number of areas in the state of West Bengal have been reported to have sustained several small subpopulations of Wild Buffalo, especially in the Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts, currently no recognized Wild Buffalo populations exist in the state. The last accounts of the species from the state date back to almost 1928 (Choudhury 2010).<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Bihar</strong></p>  <p>The state is known to have sustained widely distributed populations of the species in the past (Ali 1927), especially in the northern areas of Purnea, Sharsa and Darbhanga districts. Although it is now recognized to have gone extinct from the state, post the 1960’s (Daniel and Grubh 1966). </p>  <p><strong>OTHER COUNTRIES</strong><strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Nepal</strong></p>  <p>The only remaining Wild Buffalo population today in Nepal exists in the Koshi-Tappu Wildlife Reserve, with around 220 individuals being tallied in 2008, through a census conducted by the reserve authorities. Besides this, remnant populations were also known to exist in the Chitwan National Park until the 1960s, and also in Bardia National Park until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century&#160;(Heinen, 1993, 2006, from Choudhury 2010).<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Bangladesh</strong></p>  <p>While numerous supopulations have been reported to have existed across the landscape of Bangladesh over varied periods of time, today almost no reports exist of wild sub-populations or even population remnants. Earlier, several reports on the presence of Wild Buffaloes have come from Fardipur, Chittagong hills, Shirajganj, Dinajpur and Bhola districts. Interestingly, reports from the Mymensingh and Sylhet districts suggest that small populations may have survived up to the earlier part of the twentieth century as well.<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Sri Lanka</strong></p>  <p>Although the Wild Buffaloes in Sri Lanka have been suspected to have originated from feral domestic stocks, owing to the historical absence of Wild Buffalo populations south of the Godavari river in India, the remnant populations today account for a substantial population of almost 2,000 individuals. This aggregate, nonetheless, is isolated largely to the Ruhuna National Park, in the south-eastern part of the country (de Silva <em>et al. </em>1994).&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Bhutan</strong></p>  <p>Some individuals (about 12) have been seen in Manas National Park (Rob Stenimetz pers obs.) and also in Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary (Kaul R. pers. comm).<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Thailand</strong></p><p>Thailand today is known to harbour only a small population of Wild Buffaloes. About 35-40 individuals have been reported from the Huay Kha Khaeng WLS in western Thailand (Rob Steinmetz <em>pers. comm</em>). Additionally, small aggregates have also been reported from Khao Soi Dao WLS, although currently no information on their presence exists from here.</p>  <p><strong>Viet Nam</strong></p><p>Before 1999, there was reportedly a population in Mom Ray, Viet Nam, but this population no longer exists (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006). Rumours still persist of presence in other areas, for example the Satay region (Tordoff&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Wild buffaloes of the Cambodian population may wander into western Dak Lak province, but no recent records in Viet Nam have been confirmed to represent wild Water Buffalo (Le Xuan Canh&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997, Eames&#160;<em>et al. </em>2004, Tordoff&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).</p>  <p><strong>Cambodia</strong></p>  <p>Cambodia perhaps has the smallest population aggregates of the Wild Buffalo among the south-east Asian countries, although it was formerly excluded from the historical distribution range of the species. Camera trapping evidences of presumed wild buffaloes from four locations (7 encounters; 1-3 individuals per photograph) in the core area of Mondulkiri Protected Forest, west of the Srepok river in the year 2005 suggests that the species may be present in some areas (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005,&#160;Thompson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). However, ongoing camera trapping studies by WWF have failed to detect presence of any buffalos recently.&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Myanmar</strong></p><p>There is doubt about the status of with wild buffalo in Myanmar. Seems to be confirmed presence of wild buffalo from the Indo Myanmar border, along the Bulong&#160; river in the Sagaing state (Choudhury 2010). The genetic status of wild buffalo living in the Hukang Valley , north Myanmar is doubtful.&#160;</p><p><strong>Lao PDR</strong></p><p>The population on Lao PDR is extinct, but the date of local extinction is unknown&#160;(Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999).</p>",Decreasing,"During the Pleistocene epoch the genus <em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Bubalus </em>was widely distributed throughout Europe and southern Asia and contained forms conspecific with <em>B. arnee</em>. When the climate became drier the genus became restricted to the Indian subcontinent, mainland South-east Asia, and some of the South-east Asian islands. In historical times <em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">B. arnee</em> ranged across South and South-east Asia, occurring from Mesopotamia to Indochina (Esptein 1971, Mason 1974, Cockrill 1984).&#160;<p> Remnant populations of Wild Water Buffalo are thought to occur at single sites in each of southern Nepal, southern Bhutan, western Thailand, eastern Cambodia, and northern Myanmar, and at several sites in India: in the Central India and the North-east, predominantly in Assam.</p>  <p>Wild Water Buffalo is believed to be extinct in Bangladesh, Peninsular Malaysia, and on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. The domestic form (considered by IUCN as <em>B. bubalis</em>) occurs as feral and domesticated populations worldwide (Grubb 2005).<br/> <br/> Although the species has been speculated to have become extinct in Viet Nam, Myanmar and Cambodia (Corbet and Hill 1992), relatively recent surveys have revealed the confirmed presence of Wild Water Buffalo populations in Cambodia. Another recent survey along the Indo-Myanmar border confirmed the presence of small &#160;possibly remnant subpopulations of free ranging buffaloes along the Balong river in Sagaing state of Myanmar (from Choudhury 2010). Wild living water buffaloes in the Hukaung Valley, of northern Myanmar may or may not be of largely or purely Wild Water Buffalo origin (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006).&#160; <br/> <br/> The origin and current genetic status of the herds of apparently wild buffaloes in Sri Lanka is uncertain but it is thought unlikely that any true wild buffaloes remain there today. Corbet and Hill (1992) included Sri Lanka within the historical range of Wild Water Buffalo, although Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951), Gee (1964), and Maia (1970) thought that the Sri Lankan buffaloes were descended from introduced domestic stock. Certain ancient texts seem to support this view (Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). The fact that no buffaloes occur south of the Godavari river in India has also been taken to suggest that Sri Lanka possesses only feral buffaloes descended from introduced animals. However, Deraniyagala (1953), considered that the occurrence of fossil buffalo teeth in the gem sands of the Ratnapura area disproved this view, although it is not clear how old these buffalo teeth are (and Gaur remains found at similar depths in the same area were less than 1,000 years old). Moreover, morphometrics suggest that there was an ancestral population of animals on that island closer to Wild Water Buffalo than to Domestic Water Buffalo (Groves and Jayantha Jayawardene unpublished). Nevertheless, even if the Water Buffalo is indigenous to Sri Lanka the question of whether the free-living herds found there today should be treated as wild <em>B. arnee</em> still arises. In the nineteenth-century, free-ranging herds were common over much of the island’s dry low country but they were nearly eliminated by an outbreak of rinderpest at the end of the century, and for a time their survival was in doubt (Phillips 1935). Phillips reported that small populations might have survived in the hill country but the subsequent intensification of agriculture probably led to their demise (Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). After the rinderpest outbreak buffalo recolonized much of the dry zone but most of the animals had apparently interbred with domestic stock and in 1953 Deraniyagala wrote ‘[the] relatively purest herds are restricted to Yala Game Sanctuary, but much vigilance will be necessary if this remnant is to be kept free from domestic animals which are now encroaching upon this once inaccessible area’. Woodford (1979) also suggested that the genetic integrity of the wild form has already been lost in Ruhuna. To conclude, even if it is assumed that Wild Water Buffalo once occurred on Sri Lanka it seems unlikely that it survived the rinderpest outbreak and the subsequent genetic swamping by feral and domestic buffaloes: consequently all free-living buffalo populations on Sri Lanka almost certainly contain genetic input from domestic or feral stock.<br/> <br/> Neither Java nor Sumatra are included within the original range of wild <em>Bubalus arnee</em> as presented in many accounts. Nevertheless Stremme (1911) thought that the occurrence of the fossil <em>B. palaeokerabau</em> in Java made it probable that the buffaloes there belonged to the original fauna of the island (as Cuvier believed). Merkens (1927) also doubted, on historical grounds, the domestic origin of all free-living buffaloes on the island as did Mason (1974) who stated that domestic buffalo were present on Sumatra and Java long before the Hindus arrived almost 2,000 years ago. Moreover van der Maarel (1932) provisionally regarded the fossil specimens which he obtained from Java (and indeed <em>B. palaeokerabau</em>) as specifically indistinct from modern buffaloes, pointing to a Pleistocene presence of the species on the island (<em>cf</em>. Medway 1972). Corbet and Hill (1992) also thought it probable that wild buffaloes occur on Java and Sumatra. Despite the doubts raised by van der Maarel and Dammerman there is in fact little doubt that all the apparently wild buffaloes now living on Java and Sumatra are descended from domestic animals, or from Wild Water Buffaloes that have interbred with domestic and/or feral buffaloes (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Opinion is divided over whether to include Borneo within the historic range of the species. Corbet and Hill (1992) did not list it, and neither Mason (1974) nor Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered it likely that Water Buffalo was part of the indigenous fauna. Lydekker (1898), by contrast, described the small buffalo of Sarawak as a separate subspecies (<em>B. b. hosei</em>), although Mason (1974) thought that Lydekker was probably describing the feral animals which were common there. Cockrill (1968) suggested that traders from the Hindu empire in Sumatra may have introduced the buffalo in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and he did not think that there was any convincing evidence that would suggest that it was an indigenous species. Nevertheless, animal remains from the Niah caves indicate a Stone Age presence of buffalo in Sarawak (Harrisson 1961). Van Strien (1986) also considered it probable that <em>Bubalus bubalis</em> was part of the original fauna of the island and gave north-west Borneo as its current distribution. Harrisson, however, thought that the wild form was extinct. Feral (and semi-feral) buffaloes were formerly numerous throughout Borneo but the current status of the island’s feral population is poorly known. What does seem certain, however, is that even if the species is indigenous to the island (as seems to be the case) no true wild <em>B. arnee</em> occur there today since such animals would have been genetically swamped by the numerous feral animals some of which were descended from buffaloes introduced from outside Borneo (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).</p>","The Wild Water Buffalo is hunted for food, sport, and handicrafts products. Domestic Water Buffalo is considered a separate species, so its uses are not considered here, and additionally uses/markets for derivatives of the two species are likely to be largely independent of one another.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Wild Water Buffalo is included in CITES under Appendix III (Nepal). It is legally protected in Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Thailand. The Cambodia population was a major factor in the decision to place further protection on the area, now designated as Mondulkiri Protection Forest, and a significant factor in the decision to establish the Srepok Wilderness Area Project of the Cambodian Department of Forestry and WWF (Goodman <em>et al</em>. 2003; R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Most of the known populations are within protected areas. In Myanmar, which retains true lowland floodplains in near-natural state in the Hukaung Valley, the protected area system originally almost entirely excluded floodplain grasslands. The inclusion of some areas is now under consideration, and would benefit this species. However, the outcome is far from certain (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>Most remaining populations still require practical protection from hunting (especially those in Thailand and Cambodia, and Myanmar if still extant), but probably the greater threat in South Asia is protection from contact with other domestic bovines, especially Domestic Water Buffalo. <br/><br/>There is an urgent need to evaluate the integrity of wild-living buffalo populations, including those generally taken as being truly wild and those living as wild animals within the native range, using habitat typical of wild animals, and which have lived outside even occasional husbandry for a long time, in order to determine populations of conservation priority. This should involve the assessment of the relationship of such populations in the context of obvious domestic lineages, especially those in close proximity to wild populations. Such an approach should use multiple genetic markers in addition to an assessment of morphological characteristics. <br/><br/>Surveys to investigate current status of wild-living populations are needed in Myanmar and perhaps the Satay district of Viet Nam.<br/><p>In India, a Conservation Action Plan has been developed recently seeking to recover the Wild Water Buffalo in central India.

Furthermore, there is evidence of severe hunting in several parts of its range, and it is the armadillo species that is most sought after by hunters in the llanos of Colombia. In Colombia, locals have reported a reduction in sightings of this species, but due to a lack of fieldwork, the population decline is difficult to quantify. <br/><br/>The factors affecting the Northern Long-nosed Armadillo warrant a precautionary assessment of Near Threatened, as it almost qualifies for listing under criteria A2cd and A3cd due to declines in habitat quality and quantity, as well due to estimated levels of exploitation, over three generations (suspected to be around 12 years). Among others, estimates suggest that about 10% of its natural habitat are subjected to land use change per year, and projections indicate that the area used for biofuel, timber and food production in the range of this species will increase more than ten-fold over the next decade.

It is thought likely that this species almost qualifies for a threatened category under criterion A2d due to ongoing exploitation levels, which have led to a decline in the order of 20% over three generations (suspected to be around 12 years).","This solitary species is found in desert, xeric grassland and shrubland, and Patagonian steppe habitats, always with sandy soils (including volcanic soil; Superina 2008). It can be found in some degraded habitats, such as pastureland and plantations. Animals have a relatively large home range within their arid habitat. Reproduction is restricted to the Spring months (Superina and Jahn 2009), and the female gives birth to one or two young (Superina <em>et al</em>. 2009). <em>Zaedyus pichiy </em>is the only armadillo species known to hibernate during the cold season (Superina and Boily 2007). It can enter torpor during periods of environmental stress (Superina and Jahn 2013).<br/><br/>It is not possible to determine their age once they reach adult size, and long-term population studies on pichis are lacking. Therefore, there are no data on the longevity, survival rates, or reproductive rates of wild pichis. Data from captive animals in Argentina show that females reach sexual maturity at 9-10 months of age, but that some females do not breed until their second year (Superina <em>et al</em>. 2009).

In southern Morocco, it was found in areas without any <em>Acacia</em>, but with dense shrub cover (Cuzin 2003).","The main threats to this species include uncontrolled hunting (by nomads, military and others) and habitat loss and degradation due to overgrazing by domestic livestock and the expansion of livestock rearing due to construction of bore wells that allow grazers to remain in a location all year-round. Prolonged drought is also having an impact on pasture quality (Lafontaine <em>et al.</em> 2005, Scholte 2013).","Numbers of Dama Gazelle have declined drastically since the 1950s and 1960s.

There are historical reports of Dama Gazelle from extreme S Libya, which may represent movement of animals northwards from the Tibesti mountains, but no recent evidence (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014).<br/><br/>South of the Sahara, Dama Gazelle have been recorded across the sahel zone from northern Senegal to Sudan (Scholte 2013, and references therein). They formerly occurred in Senegal during the dry season, or periods of drought, only and are thought to be extinct in Mauritania, and from the Sahel zones of NE Nigeria and N Burkina Faso where they have been previously recorded, albeit rarely (Scholte 2013). There are no recent confirmed records from the Sudan, although East (1999) mentioned it could still occur at low densities in Northern Darfur and Northern Kordofan.<br/><br/>Since 2000, Dama Gazelles have been reported from only five sites: south Tamesna, eastern Mali (last record 2006); the Air massif and Termit/Tin Toumma N.N.R. in Niger, and the Manga region and Ouadi Rimé Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in  Chad (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014). Much of the former range has not been surveyed in recent years due to  political instability and lack of security, and there is a very slight  possibility that small groups may persist elsewhere. Unconfirmed local reports suggest that small populations may exist in  two other locations, but as Dama Gazelles make  long-distance movements, ‘new’ small groups may represent nomads not  separate subpopulations&#160;(RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014).","Dama Gazelles are subject to direct exploitation, exacerbated by the introduction of modern firearms and 4x4 vehicles. As well as hunting by nomads and military, hunting of Dama Gazelle by Arab hunting parties has been frequent in Sudan (Cloudsley and Thompson 1992) and in 1998 and again in 2001 in Chad, where it was temporarily, halted after publicity by a local NGO (Scholte 2013).

Populations in Zambia are reportedly stable so the overall decline in the global population over three generations is suspected to be closer to 25%, thus approaching the criterion A2acd threshold for the Vulnerable category. The species is assessed as Near Threatened, however the situation requires close monitoring and further decline in the Kilombero population or the main populations in Zambia could soon result in the species meeting the threshold for Vulnerable.","Puku are obligate grazers, occupying grasslands near permanent water within the savannah woodlands and floodplains of south-central Africa. Although associated with wet areas and swamp vegetation, Puku avoid deep standing water, and in that sense are ecologically distinct from Lechwe (Jenkins 2013). The high population growth rate of Puku has been suggested to explain the rapid recovery of some populations following cessation of unsustainable poaching levels (Goldspink <em>et al.</em> 1998).","Habitat fragmentation caused by expanding human settlements and cultivation is a major threat to Puku populations. The social/breeding system is particularly vulnerable to disruption by habitat fragmentation and hunting with the longer term impact of a collapse of population recruitment (Jenkins 2013). In the Kilombero Valley, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> (2002) reported that the major threat to Puku came from the expansion of cattle herds onto the floodplain boundary and damage to wet season habitat by farmers who cleared miombo woodland.&#160;Unsustainable hunting and especially heavy poaching appear to have extirpated Puku at sites across their range (East 1999).","East (1999) estimated the total population size at 130,000. A recent aerial survey of the Kilombero Valley, containing Africa's largest Puku population, employed two complementary methods to assess the population size. When surveyed using the same methods as used on previous counts, the population was estimated as 23,301± 5,602 SE, a notable decrease from the previous estimates of 55,769 ± 19,428 SE in 1989 and 66,964 ± 12,629 in 1998. However, a more intensive survey was also undertaken (using 2.5 km transect spacing as opposed to 10 km) specifically to count the Puku and this resulted in a population estimate of 42,352 ± 5,927 SE (Jenkins 2013, and references therein). These figures indicate a decline in Kilombero of 37% in a period (15 years) equivalent to less than three generations (19 years).<br/><br/>The small population in the Selous G.R. has been extirpated. The population of Puku on the floodplains along the Chobe River was believed to be in decline since the last census in 1965-1967; however, the population has shown a strong increase in numbers compared with the 1960s, although the concentration of the population has shifted eastwards (Dipotso and Skarpe 2006).<br/><br/>There are no precise estimates for the populations in Zambia, but they are reportedly stable.",Decreasing,"The Puku (<em>Kobus vardonii</em>) formerly occurred widely in grasslands near permanent water within the savannah woodlands and floodplains of south-central Africa. It has been eliminated from large parts of its former range and reduced to fragmented, isolated populations, but some of these are still numerous. Large numbers now occur in only two countries, Tanzania and Zambia (East 1999, Jenkins 2013). Populations of Puku still occur in north-east Botswana on the Chobe River floodplain (Dipotso and Skarpe 2006), and they occur as vagrants in the middle Zambezi valley of Zimbabwe and the eastern Caprivi strip of Namibia (Jenkins 2013). In Zambia around 85% of Puku occur in protected areas.","Puku are relatively easy to approach during the dry season, when densely aggregated on floodplains, and are consequently very vulnerable to hunting. Levels of offtake by local people are difficult to determine, but are likely to be high in areas near to human settlements (Jenkins <em>et al. </em>2002), because Puku is a highly desired source of meat and also a valuable non-food resource (the skin is used for drums and furniture).

Water is  an essential requirement and they stay within 1.5 km of surface water  during the dry season.<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are adapted to unique  habitat and climatic conditions: the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion  receives some rain throughout the year but has a distinct peak during  winter with about 65% of rain falling between April and October. This  subspecies has thus adapted over at least 20,000 years to a climate of  wet and cold winters and warm and dry summers, the opposite to the  conditions experienced by <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> with warm and wet  summers and very cold but dry winters.<br/><br/>For further detail see the subspecies accounts.","The translocation of both Blesbok and Bontebok outside their natural range is a significant threat to the continued existence of the two subspecies, as hybridisation takes place and becomes increasingly likely. <br/><br/>The major threats for <em>D. p. pygargus</em> are hybridisation with <em>D. p. phillipsi,</em> the lack of available habitat within the natural range, low genetic diversity (probably the result of two bottlenecks caused by overhunting and disease; van der Walt <em>et al</em>. 2001) and poor gene flow between subpopulations. The overall management concern is the lack of a metapopulation management strategy for this subspecies.<br/><br/>Hybridisation is currently a priority issue in <em>D. p. pygargus</em>, but the extent of hybridisation in the <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> population is currently unknown and further research is required. Breeding of colour variants that may be associated with deleterious mutations may, if released in large numbers, reduce effective population size and can affect wild populations if carriers are released into formally protected areas.","East (1999) estimated there to be at least 235,000-240,000 Blesbok (stable or increasing), of which 97% occur on private farms and 3% in protected areas, and at least 2,300 Bontebok (increasing). <br/><br/>Currently, the total population of <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> is estimated to be at least 77,751 animals (2010–2016 counts) on 678 protected areas and wildlife ranches, equating to 54,426 mature individuals using a 70% mature population structure. On formally protected areas, there were at least 17,235 animals counted between 2013 and 2016 (EWT unpubl. data). <br/><br/>For <em>D. p. pygargus</em> the population in all formally protected areas and private ranches within both the natural and benign introduction range is estimated at 752–1,618 mature individuals. However, this estimate does not account for hybridisation which might reduce the number of eligible private subpopulations dramatically. Outside the natural and benign introduction range, there are an observed 4,857 individuals which are not included in this assessment as they are not considered free-ranging (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).",Increasing,"Blesbok is endemic to southern Africa. Historically, <em>Damaliscus pygargus pygargus</em> ranged across the Highveld grasslands of South Africa in the Free State and Gauteng provinces, extending into northwestern KwaZulu-Natal, and through parts of the Karoo in the Eastern and Northern Cape. <em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi</em> is endemic to the Western Cape, the ranges of the two forms separated by over 300 km (Skinner and Chimimba 2005).<br/><br/>Range and population were reduced by hunting in the 19th century but populations of <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> have recovered remarkably, especially on private land, and have been relocated across South Africa to regions both within and outside its indigenous range (for example, Power 2014). Formerly present in western Lesotho, but hunted to extinction before 1900 (Lynch 1994). Swaziland is outside the historical range, but extralimital introductions have occurred in Malolotja Nature Reserve and Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary (Monadjem 1998). The species has also been introduced to private game farms outside its indigenous range in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia (East 1999).<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are endemic to the Western Cape, South Africa, although introductions have been made in most provinces. Historically, they were confined to the coastal plain east of the Kogelberg in the Western Cape where they are believed to have concentrated on the renosterveld areas (Boshoff and Kerley 2001, Skead 2011). Extra-limital subpopulations have been established on private farms or ranches in at least the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West provinces, and there is pressure to increase the extent of introduction (Power 2014).","Used for commercial trophy hunting on a national and international scale, and by subsistence hunters for meat. They are also sold as live animals at game auctions. <em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi</em> are culled for management purposes and commercially for meat. They have also recently been bred intensively for colour variants. <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> are a flagship, endemic species for South Africa’s Highveld grasslands, and are a valuable component of South Africa’s commercial hunting industry. <em>Damaliscus p. pygargus </em>are a flagship subspecies of the Cape Floristic Region, particularly renosterveld, and can be used in ecotourism ventures.",Terrestrial,"The Bontebok <em>D. p. pygargus</em> is listed in CITES Appendix II. <br/><br/>This species occurs within a number of formally and privately protected areas across a number of provinces in South Africa. The economic value and popularity of<em> D. p. phillipsi</em> on private farms has enabled this subspecies to re-occupy large areas of its original range and substantial extra-limital subpopulations have also been established on private land outside its natural range in South Africa and elsewhere. Identification of hybrid populations and the restrictions on movement of hybrids are recommended as key actions to conserve the subspecies.<br/><br/>For <em>D. p. pygargus</em>, key protected areas include Bontebok National Park (genetically certified pure subpopulation within the natural range); Table Mountain National Park (genetically certified pure subpopulation within the benign introduction range); De Hoop Nature Reserve and Denel Overberg Test Range (largest subpopulation within the natural range); and Agulhas National Park (potential for significant subpopulation growth within the natural range).

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the various subpopulations results in a total of more than 195,000 whales. Given that there are no estimates for most of the Russian High Arctic, total abundance is likely more than 200,000. At least four subpopulations number more than 20,000 individuals. Some subpopulations are reduced below historical levels and some small subpopulations are declining but data are not adequate to assess overall population reduction or trend. As a species, Beluga Whales do not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and are listed as Least Concern.</p>  <p>Belugas in Cook Inlet have been assessed by IUCN as a separate subpopulation and are classified on the Red List as Critically Endangered (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several other subpopulations are small, declining, and/or occupy restricted areas, and warrant Red List assessment at the subpopulation level.</p>","Belugas are relatively well-studied as a result of carcass sampling conducted in association with hunting (Heide-Jørgensen and Teilmann 1994, Suydam 2009) along with a considerable amount of satellite-linked radio-tracking (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005), and aerial survey efforts (Moore, 2000, Belikov and Boltunov 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/> Belugas occupy estuaries, continental shelf and slope waters, and deep  ocean basins in conditions of open water, loose ice, and heavy pack ice  (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). In summer, they are found in coastal waters as shallow as 1–3 m deep and also in offshore waters thousands of meters deep. They typically enter estuaries and sometimes move upstream into rivers; there are records of individuals or small groups ranging hundreds of kilometers from the sea (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Belugas generally prefer to overwinter in areas with light or highly moveable ice cover (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2001, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may occur as fully Arctic subpopulations (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998b, <em></em> 2001; Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or Subarctic subpopulations (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> Some Belugas undertake large-scale annual migrations between summering and wintering sites (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while others remain in the same area year-round, shifting offshore only when excluded from coastal habitat by fast-ice formation (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). Large numbers of migratory Belugas occur along the northwestern and northern Alaskan coast, in the Canadian high Arctic, and in western Hudson Bay. At certain times of the year, those whales migrate thousands of kilometers, in some cases as far as 80°N into dense pack ice (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or thousands of kilometers into the North Water polynya or to the pack ice off West Greenland (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). In some areas, beluga distribution appears to be determined by sea ice extent, with belugas shifting offshore during low-ice years to maintain associations with the marginal ice zone (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Non-migratory Belugas that generally make seasonal shifts in distribution of less than a few hundred kilometers are found in Cook Inlet, Cumberland Sound, Svalbard, and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kingsley 2002, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> While the general features of Beluga Whale habitat can be described for the relatively well-studied subpopulations, the importance of those features is not well understood (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). For example, the summer occupation of nearshore/estuarine waters has been ascribed alternatively to feeding (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1982), to warm water providing a thermal advantage to neonates (Sergeant and Brodie 1969), and to the presence of fresh water and coarse substrates facilitating skin shedding during molt (St. Aubin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993). The relative importance of each of those factors likely varies according to the environmental conditions (e.g., water temperatures and prey availability) specific to each of the summering areas (Frost and Lowry 1990). Similarly, it is unclear why Belugas sometimes move into deep, ice-covered waters (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2016). One potential reason would be to avoid predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992). However, movements into the ice appear excessive for what would be needed to avoid Killer Whales (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and actually could expose Belugas to predation by Polar Bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987) as well as increase the risk of entrapment in the ice. It is possible that Belugas move into ice-covered offshore regions for feeding, primarily on Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), but few data are available to test this hypothesis (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, the associations of Belugas with features such as the continental shelf break and slope (Moore 2000, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be related to biophysical processes that produce good feeding conditions (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/> <br/> Beluga dives may last more than 20 minutes and can reach depths of more than 900 m (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Beluga has a diverse diet, which varies greatly from area to area. Although various species of fish are considered to be the primary prey items (including Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.), Herring (<em>Clupea </em>spp.), and Arctic Cod), Belugas also feed on a wide variety of mollusks (such as squid and octopus) and benthic crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) (Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas throughout their Arctic range (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease. Belugas are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance varies among the many Beluga subpopulations.</p><p>Hunting for human consumption is the biggest known threat to Belugas  across certain portions of their range. The most immediate concerns  relate to continuing harvests from small and depleted subpopulations (IWC  2000). The strong philopatry of Belugas, which causes them to return to  the same estuaries year after year, makes them highly vulnerable to  overexploitation. This behavioural trait is undoubtedly the most  important natural factor that has led to the extirpation of Belugas from  some parts of their range by a combination of commercial and  subsistence hunting (e.g., in southwestern Greenland and some river  mouths in Ungava Bay, Canada). In nearly all regions hunting is now  being controlled by limiting takes to sustainable levels (see  the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section).<br/> </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial reduction in the seasonal extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as changes in timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Belugas occur only in regions where sea ice occurs at least seasonally, suggesting a strong connection with sea ice influenced habitat. However, Belugas from some subpopulations spend many months in open water far from any ice while others spend most of their time in regions with sea ice concentrations up to 90%, indicating that the species as a whole has substantial flexibility in its relationships with ice (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). Belugas that occupy ice covered areas may do so for feeding on abundant ice-associated species such as Arctic Cod (<em></em>Loseto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Changes in the distribution and characteristics of sea ice will result in changes in productivity and prey species types and abundance (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008, Haug <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the potential costs or benefits to Belugas of such changes are not known. Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992) and it is generally assumed that concentrated sea ice provides Belugas some degree of refuge from predation. There is good evidence that Killer Whales are expanding their range in Arctic regions where sea ice has been declining (Higdon and Ferguson 2009, Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Belugas are susceptible to entrapment when sea ice conditions change rapidly and if they cannot escape they may die or be preyed upon by Polar Bears <em></em> and/or humans (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/></p>  <p>Known or potential threats include a variety of human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is allowing increases in the scale and distribution of some of those activities in areas previously covered with heavy ice. Ongoing and expanding oil and gas development, along with commercial shipping, is likely to impact habitats used by Belugas. Such impacts may be especially acute in shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage which traverses much of the summering habitat of belugas in Canada and Greenland (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas such as the Mackenzie Delta, West Greenland, and the Barents Sea are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which may include seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by icebreaking and shipping. Much of this activity is undertaken in the summer months in the same areas occupied by Belugas. In a study of responses of Belugas to icebreaking ships, the whales typically moved rapidly along ice edges away from approaching ships and showed strong avoidance reactions to approaching ships at distances of 35–50 km (Finley <em>et al</em>. 1990, Erbe and Farmer 2000). Expansion of commercial fisheries into new Arctic regions may have implications for bycatch of Belugas in fishing gear and depletion of Beluga prey resources. Construction of dams for hydroelectric development in the Hudson Bay area and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence may have affected Belugas because of their dependence on estuarine conditions (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p> Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants from those sources that are high enough to cause impacts on health (Ross 2000). Threats from contaminants are of concern for Belugas in some areas. High levels of several contaminants have been found in Belugas sampled in the Canadian Arctic (Braune <em>et al</em>. 2005). Studies of the SLE Beluga subpopulation have found that concentrations of both total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated PCB congeners are much higher than in Belugas in the Arctic. Some scientists believe that the increased occurrence of opportunistic bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, gastric ulcers and other disorders in SLE Belugas is evidence of a link between immune system dysfunction and PCB exposure (Martineau <em>et al</em>., 1994). SLE Belugas also have elevated tissue levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants) (Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Belugas are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2005). Significant epizootics have not been recorded in Belugas, but serological screenings document pathogen exposure (e.g., Alekseev <em>et al</em>. 2009) and necropsies find a variety of health issues (e.g., Martineau <em>et al</em>. 1988). Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. (2016) found low level exposure to biotoxins (domoic acid 2 of 15 tested and saxitoxin 1 of 12 tested) in Beluga samples from Cook Inlet. A mass mortality event in summer 2008 in the SLE, which included several Belugas, was linked to an intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium tamarense</em> (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could impact disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p>The global Beluga population consists of multiple subpopulations with varying degrees of differentiation and abundance (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to the lack of sampling, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee organized information on Belugas on the basis of 29 provisional management stocks (IWC 2000), and a recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 21 stocks (NAMMCO in prep.).<br/></p>    <p>Stocks are generally based on nearshore areas (principally fjords, bays, and estuaries) where Belugas congregate during part of the open water season. Satellite telemetry, genetic studies, and organochlorine analyses have shown that Belugas have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2002; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, de March <em>et al</em>. 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Palsbøll <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some stock boundaries overlap spatially and seasonally during winter and during the spring and fall migrations (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014). For stocks that winter in the Bering Sea, limited satellite tracking data suggest that areas used generally do not overlap in the same year, suggesting that Belugas from different stocks have traditional winter ranges that are mostly exclusive (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  <p>While good abundance estimates are available for some Beluga subpopulations, the sizes of others are virtually unknown or only roughly approximated (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Available information is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Okhotsk Sea</strong></p>  <p>Belugas occur in two well-separated regions of the Okhotsk Sea.<em> </em>In the northeastern region, they summer along the coast and in estuaries of Shelikhov Bay and winter along the ice edge of the Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.<em> </em>Based on surveys in 2010, Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated there were 1,333 surface-visible Belugas in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea, resulting in an estimate of 2,666 total whales when corrected for availability bias (animals not seen because they were diving). In the western Okhotsk Sea, Belugas occur in the northern Sakhalin Bay and Amur River region as well as several smaller bays along the Shantar coast (Ulbansky Bay, Udskaya Bay, Tugursky Bay and Nikolskaya Bay.<em> </em>There Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated 4,780 visible Belugas and 9,560 in total. The population trend is unknown in both regions. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Alaska and Western Canada</strong></p>  <p>Five subpopulations of Belugas are known to occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. All five winter in the Bering Sea (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations migrate northward in spring and spend summer and early fall well north of Bering Strait (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bristol Bay, Anadyr Gulf, and eastern Bering Sea subpopulations remain in the Bering Sea south of Bering Strait (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2016, NAMMCO in prep., Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC) unpublished data). </p>  <p>Bristol Bay Belugas have been counted using aerial surveys conducted periodically between 1993 and 2016.<em> </em>Correction factors to account for animals missed were applied to counts made in 2004 and 2005 (Lowry <em>et al. </em>2008) which produced an abundance estimate of 2,887 whales (Muto <em>et al. </em>2016).<em> </em>Similar correction factors applied to the 2016 count resulted in a population estimate of 3,166 whales (ABWC unpublished data). Lowry <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported that counts of Bristol Bay Belugas increased by 4.8% per year during 1993-2005 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–7.5%). The estimate based on 2016 counts was similar to 2004/05 suggesting that the increasing population trend had leveled off (ABWC unpublished data). </p>  <p>Belugas in Anadyr Gulf have never been surveyed adequately. An analysis of Beluga sightings obtained opportunistically during a survey for Pacific Walruses (<em>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</em>) conducted in the western Bering Sea in April 2006 estimated 15,125 Belugas in the area (with availability correction factor applied). However, the survey did not cover all areas known to be used by Anadyr Belugas, and it is possible that individuals from other subpopulations were also in the survey area. The maximum count along the coast in Anadyr Bay was 241 whales, and expert opinion suggests that the total Anadyr subpopulation is about 3,000 whales with fairly stable abundance (NAMMCO in prep.). </p>  <p>Aerial surveys for Belugas were flown in the eastern Bering Sea periodically during 1992-2001. Data collected in 2000 were used in distance sampling analysis that resulted in an estimate of 3,497 surface-visible Belugas in the survey area. The total abundance estimate was 6,994 whales (95% CI 3,162-15,472) when a correction factor for availability was applied (Lowry <em>et al</em>. in press). There are currently no data with which to estimate population trend, but another survey of the subpopulation was conducted in 2017. </p>  <p>Early estimates of the size of the eastern Chukchi Sea Beluga stock relied on June-July counts of whales in and near coastal lagoons with correction factors applied to account for animals missed.<em> </em>Those studies resulted in abundance estimates of roughly 2,000-4,000 whales (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1988, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>Subsequent tagging of whales with satellite depth recorders (SDRs) showed that during summer they had a very broad distribution, including considerable time spent in offshore areas where they were missed during coastal lagoon surveys (Suydam 2009). Further analysis of SDR data from eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea Belugas (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014) showed there is a date range and region where data from offshore marine mammal surveys (Aerial Surveys of Alaskan Marine Mammals (ASAMM); Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2013) could be used to estimate abundance of the eastern Chukchi subpopulation.<em> </em>That analysis (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2017) estimated there were 5,547 (CV 0.22) surface-visible Belugas in the study area in 2012. Data from SDRs were used to develop correction factors to account for animals that were missed because they were outside of the study area or diving too deep to be seen, resulting in a total abundance estimate of 20,752 whales (CV 0.70). Trend in abundance is unknown but there are several other years of ASAMM survey data that could be analyzed to look for changes over time. <br/></p>  <p>The most recent estimate of abundance for the eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga stock is 39,258 whales (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>This number was derived from aerial surveys conducted in the Mackenzie Delta and eastern Beaufort Sea in 1992 that estimated 19,629 (CV 0.23) surface visible Belugas (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 1996) and a correction factor to account for submerged whales.<em> </em>Synoptic surveys for Belugas were conducted in the region only in 1992, but Beluga sightings were recorded during offshore Bowhead Whale (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) surveys in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 2007-09. The number of Belugas counted at the surface was substantially higher during the 2007-09 surveys but it is unclear whether this was due to a shift in distribution or population increase (Harwood and Kingsley 2013). <br/></p>  <p>An isolated subpopulation of Belugas occurs in Cook Inlet, Alaska where they reside throughout the year (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Sightings are occasionally made outside of Cook Inlet in the Gulf of Alaska (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2000), and there is a small group (&lt; 20 animals) that is apparently resident in Yakutat Bay approximately 600 km to the east (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is considered to be part of the Cook Inlet stock (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Beluga abundance in the Inlet, including corrections for availability and sightability, is determined using aerial counts and video analysis of whale groups (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2000). The 2014 survey produced an estimate of 340 whales (CV 0.08; Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<em> </em>Abundance declined by nearly 50% between 1988 and 1994, and by about 1.3%/year during 1994-2014 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Canada and Greenland</strong></p><p>There are currently three main population centers for Belugas in Arctic Canada, High Arctic-Baffin Bay (HA-BB), Cumberland Sound, and Hudson Bay. A subpopulation that once occurred in southwest Greenland in winter is likely extirpated (NAMMCO in prep.). HA-BB Belugas summer mostly in nearshore waters around Somerset Island (Koski and Davis 1980, Smith and Martin 1994) and winter in northern Baffin Bay and off West Greenland (Doidge and Finley 1993, Heide-Jørgensen and Laidre 2004). An aerial survey of the Canadian High Arctic in summer 1996 produced an availability-adjusted abundance estimate of 21,213 whales (95% CI 10,985-32,619; Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>A 2012 winter survey off West Greenland resulted in a corrected estimate of 9,072 Belugas (CV 0.32) (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling by Innes and Stewart (2002) indicated a major decline in HA-BB Beluga abundance occurred between 1981 and 1994.<em> </em>Current trend in abundance is unknown. </p>  The Cumberland Sound Beluga subpopulation remains in the Cumberland Sound area throughout the year (Richard and Stewart 2008). Aerial surveys were conducted in typically used portions of the Sound in 2014, and abundance was estimated using a combination of visual surveys and photographic counts.<em> </em>The total abundance estimate (corrected for availability bias) was 1,151 whales (95% CI 761–1,744; Marcoux <em>et al</em>. 2016). Marcoux and Hammill (2016) constructed a model of this subpopulation using survey data collected during 1980-2014 and harvest data for 1920-2015.<em> </em>Results indicated that current abundance is substantially reduced compared to 1960 and that abundance is still declining.          <p>Four Beluga stocks occur in the Hudson Bay region.<em> </em>The eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and western Hudson Bay (WHB) stocks summer in the regions for which they are named and winter principally in Hudson Strait (NAMMCO in prep.). Although some interbreeding occurs on the wintering grounds (Turgeon <em>et al</em>. 2012), genetic studies show that the two groups are distinct (deMarch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Colbeck <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that cultural transmission of migration routes exists which likely acts to minimize interchange between the groups.<em> </em>Systematic aerial surveys of EHB Belugas have been flown seven times since 1985. Surveys flown in 2015 produced an availability-corrected estimate of abundance of 3,819 whales (CV 0.43; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling of the series of survey estimates and harvest data for 1972-2016 indicates that abundance declined during 1974-2002, but has been stable since then (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Abundance of WHB Belugas was most recently estimated from visual and photographic aerial surveys flown in summer 2015. The availability-corrected estimate of total abundance was 54,473 whales (95% CI 44,988-65,957; Matthews <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Because of bad weather conditions, this estimate did not include the Ontario coast where nearly 15,000 whales were estimated in 2004 (Richard 2005). A comparison of surface abundance estimates from 2015 and 2004 for five strata surveyed in both years showed that 2015 counts were about 6% higher (NAMMCO in prep.). Belugas use James Bay in large numbers during the summer and remain in that region during winter (Bailleul <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> </em>The 2015 aerial survey estimated availability-corrected abundance as 10,615 (CV 0.25; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Estimates from similar surveys conducted from1985 to 2011 ranged from 4,720 to 19,439 whales so the trend in abundance is unclear. Belugas were once abundant in Ungava Bay, with summer aggregations in and near several rivers.<em> </em>Numbers are now greatly diminished with no animals sighted on-transect during aerial surveys conducted there since 1983 (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>However, some Belugas still occur occasionally in the area as indicated by off-transect sightings during aerial surveys (Kingsley 2000) and land-based sightings (Doidge <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using data from surveys conducted during 1985-2008, Doniol-Valcroze and Hammill (2012) estimated Ungava Bay Beluga abundance to be 32 individuals (95% CI 0-94).   </p><p>&#160;A relict subpopulation of Belugas occurs in the Saint Lawrence River estuary (SLE) that is isolated from all other subpopulations both geographically and genetically (Brown Gladden <em>et al</em>. 1999; de March and Postma 2003). Both the core range used in summer and the total range of SLE Belugas have shrunk considerably since the 1930s (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2010). The size of the SLE subpopulation is believed to have declined from 7,800 whales in the 1866 to about 1,000 in 1985 (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em> </em>Abundance has been monitored since 1988 using photographic aerial surveys.<em> </em>An integrated population model using survey counts and vital rates indicated that abundance increased slowly between the 1960s and early 2000s then declined to an estimated 889 in 2012 (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Svalbard and Russian Arctic </strong></p>  <p>The Svalbard Beluga subpopulation is geographically isolated and genetically differentiated from subpopulations to the east and west (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2010). During the ice-free season Belugas in the archipelago are found very nearshore, often at the faces of glaciers (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>During winter, sea ice formation causes them to move offshore somewhat but they remain in the Svalbard area (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>Currently there is no abundance estimate for Svalbard Belugas but the first ever survey was to be conducted in summer 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>The Beluga subpopulation in the White Sea is genetically differentiated from other subpopulations (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>In summer, the whales are seen in several aggregation areas in the major bays (Andrianov <em>et al</em>., 2009, Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Alekseeva <em>et al</em>., 2012). While some investigators believe that in winter Belugas move to the Barents Sea, they are seen in the White Sea in March (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and all of the Belugas tracked with satellite-linked tags have stayed in the White Sea (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2012, Svetochev and Svetocheva 2012, Kuznetsova <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aerial surveys for belugas were flown in the White Sea in July six times during 2005-2011. The abundance estimate for 2011 was 5,593 whales (CV 0.14), and estimates from prior years ranged from 5,009 to 7,464 (Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012a). Available data suggest that abundance is stable. <br/></p>  <p>Belugas have been recorded at many other locations along the Arctic coast of Russia, including the Kara, Barents, Laptev, and East Siberian seas as well as Nova Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964, Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012b). A compilation of observations made during 1958-1995 from sea ice reconnaissance flights showed many sightings in coastal and offshore waters from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea but few observations in the East Siberian Sea (Belikov and Boltunov 2002). Boltunov and Belikov (2002) considered that the primary summer habitats are near Franz Josef Land and in the Kara Sea and western Laptev Sea, and that most of Belugas from this region winter in the Barents Sea. There are no estimates of current abundance, but given the size of the area and the number of animals taken by historical whaling (Boltunov and Belikov 2002), it is likely that Belugas were once numerous there.<em></em><br/></p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p>Summing the various estimates above gives a total of approximately 195,000 Belugas in the surveyed subpopulations. Because no abundance estimates are  available for Svalbard and the Russian High Arctic and the estimate for the White Sea is not corrected for availability, it is nearly certain that total rangewide abundance is more than 200,000. Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) calculated that in a pristine Beluga population 68% of all individuals would be mature. Using that value the total number of mature Belugas is estimated at about 136,000. The number of mature Belugas in the largest subpopulation, WHB, is about 37,000.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Generation time is an important parameter for several of the IUCN Red List criteria, and calculations of generation time require an accurate method for determining or estimating ages of individuals. For Beluga Whales, this has been done primarily by counting layers in the teeth of harvested or stranded animals. Counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) have usually been converted to age in years assuming there were two GLGs formed each year (Brodie 1971, Sergeant 1973, Burns and Seaman 1988, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Formation of two GLGs per year was supported by examination of teeth from captive, known age, individuals (Brodie 1982, Goren <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2006) measured the incorporation of atomic bomb radiocarbon into Beluga tooth GLGs, and used those measures to estimate age. When those estimates were compared to ages based on formation of one GLG versus two GLGs/year, the data fit the one GLG/year assumption. Lockyer <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined 10 teeth from captive Belugas and found clear support for one GLG/year in six of the specimens, but results for the others were equivocal.  Hohn <em>et al</em>. (2016) considered that the bomb radiocarbon study and long-term photoidentification studies showed that GLG deposition is “unquestionably annual.” (also see Matthews and Ferguson 2014). However, Brodie <em>et al</em>. (2013) continued to argue for two GLGs/year, based on field observations of Beluga life history parameters in Cumberland Sound, captive animal studies, and suggested problems with studies that support one GLG/year. Using the assumption of two GLGs/year, Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated generation time for belugas as 16.4 years for a population in a pre-disturbance state. If one GLG/year is actually the case, generation time would be much longer, but calculations using that assumption have not been done.</p><span lang=""EN-CA""><p>Data on historical sizes of Beluga subpopulations are sparse. Innes and Stewart (2002) estimated the historical carrying capacity (K) of the HA-BB  subpopulation as 39,790 whales. Bettridge <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated K for Sakhalin - Amur Belugas as between 13,200 and 20,800. Cumberland Sound Belugas were estimated to number 3,100 in 1960 (Marcoux and Hammill 2016). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated that there were 6,663 Belugas in EHB in 1974. Abundance of                    Cook Inlet Belugas  in 1979 was estimated at 1,293 (NMFS 2003). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated that there were 7,800 Belugas (standard error 600) in the SLE in 1866. Comparing these figures with those for the most recent abundance estimates given above suggests a reduction of 88% for SLE belugas, and 28-74% for the other five subpopulations. While these comparisons show that some stocks have been substantially depleted and remain in that state, a species-wide reduction in abundance cannot be calculated. The difficulty of such a calculation is compounded by the lack of agreement on calibration of tooth layers for age estimation, which is central to determining generation length and the amount of depletion over time. The combined abundance of those six subpopulations known to be depleted constitutes less than 20% of the current species-wide abundance estimate, and there is no reason to think that all of the remaining subpopulations are similarly depleted.    </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>",Unknown,"<p>Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. (1964) correctly noted that “The Beluga is widely distributed throughout the northern seas.”<em> </em>More recent and more detailed mapping (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014) confirms that Belugas are widely distributed in Arctic regions, occurring nearly throughout northern waters of Russia, Alaska, Canada, West Greenland, and Svalbard. Gaps in the distribution occur off North and East Greenland and perhaps in central Russia. Sightings and telemetry studies show that Belugas occur north of 80° N latitude at Svalbard (Vacquié-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017), and north of western Russia (Belikov and Boltunov 2002) and Alaska (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>Subpopulations in the Okhotsk Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence occur in Subarctic waters as far south as 50° N (Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2010) and 47° N (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2012) respectively. Belugas have been recorded as vagrant at Japan, New Jersey and Washington State USA, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Rice 1998).</p>","<p></p><p>In the past Belugas were hunted commercially at several locations but that is no longer the case. They are legally hunted for food by indigenous communities in several parts of their range, including western and northern Alaska (Frost and Suydam 2010), western and eastern Canada (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2017), some parts of Russia (D. Litovka pers. comm.), and Greenland (Heide-Jørgensen and Rosing-Asvid 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Legally-harvested Beluga products may be sold in Alaska Native communities. Some illegal hunting may also occur, particularly in parts of Russia (NAMMCO, in prep.). Russia allows Belugas in the White Sea and in the Sakhalin Bay - Amur River delta region to be live-captured for public display.<em> </em>Numbers taken in the White Sea are small (probably 5-6 or fewer per year, NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>The number live-captured at Sakahlin is more substantial, 0-81 per year during 2000-2017 (Shpak and Glazov 2014, NAMMCO, in prep.). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated the sustainable annual removal of Belugas from the Sakhalin subpopulation to be 29 whales. Records of historical kills were used in a population model to estimate that the Sakhalin - Amur subpopulation meets the definition of depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which disallows imports for live display into the U.S. (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Although Belugas were hunted intensively on a commercial basis for oil and leather in many parts of their range during the 20th century, the only known direct removals at present are for food (subsistence use) and the aquarium trade. The Canada-Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB) is expected to ensure the conservation of shared stocks of Belugas while NAMMCO is a regional management body to which Canada, Greenland, and Norway belong. Catch limits and other recommendations on conservation of belugas are made on the basis of advice from joint meetings of the JCNB’s Scientific Working Group and NAMMCO’s Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic. Catch levels from hunted Beluga subpopulations range anywhere from less than ten to a few hundred animals per year. There is concern that Cumberland Sound Belugas are being hunted at unsustainable levels (NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>Removals from the Bristol Bay, Eastern Bering Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, and Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations are considered sustainable (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). In both Canada (Richard and Pike 1993) and Alaska (Adams <em>et al</em>. 1993), indigenous peoples’ organizations have entered into co-management agreements with government agencies to work on conservation of Beluga stocks. Harvests from the Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulation occur in both Alaska and Canada, and that is managed by an agreement between the North Slope Borough (Alaska) and the Inuvialuit Game Council (Canada).</p><p></p><p>As a species, the Beluga is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the known and surveyed subpopulations results in a total global abundance of more than 170,000 whales, however this does not include Northeast Greenland or the Russian Arctic for which no estimates are available. Ten subpopulations number more than 10,000 individuals, and two subpopulations number more than 35,000. One subpopulation is thought to be increasing, five are considered stable, and for five the trend is unknown. As a species, the Narwhal does not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and is listed as Least Concern </p>  <p></p><p>Across the global range of the Narwhal, subpopulations are of various sizes and subject to differing levels of threats. Due to this variability, some of the subpopulations warrant Red List assessment.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Narwhals spend approximately two months each summer in ice-free bays and fjords of the Canadian Arctic, eastern Baffin Island, western and eastern Greenland, and Svalbard (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). In some parts of this range during summer they may aggregate at tidewater glacier fronts (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). In autumn, Narwhals migrate with the forming fast ice to wintering areas that tend to be deep, offshore, ice-covered habitats along the continental slope (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are highly adapted to winter habitats with limited open water (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). Few other cetaceans use areas with such dense sea ice cover, and Narwhals have remarkable site fidelity to these areas. They may dive to depths of over 1,500 m multiple times per day and spend over 3 h per day at depths of 800 m (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003,<em></em> 2010). A double-platform visual aerial survey over a Narwhal wintering ground in West Greenland found high densities of whales in the leads and cracks of the Baffin Bay pack ice, up to an average density of about 77 Narwhals/km² (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011).</p>  <p></p><p>In the winter, Narwhals feed intensively at the sea floor (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, <em></em>2004; Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a) but some subpopulations may also feed on pelagic prey (Watt and Ferguson 2014). A major portion of the annual energy intake is obtained during the winter. Although there seems to be relatively little feeding activity during the summer, Narwhals apparently feed opportunistically during this time. Narwhal sighting probability in winter in habitats with &lt;50% open water is significantly higher than sighting probability in habitats with &gt;50% open water, suggesting that the animals select for optimal foraging areas in dense pack ice regardless of the availability of open water (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). In the autumn and winter Narwhals are vulnerable to ice entrapments, or sassats, when rapidly changing conditions cause open-water areas used by the whales to freeze over and trap them, sometimes leading to suffocation (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). Calving occurs in spring during the northbound (or in some populations inshore) migration that coincides with the receding sea ice. There is remarkable consistency across Narwhal subpopulations in the types of habitat used, in site fidelity to migration routes and summering and wintering areas, and in feeding patterns (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fish, squid, and shrimp make up the Narwhal’s diet (Hay and Mansfield 1989, Heide-Jørgensen 2009), especially Arctic fish species, such as Greenland Halibut (<em>R</em><em>einhardtius hippoglossoides</em>), Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), and Polar Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>) (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a).</p>  <p></p>","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease (see also Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance among the many Narwhal subpopulations varies. </p>  <p>Narwhals were never the targets of large-scale commercial hunting except for a brief period of several decades of the early 20th century in the eastern Canadian Arctic (Mitchell and Reeves 1981). They were hunted opportunistically by commercial whalers, explorers and adventurers in many parts of their range. At present, Narwhals are hunted only in some indigenous communities in Canada and Greenland – for both human consumption and for ivory (see Use and Trade). In some communities Narwhal carcasses are at least partially used as dog food. The strong fidelity of Narwhals, which causes them to return to the same nearshore areas each summer, makes them highly vulnerable to overexploitation. In nearly all parts of their range, hunting is now controlled by limits on harvest levels that are judged to be sustainable (NAMMCO in prep.) (also see the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section) </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), including changes in the timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015, Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The effects of climate change on Narwhals are uncertain. Broad changes in the ecosystem may influence the distribution of their prey. Narwhals are well adapted to a life in the pack ice as indicated by the fact that there is very little open water in their winter habitat (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005b), and they can be found in high densities in areas with more than 98% ice coverage (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). They spend much of their time in heavy ice and in some areas are vulnerable to ice entrapments where hundreds can become trapped in a small opening in the sea ice and die (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). This occurs when sudden changes in weather conditions (such as shifts in wind or rapid drops in temperature) freeze shut leads and cracks that the Narwhals were using, and such entrapment may be occurring more often as autumn freeze-up occurs later in the year and on an unpredictable schedule (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). When entrapped whales are discovered by hunters, they normally are harvested. Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) are known to prey on Narwhal in summering areas (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the presence Killer Whales in such areas can greatly affect Narwhal behavior (Breed <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sea ice normally inhibits movements of Killer Whales, and Higdon and Ferguson (2009) documented substantial increases in Killer Whale presence in Hudson Bay when sea ice reduction allowed them to pass through Hudson Strait. An assessment of the sensitivity of all arctic marine mammals to climate change ranked the Narwhal as one of the three most sensitive species, primarily due to its narrow geographic distribution, specialized feeding and habitat choice, and high site fidelity (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>Known or potential threats to Narwhals include a variety of commercial human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is facilitating increases in the scale and distribution of those activities. Oil and gas development is ongoing and expanding, and along with commercial shipping is likely to modify and degrade habitat used by Narwhals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas in Greenland and arctic Russia are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which often includes seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by ice breaking and shipping. Finley <em>et al</em>. (1990) found that Narwhals at an ice edge reacted strongly to ice-breaking ships, and Cosens and Duek (1993) concluded that Narwhals would likely be able to detect the high-frequency components of icebreaker noise 25-30 km from the source. Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> (2013) speculated that noise from seismic surveys, at least in some contexts, could enhance the susceptibility of Narwhals to ice-entrapment.</p>  <p>Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants that are high enough to cause impacts on health and reproductive performance (Ross 2000). Organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants have been found in Narwhals in several areas (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2004). At Svalbard, Wolkers <em>et al</em>. (2006) found that levels of contaminants in Narwhals were higher than those in Beluga Whales (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>). </p>  <p></p><p>Commercial fisheries for Greenland Halibut operate in both the Canada and Greenland sides of Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and have done so on the inshore Greenland side for several decades (Treble and Bowering 2002). This fishing overlaps spatially with where Narwhals winter and feed extensively on the target species, Greenland Halibut (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Narwhals are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2006), but significant epizootics have not been recorded. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2001) found a low prevalence of exposure to <em>Brucella</em> spp. in Narwhals sampled in arctic Canada. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2000) found no serological evidence of exposure to morbilliviruses, and speculated that because they are immunologically naïve, Narwhals are at considerable risk of a serious epidemic if they become exposed. Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could influence disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The global Narwhal population consists of about 12 subpopulations with varying degrees of genetic differentiation and geographical isolation (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to incomplete sampling in parts of the range, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee recognized two stocks of Narwhal but noted that there were probably more that were not yet recognized (IWC 2000). A recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids (GROM) hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 12 Narwhal stocks (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>Discrimination and definition of subpopulations are based mostly on nearshore areas (principally fjords and bays) where Narwhals congregate during summer. Genetic studies, satellite telemetry, traditional ecological knowledge, stable isotope values, and contaminant analyses have shown that Narwhals have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (e.g., Palsbøll <em>et al.</em> 1997, Riget <em>et al</em>. 2002, de March <em>et al</em>. 2003, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2013). <br/></p>  <p>Available information on sizes of Narwhal subpopulations is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Northern Hudson Bay</strong></p>  <p></p><p>Narwhals from the Northern Hudson Bay subpopulation summer in northwestern Hudson Bay, particularly in Repulse Bay and in waters around Southampton Island. They winter in eastern Hudson Strait (Richard 1991, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010). The abundance of Northern Hudson Bay Narwhals in 2011, corrected for perception bias (animals that were at the surface but not seen by observers) and availability bias (animals too deep to be seen by observers), was estimated as 12,485 (CV 0.21; Asselin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Richard (1991) reported results of surveys conducted in 1982, 1983, and 1984 that were limited to areas with less than 20% ice cover and his estimates were not corrected for availability. Abundance estimates from Richard (1991) ranged from 1,038 to 1,517 but were certainly biased negatively. A similar survey in 2000 estimated uncorrected abundance as 1,780 (Bourassa 2003). Abundance of this subpopulation is believed to be fairly stable (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Somerset Island</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Somerset Island subpopulation range over a large area in the eastern Canadian Arctic. During summer, satellite-tagged animals were mostly concentrated around Somerset Island and they spent winter in Baffin Bay (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The abundance of Somerset Island Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 49,768 (CV 0.20; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previous abundance surveys were flown in 1982, 1996, and 2002. The corrected estimate for 1982 was 27,656 (CV 0.54; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggests that abundance has been increasing. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Admiralty Inlet</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals from the Admiralty Inlet subpopulation remain in and near the Inlet during summer, and spend winter in the Baffin Bay region (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2012). The most recent abundance estimate for Admiralty Inlet Narwhals comes from aerial line-transect surveys flown in 2013 (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). When corrected for perception and availability biases the abundance estimate for this stock was 35,043 (CV 0.42). Four previous surveys in 1975, 1985, 2003, and 2010 yielded lower mean abundance estimates with wide confidence intervals. Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggested that abundance has been stable. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eclipse Sound</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Eclipse Sound subpopulation generally stay in and near the Sound in the summer, and winter in Baffin Bay (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). The abundance of Eclipse Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 10,489 (CV 0.24; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). A previous survey in 2004 produced a higher corrected estimate of 20,225 with wide confidence limits (95% CL 9,471-37,096; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Baffin Island</strong></p>  <p>The Eastern Baffin Island Narwhal subpopulation summers in Cumberland Sound and along the Baffin Island coast to the north, and winters in northern Davis Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). Abundance in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 17,555 (CV 0.35; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys in 2003 that had similar coverage of the eastern Baffin Island fiord area produced a corrected estimate of 10,073 (SE 3,123) Narwhals in the surveyed region (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010).

That is the only abundance estimate for Smith Sound so there is no information on trend for this subpopulation. </p>  <p><strong>Inglefield Bredning</strong></p><p>This subpopulation of Narwhals summers in Inglefield Bredning which is its major concentration area in northwestern Greenland (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994). Little is known about distribution at other times of year. Abundance of Inglefield Bredning Narwhals in 2007, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 8,368 (CV 0.25; Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Previous surveys of this subpopulation were conducted in 1985-86 (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994) and 2001-02 (Heide‐Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2004) with generally similar results, and abundance appears to be stable (Witting 2016).&#160; <br/></p>  <p><strong>Melville Bay</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Melville Bay Narwhal subpopulation spends the ice-free season in and near Melville Bay, and may spend significant time at the fronts of coastal glaciers that are important habitats for them (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). With freeze-up they move south to the southern part of Baffin Bay for overwintering (Dietz and Heide-Jørgensen 1995). Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the range of Narwhals in Melville Bay contracted over the period from 2007 to 2014. Abundance in 2014, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 3,091 (95% CI 1,228-7,783). Previous surveys resulted in estimates of 5,605 whales (95% CI 1,319-23,815) in 2007 and 2,983 (95% CI 1,452-6,127) in 2012 (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2014). Confidence limits for all three surveys overlap broadly and abundance appears fairly stable (Witting 2016). </p>  <p><strong>Northeast Greenland</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals assigned to the Northeast Greenland subpopulation are frequently seen during May-August in Young Sound (74°N) and along the coast as far north as Nordost Rundingen (82°N; Boertmann <em>et al</em>. 2009). There has been no attempt to estimate abundance of Narwhals in north-eastern Greenland, but surveys of the area were planned for 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.).<strong>&#160; </strong><strong><br/></strong></p>  <p><strong>East Greenland</strong></p>  <p></p><p>In summer Narwhals occur along the east coast of Greenland mostly from about 64° to 72° N, but they have been reported at more than 81° (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994), which means the distinction between Northeast and East Greenland Narwhals is uncertain. Narwhals are relatively common in Scoresby Sound and the Kangerlussuaq fjord (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). They winter in sea ice in the Greenland Sea and Fram Strait, but winter observations are sparse (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Aerial surveys conducted in Scoresby Sound in 1983-84 and from Tasiilaq to Scoresby Sound in 2008 and 2016 resulted in conflicting results, leading to the conclusion (as of summer 2017) that Narwhals off East Greenland are widely scattered and may number fewer than 1,000 individuals (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Svalbard- Russia</strong><br/></p><p>Narwhals that occur around Svalbard and in the northwestern Russian High Arctic have been little studied but they are thought to be widely distributed in low numbers throughout this region (Heide-Jørgensen 2009). Gjertz (1991) described previous observations and catches that were largely west and north of Svalbard. In August 1998, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. (2007) tagged three subadult Narwhals at Svalbard with satellite-relay data loggers and tracked them for up to 46 days. The whales spent time in fiords in western Svalbard, then moved north and east to deep offshore waters north of 80°N. A survey in the marginal ice zone north of Svalbard in August 2015 produced a corrected estimate of 837 (CV 0.50) Narwhals, but this estimate is negatively biased because the study area did not include the whole range used by Narwhals around Svalbard (Vacquie-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are no estimates of abundance for other areas and overall abundance and trend for this subpopulation are unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). &#160;  </p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p></p><p>The sum of the abundance estimates for the 12 Narwhal subpopulations listed above is 173,134. There is no estimate for Northeast Greenland and the figure for the Svalbard-Russia region is known to be an underestimate because only a portion of the known range was surveyed. If 71% of the overall Narwhal population consists of mature animals (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), the minimum number of mature individuals would be 122,925. The number of mature individuals in the largest subpopulation (Somerset Island) is estimated as 35,335. For the six subpopulations for which there is some information on trend, one is thought to be increasing and five are likely stable. </p>  <p>The generation length for the Narwhal was estimated as 21.9 years by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) and as 30 and 33 years in East and West Greenland, respectively, by Garde <em>et al</em>. (2015) using aspartic acid ageing. Using these estimates, three generations is 66-99 years. For most subpopulations, abundance estimates for years prior to 2000 do not exist, so trends in abundance over a three-generation period cannot be calculated.</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p>",Unknown,"Narwhals primarily inhabit the Arctic, including northeastern Canada, northern Greenland, Svalbard, and waters of northern Russia as far east as the East Siberian Sea. Their principal distribution is from the central Canadian Arctic (Peel Sound – Prince Regent Inlet and northern Hudson Bay) eastward to Greenland (Rice 1998). In the Canada-Greenland region in summer, Narwhals spend approximately two months in the high Arctic, largely in bays and fjords; they overwinter in offshore, deep, partially ice-covered habitat along the continental slope (Heide-Jørgensen and Dietz 1995). Narwhals migrate annually between these disjunct seasonal concentration areas, with the migratory periods lasting approximately two months (Koski and Davis 1994, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). Vagrants have been recorded at Newfoundland, the British Isles, Germany, and the Netherlands in the east, and in the Chukchi and Bering seas as far south as the Alaska Peninsula and Commander Islands (Rice 1998).","<p>Narwhals are hunted in Canada and Greenland for human and animal food and for tusk ivory. They supply various staples in the traditional subsistence economy. Today the main products are mattak (skin with some blubber attached) and ivory (Reeves 1993, Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1994, Heide-Jørgensen 1994). Narwhal tusks from Canada and Greenland are sold in specialty souvenir markets domestically and are also exported, either as whole tusks or as carved items. </p><p>In the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012), intense hunting of Narwhals (including associated loss due to wounding and sinking) in Greenland and Canada was described as a cause for concern, particularly given the lack of reliable data on hidden mortality and serious injury (see Finley and Miller 1982). Statistics on the number of Narwhals reported as landed by the hunting communities are available starting in the 1950s for Greenland and the 1970s for Canada (NAMMCO in prep.).​ Data summarized by Shadbolt<em> et al</em>. (2015) for the period 2007-2011 show a mean annual retrieved catch of 358 in Greenland and 621 in Canada. The Canadian catch was unusually large due to 624 Narwhals being taken from an ice entrapment event in 2008. Watt and Hall (2016) presented Canadian harvest data that had been corrected for estimated struck and lost. Those data indicate that the total number of Narwhals killed in Canada averaged 620/year (range 515-768) during 2011-2015. <br/></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Narwhal is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As a result, a non-detriment finding (NDF; analysis showing that the taking and trade is not detrimental to the species’ survival or to maintenance of the species “throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs”) by the Scientific Authority of the exporting country is required for export. This requirement has had the effect of forcing both Canada and Greenland to document catch and trade levels and to provide data on abundance and trends of hunted Narwhal stocks. Negative NDFs were issued for both countries (Greenland in 2005, Canada in 2010; Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015) making exports of Narwhal ivory from several stocks in Canada illegal for a brief period in 2010-11 and leading to a temporary export ban in Greenland in 2006. This ban remained in effect through at least February 2014 despite the fact that new information reported in 2009 indicated that removal levels for at least some stocks in Greenland were sustainable (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). The NAMMCO Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic and the JCNB [Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga] Scientific Working Group meet jointly every other year to review new information on the biology of Narwhals and Belugas, update assessments, and provide advice to the Canada and Greenland governments based, in part, on a catch allocation model designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of removals from the various stocks (NAMMCO 2016, in prep.). Greenland’s annual report to NAMMCO in 2016 (NAMMCO 2017) noted that the NDF for 2016 compared catches and advice for 2013, 2014, and 2015, concluding that, “as a whole, in the period 2013-2015, catches … followed the advice from NAMMCO, JCNB or IWC for all stocks, except Narwhals in Inglefield Bredning, Melville Bay, Ittoqqortormiit and Tasiilaq.”<br/> <br/> The European Union established an import ban on Narwhal tusks in December 2004. This ban apparently was lifted in February 2010 in response to the fact that Greenland had introduced a quota system “based on scientific advice and more accurate population abundance numbers” (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). Importation of Narwhal products into the United States has been prohibited under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act since 1972.</p>  <p>Particularly in the context of NAMMCO (NAMMCO, in prep.) and among non-governmental organizations (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015), there is increasing recognition of the need to improve understanding of the impacts – direct and indirect, individual and cumulative – on Narwhals from climate change and associated changes in human activity in the Arctic (e.g., mining, oil and gas development, shipping, fisheries, tourism).</p><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici<em>&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durant<em> et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003, Mills <em>et al. </em>2004, Cooper <em>et al. </em>2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall<em> et al. </em>2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker <em>et al. </em>2003c, Durant <em>et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir<em> et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis<em> et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe<em> et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al. </em>1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen <em>et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies <em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa,<em> A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel<em> et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for <em>A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase <em>et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50651463,8540,Felis chaus,Least Concern,,2016,2014-06-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Jungle Cat remains probably the most common cat species in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh), where the majority of the global population occurs and despite likely extensive declines in mainland Southeast Asia, where the species is now extremely scarce and largely restricted to remote lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Gray <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), it is unlikely that globally averaged declines are sufficient to merit Near Threatened status. Population declines and range contraction are also of concern elsewhere in the species’ range particularly in Egypt (Glas 2013), southwest Asia (Abu-Baker<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2003), the Caucasus (IUCN 2007), central Asia (Habibi 2004) and parts of Turkey (Ogurlu <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, very little new information has been obtained from these regions since the previous assessment. Nevertheless,<strong> </strong>ongoing collation of records, particularly from South Asia, is needed and evidence of declines, particularly outside protected areas may merit reassessment.<br/><br/>In India, there is evidence of continued, and likely accelerating, habitat loss and ongoing poaching for both skins and, potentially, as a result of conflict with farmers (Choudhury 2010, Chowdhury <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2015, S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). The Jungle Cat's preference for open scrub and grassland in South Asia makes the species more susceptible to habitat loss than cat species which also utilise denser evergreen forests.<br/><br/>The majority of the suitable Indian habitat is classified as ‘wasteland’ which legally eases conversion into any other form of use particularly industrialisation and urbanization – the latter has been identified as a particular threat in India given the pace of urbanisation of agricultural and unprotected forest areas (S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). Hybridisation with domestic cats is also a potential, although unproven, threat. There remains uncertainty as to how the species will respond to habitat loss, and potential interactions with hunting and persecution. Therefore, further research is recommended, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, in order to gather additional data for a more thorough future assessment of the species' likely trends in response to habitat loss. Generally, more information on the species' ecology and status is needed across its range.","The Jungle Cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with the classic rainforest ""jungle"" habitat, but rather with wetlands - habitats with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments - scrubland, and deciduous dipterocarp forest (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Water and dense ground cover can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert (where it is found near oases or along riverbeds) to grassland, shrubby woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Areas with extensive deciduous dipterocarp forest and at least scattered surface water are the species predominant known habitat in Indochina. However, areas such as the Nakai Plateau which support other forms of savanna-like vegetation may support the species. It is probably absent from all closed canopy forests, including rainforest. The species may make use of agricultural areas with a low intensity of human use and which retain patches of scrub (Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2005).&#160;In Iran, the Jungle Cat was found in a variety of habitats such as from plains, agriculture lands and mountains but was mostly found in shrub lands and woodlands (Sanei&#160;<em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;</em>2016). In&#160;the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the favourite habitat of it was reed thickets, thorn bush thickets and thick lowland forests near water bodies (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;An analysis of habitat preferences, from camera-trap photographs, in eastern Cambodia demonstrated a strong preference for deciduous dipterocarp forests with no encounters (c.f. Leopard cat) in other forest types (Gray&#160;<em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Jungle cats have adapted well to irrigated cultivation, having been observed in many different types of agricultural and forest plantations throughout their range, such as sugar cane plantations in India.  In Israel, they can be found around pisciculture ponds and irrigation ditches.  Vereschagin (1959) noted that the Jungle Cat's use of the semi-arid plains of Azerbaijan increased with the development of a local irrigation system and decreased with its abandonment.  However, mowing the seasonally flooded riverine tugai vegetation (trees and shrubs with dense stands of tall reeds and grasses) of this region for livestock fodder, as well as ploughing it under for agriculture, is known to be associated with the decline of Jungle Cat populations in the European-central Asian parts of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>In India, in a study in the Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, the Jungle Cat was mostly active in the night hours (Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>2011), whereas in Cambodia, Jungle Cats were found to be more active during the day (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Jungle Cats feed mainly on prey that weighs less than one kilogram.  Small mammals, principally rodents,  are the prey most frequently found in feces and stomach contents (Adhya 2014, Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). A study in India's Sariska reserve estimated that Jungle Cats catch and eat three to five rodent per day (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004).  Birds rank second in importance, but in southern Russia waterfowl are the mainstay of Jungle Cat diet in the winter.  With overwintering populations of waterfowl congretating in large numbers on unfrozen rivers and marshes, the Jungle Cat hunts among reed beds and along edges of wetlands, searching for injured or weakened birds.  Other prey species are taken more opportunistically, including hares, nutria, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and fish (Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Ogurlu <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002,&#160;Patel 2011). In India, they have been seen to scavenge kills of large predators such as the Asiatic lion.  In a study in southern Uzbekistan, the fruits of the Russian olive made up 17% of their diet in winter.  While Jungle Cats specialize on small prey, they are large and powerful enough to kill young swine, subadult gazelles, and chital fawns (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Density estimates from natural tugai habitat in central Asia range from 4-15 individuals per 10 km², but where this vegetation type has declined due to development density it does not exceed 2 cats per 10 km² (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The biggest threat to Jungle Cat is habitat loss&#160;particularly industrialisation and urbanisation of low intensity agricultural areas and scrubland in the Indian subcontinent. Habitat destruction for agricultural purposes and infrastructure development are also issues in Turkey and Iran (Ogurlu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2010, Sanei<em> <em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). In Turkey, wetlands are mainly threatened by dam constructions and irrigation projects (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014). Additionally, environmental pollution and illegal hunting are threatening the Jungle Cat in Turkey too (Ogurlu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Also in Iran, illegal killing of Jungle Cats by shooting or trapping is a threat (Sanei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2016). Jungle cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Nevertheless, the species' response to urbanisation and degradation of low intensity agricultural landscapes is unclear and merits further research.<br/><br/>Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).  India formerly exported large numbers of Jungle Cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979), and some illegal trade (and killing) continues there (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010), elsewhere in South Asia (Chowdhury <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014) as well as in Egypt (Glas 2013) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004). The scarcity of Jungle Cat in mainland Southeast Asia is likely the result of high levels of hunting in open and accessible deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","In Europe, the Jungle Cat is of marginal occurrence, with small populations in Cis-Caspian region and the Caucasus along the Caspian Sea. The European population has been rapidly declining since the 1960s. There was no records of this species in Astrakhan State Reserve (Russian Federation) since the 1980s. In Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation) only about 150 animals were recorded (Kuryatnikov and Varziev 1983).&#160;In the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the number of Jungle Cats was estimated at 105 animals in 2009, at 216 in 2010, at 177 in 2011, at 110 in 2012 and at 307 animals in 2013, showing population fluctuations (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;Marked population fluctuations are characteristic of this species in this region, probably because of absence of adaptations to cold winters. Despite these fluctuations the long-term trend in Europe is of decline in both population and area of occupancy. Data from Russia suggest that there are about 500 animals left in the wild (Prisazhnyuk and Belousova 2007). A very small population persists in Georgia (I. Macharashvili pers. comm. to K. Tsysulina 2007). This species is considered threatened in a number of range states in Europe and the Caucasus, and is included in the Red Books of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (IUCN 2007). In southwest Asia the species is considered rare and threatened (Abu-Baker&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Habibi 2004). However, the Jungle Cat is considered common in some parts of its range, primarily in India (Mukherjee 1998, Patel 2011), but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2005). Nevertheless, in southern China and southeast Asia, it appears quite rare in comparison to sympatric small cats (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2005).  This rarity appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon associated with unselective trapping and snaring, especially in Lao PDR and Thailand as well, where it was described as common by Lekagul and McNeely (1977) but has since suffered drastic declines and is rarely encountered (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). There are a number of recent camera-trap records from the Eastern Plains Landscape protected area complex in eastern Cambodia (Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and this area likely remains the stronghold of the species outside South Asia.",Decreasing,"The Jungle Cat has a broad but patchy distribution.  In Africa, it is found only in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley south to Aswan, and in El Faiyum, Farafara, Dakhla and Kharga oases (Glas 2013). In Southwest Asia its occurrence is highly localized around riparian vegetation and permanent water sources.&#160;It occurs through Israel, southern Lebanon, northwestern Jordan, western Syria, Turkey, Iraq and into Iran where it is found in the north, from the provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran westwards along the Caspain Sea coastline and Hyrcanian forests to the West Azarbaijan Province (Abu-Baker <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2003, Sanei <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).&#160;In Turkey, the Jungle Cat has a fragmented distribution and seems to be quite widely distributed in the south of the country but to be restricted especially to wetland areas (Gerngross 2014). Jungle cat presence was recently recorded around the Büyük Menderes Delta, Aydin Province, in the Akyatan Wildlife Conservation and Development Area, Akyatan Lagoon, Adana Province, and close to Manavgat, Antalya Province (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014).&#160;However, its status in Turkey is not known (Avgan 2009). The Jungle Cat is found in the Caucasus mountains (up to 1,000 m) including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia. It occurs west and south of the Caspian Sea as well as south and east of the Aral Sea and associated river valleys, In Central Asia, it is found in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, possibly Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan. Its distribution extants into South Asia from western Pakistan through&#160;almost all of India as well as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal ranging up to 2,400 m in the Himalayan foothills. The Jungle Cat occurrs through Southeast Asia including Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos PDR and Vietnam, to southern China, but is absent from Malayan peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Its range in Indochina is poorly known, especially in Myanmar.  Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2005) reviewed the few historical distribution records from Indochina and added several recent ones from Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam.","Some illegal trade (and killing) continues in India (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010) and elsewhere in South Asia.",Terrestrial,"The Jungle Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II.  It is protected from hunting in some range states (India), but in many it receives no legal protection outside protected areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species now receives legal protection from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan after being placed on the country’s 2009 Protected Species List. Furthermore, given the amount of habitat loss occurring in riparian and wetland areas in Afghanistan, this species should be considered a research priority.<br/><br/>The ecology and status of the Jungle Cat is poorly known (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Southwest and Southeast Asia, where it is considered rare and declining, more research needs to be undertaken to gain knowledge of current distribution, both in and outside of protected areas (Abu-Baker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).  Some farmers consider the Jungle Cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), and conservation measures should include better protection for domestic fowl and halting of indiscriminate poisoning and trapping.  The Jungle Cat would also benefit from improved protection of natural wetlands and reedbeds, particularly in the more arid parts of its range, and improved legislation prohibiting fur trade.<br/><br/>The Jungle Cat was recorded in 13 protected areas in Iran (Sanei<em> <em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2016). There are recent Jungle Cat records from protected areas in India as from Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Andhar Pradesh, Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve, Biligri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve, Mundumalai Tiger Reserve and from Mana National Park (Behera and Borah 2010, Borah&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2012, Choudhury 2010, Kalle&#160;<em><em>et al.</em>&#160;</em>2013, Kumara&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014).&#160;In 2013, its presence was recorded in Chitwan National Park, Nepal (Lamichhane <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2014). There are also a number of recent records from protected areas from eastern Cambodia such as from the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Channa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Gray <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014) as well as from Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand (Borries and Koenig 2014) and from the Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar (Linnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> no date).&#160;However, all protected areas in Cambodia are insufficiently managed and threatened by habitat loss, degradation, and hunting.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50653881,54012637,Leopardus tigrinus,Vulnerable,A2c,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> has recently been split into two species:<em> L. tigrinus </em>and <em>L. guttulus</em> (Trigo <em>et al. </em>2013a). The present concept applies only to the former, distributed from North Eastern Brazil through the majority of northern South America to what seem as disjunct populations in Panama and the Central Cordillera of Costa Rica (Hunter and Barrett 2011, Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013a). <em>L. tigrinus</em> and <em>L. guttulus </em>show no evidence of ongoing gene flow, whereas <em>L. tigrinus</em> and Pampas cat (<em>L. colocolo</em>) have not developed complete intrinsic reproductive barriers, which has allowed them to hybridize (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as <em>L. t. oncilla</em> also represents a different species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999, Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2008). <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> is widespread and rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and mist forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannas and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno<em> et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, densities are also very low, typically around 0.01–0.05/km<sup>2</sup> (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, 2013). In the Amazon, the species' occurrence might be marginal and restricted to some small isolated enclaves. The Northern Tiger Cat was absent from all of the extensive camera-trap studies that totalled 56,837 trap-days throughout all of the Amazon Basin and was considered the rarest carnivore there (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. unp. data). Abundance estimates of this small felid are lower than that reported for the much larger jaguar, puma and ocelot, and there is evidence suggestive of population fluctuations or declines of unknown reasons, in some areas, estimated at 10–40% (Oliveira 2011, unp. data). It has been suggested that high Ocelot population numbers negatively affect the Northern Tiger Cat population (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Probably most of the population of <em>L. tigrinus</em> occurs outside protected areas, and outside the Amazon basin lowland rainforest (Oliveira 2011), in habitats which are undergoing variable rates of loss due to habitat conversion to agriculture. Extreme examples include the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga (with losses of 50% or more depending on the source; Klink and Machado 2005, IBAMA/MMA 2011a, CI 2012) and the Brazilian Amazon (with deforestation of more than 20%/10,000km<sup>2</sup>/yr in recent years; Morton<em> et al. </em>2006) and an overall loss of 90% of cloud forest in the northern Andes (Bubb <em>et al.</em> 2004, Garavito <em>et al. </em>2012). Loss of habitats from conversion to agricultural lands is certainly its main threat to survival also in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the deforestation frontier of the Amazon basin. Other threats include retaliatory hunting from depredation on poultry and the skin and pet trade, competition and disease spread by domestic dogs, and road kills (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2013, Marinho 2015). There is also hybridization with Pampas Cat in central/northeastern Brazil, which may be a natural or anthropogenic process whose extent as a threat is unknown (Trigo <em>et al</em>. 2013a). If further taxonomic species splits are indeed confirmed, the sub-populations are to be even smaller.&#160;High rates of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation in Brazil (Klink and Machado 2005, Morton <em>et al. </em>2006) depict habitat suppression, not degraded habitat, which should reflect equivalent species population declines, for example. The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> and <em>L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup> of the total current available habitat (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many Areas; IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). A Population in semi-arid Caatinga scrub/dry forest mosaic area in Bahia State, Brazil, showed an observed abundance reduction of 25.9% from 2012 to 2015 (L. P. de Castro Meira, T. G. de Oliveira, pers. comm.). The decline of the Northern Tiger Cat over three generations was modelled with a maximum entropy algorithm for 52 <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em><span id=""yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466593628142_10605""> records in Colombia and 19 bioclimatic variables and found a 12.7% population loss over three generations for the species (i.e. 15 years). The decline for Brazil, which holds the majority of the species range, was estimated at 36.8% in three generations (Oliveira et al. 2013, MMA/IBAMA 2014). Including a stable population for Central America the&#160;overall reduction&#160;is estimated to&#160;be 31.7%. The species is therefore classified as Vulnerable VU A2c. The overall range-wide population size is estimated to be less than 10-11,000 individuals, the species will continue to decline, and there is a lack of conservation actions destined to the species.</p>","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, from the lowland semi-arid Caatinga to cloud forests in the Andes. In Costa Rica the species is almost entirely confined to montane forests along the flanks of volcanoes and other high mountains from 1,000 m up to the treeline (paramo) and occupy cloud forest and high elevation elfin forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). Their distribution pattern in Costa Rica and Panama closely resembles that of the oak (<em>Quercus</em> sp.) dominated forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). While in Central America and parts of northern South America it may be most common in montane cloud forest, it is mostly found in lowland areas in Brazil, being reported from rainforests to dry deciduous forest, savannahs, semi-arid thorny scrub, in both pristine and disturbed areas. However, the species appears absent in the llanos but present from a few records from Rupununi savannahs in Guyana (Payán pers. obs.). In disturbed habitats, it can occur even close to human settlements, as long as there is natural cover and prey base (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2008). However, Marinho (2015) has shown that the species' occurrence is favoured by denser woody cover and distance from rural settlements in the dry Caatinga of northeast Brazil. Although it can be found in a few and localized areas of the Amazon Basin (Oliveira 2004), the use of lowland Amazonian forests is practically unknown and requires research attention. After an enormous effort of 56,837 camera trap-days, at 12 different study sites throughout the Basin, no record of the species was obtained (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> unp. data).<br/><br/>The Northern Tiger Cat is a poorly known small-sized (2.4 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.12 kittens (1–4) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is mostly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. However, it could also be highly diurnal in some areas of Brazil. <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> diet is still very poorly studied, but is known to be based on small mammals (&lt; 100 g; Trigo et al. 2013b), birds and reptiles (especially lizards). Limited data on home range shows that they are much larger than would be expected by its small body size. It ranges from 1 to 17 km² (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2010). Northern Tiger Cats are typically rare to uncommon, occurring at low population densities throughout most of its range, especially on what would be expected by a felid of its size. Densities are typically 1-5/100 km², but can reach 15-25/100 km² in a few and localized areas where ocelots are either rare or absent (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010). Its numbers/densities are strongly negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intraguild predator/competitor (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2008, 2010; Oliveira 2011).","The Tiger Cats were heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline of the Ocelot trade (Payan and Trujillo 2006). Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, disease, road-kill, illegal trade (pets and pelts), retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2008, 2013; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; Diaz-Pulido <em>et al.</em> 2013; Marinho 2015). By and large, the greatest threat is the rampant rate of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation. In the Andes cloud forests deforestation is mostly due to conversion to agriculture but also includes oil, hydroelectric dams, urban sprawl and road building (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, CI 2012). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, suppression to agriculture is by far the main threat. In these domains the rate is actually higher in the area called MATOPIBA (the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia), where it is twice as high as in the other parts of the country and which also comprises the main and most important area for the species (IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Oliveira 2011). Thus, populations in the core range area of <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>range are getting ever increasingly reduced and fragmented. Change in native species dynamics (predator/competitor) could represent another previously undetected potential threat (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2013). Hybridization with Pampas cat in all of northeast and central Brazil (the main range area for <em>L. t. tigrinus</em>) was detected in 100% of all specimens evaluated. This may be a natural or anthropogenic process and the extent of this as a threat is unknown (Trigo<em> et al.</em> 2013a), but would probably already compromise about 70-80% of the entire species population, or even more. This high level of hybridization is unheard of for any extant cat species.","Relative abundance and estimated population densities vary greatly, and the northern<em> Leopardus tigrinus </em>is less abundant than the southern <em>Leopardus guttulus </em>and also the rarest of the tropical species of Neotropical cat (Oliveira 2011). <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>is rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and cloud forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannahs and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Amazon, density is very low, expected at approximately 0.01/100 km². Camera-trap surveys in other portions of its range indicate that the species generally occurs in densities between 1-5/100 km² or lower (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2010, 2013). In Central America the species rarely shows up in camera traps even where they are known to occur, suggesting that they either avoid traps or are naturally rare and elusive in that area (Schipper pers. comm.). A similar trend is also found in several areas in Brazil, where authors found it in most areas in intrinsically low numbers, and apparently those numbers are not owed to camera-trap shyness (Oliveira pers. comm.). The species was absent from all extensive camera-trap studies in the llanos of Colombia and all of the Amazon, depicting its extreme rarity there (Oliveira, Payán pers. comm.). The Northern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit possibly due to the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). It seems that where Ocelots are rare or absent the average population density of tiger cats ranges from 5-20 ind./100 km² but expected to be much lower than 5/100 km² where Ocelots are present (high density estimates, ca. 20/100 km², are obtained only in very few and isolated areas) (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em> is classified as Vulnerable in Colombia (MAVDT 2005, Rodriguez-Mahecha<em> et al. </em>2006) and as Endangered in Brazil (IBAMA/MMA 2014). The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> and<em> L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km²&#160;of the total current available habitat (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>submitted, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many areas) (IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). Extrapolated population estimation based on the above distribution estimates and also estimated densities (0.01/km²), results in an expected total population size ranging from 8,932 to 10,208 adult individuals. Decline based on deforestation rates of the species’ habitat is certainly above 10% over the next decades (Morton <em>et al.</em> 2006, Mulligan 2010, Garavito<em> et al.</em> 2012). It seems that the savannahs of Mirador State Park and the complex of protected areas around Nascentes do Rio Parnaíba National Park in the Brazilian mid-north and the Andean protected areas in Colombia are the most important areas for the species conservation (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2014; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011).",Decreasing,"The distribution range of the Northern Tiger Cat expands from Costa Rica and Panama in Central America into South America up to Central Brazil. Its southern limits are not yet well known, as well as the extent of a possible overlap with the populations of the Southern Tiger Cat (<em>L. guttulus</em>) (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as <em>L. t. oncilla </em>also represents a different species (Johnson <em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Trigo<em> et al. </em>2008). Additionally, it is also possible that the northern South American population, described as <em>L. t. pardinoides,</em> will also comprise a separate species (Nascimento 2010), or be together with <em>L. t. oncilla</em>. from northwestern South America a clearly distinctive species from <em>L. t. tigrinus</em> (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). There are records from the Amazon basin, but the distribution could be discontinuous and patchy, and the species extremely rare (Oliveira 2004). <em>L. tigrinus</em> has been described as one of the rarest species in Amazonia, being absent in all of the 12 extensive camera-trap studies assessed along all of the basin. Its occurrence there might be marginal and restricted to some enclaves (Oliveira unp. data). The species is absent from the Llanos (Payan<em> et al.</em> 2007) and from the Darien Peninsula connecting Central and South America. From Ecuador and Peru only few museum specimens exist and only in 2000 the species was formally confirmed in Bolivia through live-trapping. Although the Northern Tiger Cat has been collected as high as 4,800 m (Cuervo <em>et al. </em>1986), this is probably an outlier, as there are very few records at or slightly above 3,000 m (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). However, in Costa Rica, in the Chirripó National Park, the species was recorded at 3,625 m (González-Maya and Schipper 2008).&#160;In Colombia it seems to be restricted to elevation above 1,500 m, however in Brazil most of the records were below 500 m (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008). It seems that the bulk of the species' distribution would be the cloud forests of Costa Rica for <em>L. t. oncilla</em>, at 1,500-3,000 m in the northern Andes for <em>L. t. pardinoides</em>, and the dry-lands of the Cerrado and Caatinga domains and adjacent deciduous forest in north-central Brazil for<em> L. t. tigrinus</em>. All other areas seem to be marginal for the species (Oliveira unp. data/in prep.). Although the extent of occurrence is rather broad, the actual area of occupancy (AOO) is considerably restricted, especially because large portions of the high Andes, or of the Brazilian Cerrado (ca. 50%) and Caatinga (ca. 46%) have already been suppressed and converted to agriculture-pasture, where the species is known to be absent (Klink and Machado 2005; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2008; IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; CI 2012). Thus, based on and using the remaining available cover estimates as the expected AOO (and compensating for inclusion of unsuitable areas and the tiny fragments), should be somewhere around 893,200–1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup>, and is continually declining (Morton <em>et al. </em>2006, Mulligan 2010). Additionally, if the Northern Tiger Cat tends to avoid the more open formations and proximity to rural settlements as Marinho (2015) reported for the Caatinga and Oliveira <em>et al</em>. (2014) noticed for the Cerrado, then the ""de facto"" AOO should be even smaller.",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. Hunting of the species is prohibited in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Suriname and Venezuela (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the Amazon, field records suggest that, where found, populations are extremely low - therefore these areas should not be perceived to be safeguards for the species as it is for other felids (Oliveira 2004). It is likely that the species presents only a marginal distribution there (Oliveira unp. data). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of higher Ocelot <em>(L. pardalis</em>) densities, so that conservation of Northern Tiger Cat populations should rely mostly on private lands (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). It has been estimated that possibly only one complex of protected areas could maintain in isolation a minimum viable population of this species (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2008, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). Further studies are required on the species' ecology, demographics, natural history, and threats. This species needs to be evaluated at the subspecies level due to genetic diversity within the species. A reassessment on the taxonomy of this species is an urgent research priority as the northern portion of the population might be a distinct species (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50654216,11511,Leopardus wiedii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Margay populations are declining through much of its range due to human induced conversion of native forest habitats to agriculture, pasture and infrastructure development, and is predicted to continue at a rate approaching (but less than) 30% over the next 18 years (three generations), which qualifies it as Near Threatened. However, several populations are considered threatened. Although the species shows a large extent of occurrence, its area of occupancy is much smaller. In Amazonia, which is often considered a stronghold for the species, estimates suggest that Margay is not as abundant as previously perceived, but rather uncommon (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Additionally, Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelots (through ‘the ocelot effect’), which are fairly abundant and the dominant felid species in most areas of tropical America, including protected areas (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, Margay conservation would concentrate outside protected areas and likely only in Amazonia could long-term viable populations be sustained. In most areas <em>L. wiedii</em> is typically rare to uncommon, reaching densities around 0.01–0.05/km² (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Bianchi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). Over the next 10 years it is predicted that degradation of the Amazon by roads, hydroelectric dams, fire and deforestation will fragment and isolate remaining populations of its main stronghold. Habitat loss and fragmentation in other biomes of occurrence is also impacting the remaining populations, where the species is much rarer than in Amazonia. Protected areas outside of the Amazon are not expected to retain viable populations over the next few years (and likely do not at present) (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). This species will likely qualify for VU A3cde in the near future and should be periodically reviewed.","The Margay is strongly associated with forest habitat/tree cover, from continuous forest to small forest fragments in savanna ecosystems, both evergreen and deciduous, although it has been occasionally reported outside forested areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Oliveira 1998, 2011). It seems to be absent from the semi-arid scrub of the Caatinga domain in Brazil, with the exception of some evergreen forest enclaves (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). This species is thought to be more arboreal and better adapted to live in trees than other cat species. It is perceived as being a little less tolerant of human settlement and altered habitat than its close relatives, the ocelot and tiger cat. Nevertheless, Margay will use highly disturbed forest, abandoned plantations and other agroforestry systems which provide sufficient tree cover (J. Schipper pers. comm., Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Margay is a small-sized (3.3 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.09 (1–2) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Activity pattern is predominately nocturno-crepuscular, with very few records of daytime activity. Prey base consists mostly of terrestrial and scansorial small mammals, but lizards and especially birds can comprise important items at some sites. Larger medium-sized mammals, like squirrels, rabbits, agoutis, and small monkeys are also taken, but to a lesser extent. The average prey size is around 250 g. Although Margay has high arboreal abilities, it hunts mostly on the ground and most prey recorded are terrestrial (Oliveira 1998, Wang 2002, Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Bianchi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).&#160; Given its arboreal capabilities there has been a recurring myth that this cat is either scansorial or arboreal. It indeed possesses several unique arboreal skills, but that does not necessarily make it arboreal per se. In fact, evidence is highly suggestive of terrestrial locomotion and hunting, but nevertheless with resting time notably up in trees (Oliveira 1998, Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The limited information on home range size varies from 1 to 20 km² (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Home range reported for Mexico was 4.1 km² for four males and 1 km² for a female (Carvajal-Villarreal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). The Margay occurs at low population densities throughout most of its range, and its numbers/densities are negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intra-guild predator/competitor (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).","The Margay has been one of the most heavily exploited Latin American cats decades ago. Margays began to appear in international trade at a time of concern over the level of exploitation of the Ocelot, and species of spotted cats in trade were rarely verified. Illegal hunting for domestic markets or for the underground skin trade has been reported to be a continuing a problem in some areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, roads, illegal trade (pets and pelts - animals sometimes enter the pet trade), and retaliatory killing (animals are often shot due to depredation on poultry). Populations, especially outside the Amazon basin, are severely fragmented and are being reduced by habitat conversion to plantations and pasture. The species is susceptible to disease outbreaks (in Tamaulipas, Mexico there is an ongoing threat from disease). In Brazil, populations of the Atlantic forest are more threatened than those of the Amazon (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).","This species is predominantly uncommon to rare throughout its range (Payán 2009, Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Tortato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). In general, Margays occur at densities of 1-5 ind./100 km², but have been estimated as high as 15-25 ind./100 km² in a very few and highly localized areas (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Where Ocelots co-occur in densities &gt;10 ind./100 km², Margay densities are expected to be much lower than 5 per 100 km² (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). The Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit outside the Amazon basin possibly due to the “ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, viable populations are expected to occur mostly outside protected areas or where Ocelot numbers are low. With the exception of the Amazon mega-reserves, it is not expected to be adequately protected anywhere else. Margays are undergoing a continuing decline due primarily to habitat loss to deforestation (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007). Considered Vulnerable in Brazil (Tortato <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) and Argentina (Diaz and Ojeda 2000), Near Threatened in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), Threatened in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2002), and in Costa Rica (MINAE).",Decreasing,"The Margay ranges from the tropical lowlands of Mexico south through Central America and the Amazon basin to southern Brazil and Paraguay (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its southernmost limits reaches northeastern Argentina, north-central Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil and northern Uruguay along riverine forest (Dotta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Tortato <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Its occurrence in the northeastern part of Brazil is restricted to the Atlantic Forest domain (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Tortato <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). It generally occurs from 0-1,500 m, however, it has rarely been recorded up to 3,000 m in the Andes (Oliveira 1994). Although the species has a very broad distribution range, its area of occupancy is considerably smaller.",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. This species is protected across most of its range, with hunting and trade prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, likely because of the impact of the higher ocelot densities, thus conservation efforts should concentrate outside protected areas (Oliveira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Oliveira 2011).

50657011,15310,Leopardus geoffroyi,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Geoffroy´s Cat is listed as Least Concern because it is widespread and abundant over most of its range. This felid typically ranks first in felid abundance in several habitat types such as the dry forests of the Bolivian Chaco (Cuéllar <em>et al.</em> 2006) and of the Argentine Espinal (Caruso <em>et al.</em> 2012), scrublands of the Monte (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2011), relicts of the natural Pampas grasslands (Manfredi <em>et al.</em> 2006), lowland cropland areas of the Andean subtropical forests (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2011), and grasslands of southern Brazil (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Its distribution range is considered to be continuous, but it does not occur in the high elevation areas (above 3,750  m) of the Andes. In the northern and central part of its range, this felid appears to have been favoured by the conversion of sub-tropical forests into croplands, while it seem to be tolerant to some degree of habitat alteration produced by livestock management. A recent expansion of its distribution has been documented in northeastern Argentina (Rinas <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, it is considered rare in Chile, mostly because of its limited distribution in this country (Iriarte <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Vulnerable in Rio Grande do Sul,  Brazil (Almeida <em>et al.</em> 2013). Anthropogenic mortality (e.g. road-kills, persecution due to poultry predation) is intense in several areas (e.g., Pampas grasslands) and potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia <em>et al. </em>2008, Pereira and Novaro&#160;2014). A hybrid zone between <em>L. geoffroyi</em> and <em>L. guttulus</em> was identified in southern Brazil where the two species meet (Trigo <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2013b). These studies are currently indicating a possible natural origin for this event. In this case, this hybrid zone will be considered as an eligible process for conservation, by representing an important part of the evolutionary history of these species. However, specific studies are still needed to confirm this and evaluate whether anthropogenic influences such as human-induced changes in habitat or population densities in these areas could be influencing these hybridization events, and thus constituting a threat to these species by compromising their genetic integrity.","Described as occurring in a wide variety of habitat types of the subtropical and temperate Neotropics, including scrubby woodland, dry forests and savannas of the Chaco, Patagonian scrub, Monte desert/semi-desert, the Pampas grasslands, marshlands, etc. in both pristine and disturbed areas (Oliveira 1994, Pereira and Aprile 2012). It uses both open and closed habitats, but seems to be more associated with areas of denser cover in the predominately open areas of most of its range. Geoffroy's Cat is distributed throughout the pampas grasslands and arid Chaco shrub and woodlands, and up to 3,800 m in the Bolivian Andes (M. Da Silva pers. comm. 2014).  Most of its range is arid or semi-arid (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2006), but it also occurs in wetlands (e.g. Paraná River delta; Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2005).  It is not found in either the tropical or temperate rainforests.  It is sympatric throughout most of its range with the Pampas Cat (<em>L. colocolo</em>).<br/><br/>In a radiotelemetry study in wet pampas grassland of Argentina, Manfredi <em>et al.</em> (2006) found mean home range size from 2.5-3.4 km², with male ranges 25%  larger than females.  In Chile's Torres del Paine National Park, in beech forest, home ranges were larger, at 2.3-6.5 km² for two females, and 3.9-12.4 km² for five males (Johnson and Franklin 1991).  In Argentina's Lihue Calel National Park, Pereira <em>et al.</em> (2012) found male home ranges of 2-3 km²; whereas females occupied areas of 0.2-0.6 km². Home ranges in adjacent cattle ranches scaled up to 4.4 km² for males and up to 3.7-4.9 km² for females. During a severe drought  period in this same area, six radio-collared cats died of starvation when hare abundance fell from 5.6  to &lt;0.8 per 10 km (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Manfredi <em>et al.</em> (2004) found diet to vary by location in Argentina, consisting primarily of small rodent, but including other locally abundant species such as birds.  In Chile, rodents and hares were primarily taken (Johnson and Franklin 1991).  Plains Vizcachas are also prey (Branch 1995).  In southern South America, where Vizcachas have become extinct, introduced European Hares (<em>Lepus europaeus</em>) are the major prey, although densities of both hares and Geoffroy's Cats were observed to decline markedly during a drought period (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2006).  Fish and frog remains were found in the stomachs of Geoffroy's Cats from Uruguay and Brazil (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Bisceglia <em>et al.</em> (2008) found that small mammals were the most frequent prey of Geoffroy´s Cats in Lihue Calel, representing at least the 63% of the food items throughout the year. <br/><br/>Geoffroy's Cat is a small solitary felid (4.3 kg), with an average litter size of 1.5 kittens, and predominantly nocturnal activity pattern. It seems to be the most abundant felid of the temperate Neotropics (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Lucherini <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pereira and Novaro 2014).","Large numbers of pelts were exported from South America for the international fur trade from the 1960s to 1980s, but little trade took place after 1988 and the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix I in 1992 (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Cats are still killed as pests or poultry predators, and these pelts may be seen in local illegal trade. Currently, habitat loss and fragmentation, and retaliatory killing remains as the main threats. Potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia <em>et al</em>. 2008, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014)<br/><br/>During a health evaluation of Geoffroy´s Cats (Uhart <em>et al.</em> 2012) at two different protected areas in Argentina (Campos del Tuyu Wildlife Reserve and Lihué Calel National Park), antibodies to infectious peritonitis, feline panleukopenia, canine distemper virus, feline callicivirus, toxoplasmosis and dirofilariasis were found in tested animals. Adult parasites recovered from necropsied animals and eggs in fresh faeces revealed the presence of various nematode families, including Ascarididae, Trichuridae, Capillariideae, Rictulariidae, Spiruridae and Ancylostomatidae; cestodes from families Taenidae and Anaplocephaliidae and oocists of Eimeriidae (Beldomenico <em>et al.</em> 2005). These results suggest exposure (recent or past) to common domestic carnivore diseases, and indicate a potential risk to these Geoffroy´s Cats.<br/><br/>Human-related mortality accounted for most of Geoffroy’s Cat deaths recorded on cattle ranches near Lihué Calel National Park, with poaching, predation by dogs, and vehicle collision being the main causes of mortality (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2010).","It is relatively common throughout most of its range, although heavy commercial hunting pressure from the 1960s to the late 1980s is believed to have reduced populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species was recently downgraded from Potentially Vulnerable to Least Concern in Argentina (Ojeda <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is considered Rare in Chile (CONAMA 2009), occurring only in small areas in the south and east.  In Brazil, where the species inhabits only the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, it is considered Vulnerable (Almeida <em>et al</em>. 2013), although relatively common and abundant in the pampas (T. Trigo pers. obs. 2014). In Bolivia it is considered the second most abundant felid after the Ocelot (Cuellar <em>et al.</em> 2006).  <br/><br/>Density estimates include:<br/>Bolivian Chaco (Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park ): 9-40/100 km² (Cuellar <em>et al.</em> 2006)<br/>Argentine Monte (Lihué Calel National Park): up to 190-220/100 km² (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2011), including several transient individuals<br/>Argentine Espinal (altered dry shrublands): 45/100 km² (Caruso <em>et al</em>. 2012)<br/>Chile (Torres del Paine National Park) 7-12/100 km² (W.

50657407,15452,Leopardus jacobita,Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent information confirms that the Andean Cat is a rare species, occurring at low densities and with a patchy distribution due to a specialization for rocky habitats.<br/><br/>New records of the Andean Cat in Argentina extended its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and shrub habitats, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2010, Martinez <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, a study of the population genetics of the Andean Cat throughout most of its range (Cossios <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and identified two distinct Andean Cat populations that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs), the highland cats from the previously-known distribution and the newly-discovered population in the Patagonian steppe. Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is an increasing concern in most areas where the Andean Cat is present, due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction, as well as water and soil contamination for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographical distribution (Bennett <em>et al.</em> submitted) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2010) and in northwestern Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (Lucherini and Merino 2008). More recently, information gathered from monitoring Andean Cats and Pampas Cats with GPS collars in north-western Argentina suggests that competition between these two species may affect negatively Andean Cat populations and make them more susceptible to the mentioned threats (Tellaeche 2015).<br/><br/>Based on Andean Cat distribution records an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,530,818 km² was estimated. However, due to the specificity of Andean Cat to steep rocky environments, this area encompasses large areas between sites of records that are uninhabitable. In a preliminary estimation in a study area of 6,863 km² in Patagonia, only 1.4% of the total area was steep rocky areas. Additionally, in a study area of approximately 65,000 km² in Patagonia, only 3% of the cells in a grid size of 10x10 km were occupied, based on confirmed and unconfirmed Andean Cat records (Walker and Palacios, unpublished data).<br/><br/>This estimation can have more than one source of error (for example it uses still unconfirmed records) and was calculated for the Patagonian steppe, an environment that is different from that of the highland habitats in the northern and central part of the Andean cat distribution, where there is a greater proportion of rocky habitat. Therefore, to be conservative we estimated that 10% of the current EOO of the Andean Cat could actually be occupied.<br/><br/>Taking into account 10% of the EOO and the lowest density of 0.018 ind/km² (Huaranca <em>et al.</em> 2013), estimated for a region considered to have one of the most favourable climatic conditions for the Andean Cat (Marino <em>et al.</em> 2011), the total population of the Andean Cat is estimated at 2,755 individuals. Because no information about population structure is available, using a default value of 50% for the proportion of mature individuals within the Andean Cat population, only 1,378 would be mature individuals (see Table 1 in the Supplemental Material).<br/><br/>No information exists on trends with regard to habitat modification or destruction in the distribution area of the Andean Cat; but as early as 2002, the conservation status of the Patagonian Steppe and the Central Andean Puna were considered as Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (V), respectively, with habitat loss and fragmentation the most serious threats affecting their conservation status (Olson and Dinerstein 2002). There is no evidence that this situation has improved; an evaluation of the progress in the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 mentioned that most of the different habitats, including grasslands and wetlands, are still fragmenting and degrading (SCDB 2014).<br/><br/>Mining activities have increased and the associate use of water resources is impacting negatively most of the areas where the Andean cat presence has been confirmed; in the case of northern Argentinean Patagonia, fracking is an additional threat (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Bolivia, mining is a priority activity and mainly situated in the Andean mountain range; extractive mining without environmental precautions is increasing (Ribera 2013). In Chile, mining industry is an important part of the country´s economy and is mainly developed in the northern region, where the Andean cat is distributed and water is a scarce resource. There, the fragile high Andean ecosystems are being degraded and a reduction of the wetlands is predicted in Chile because of the effects of climate change (IEB, CASEB, CCG-UC - CONAMA 2010). In the Peruvian report to the Biodiversity Convention, it is mentioned that in recent years the transformation of natural ecosystems has increased due to changes in land use, particularly by extractive activities such as mining; a trend of transformation, desertification and erosion is mentioned for the fragile wetlands and grasslands in the Peruvian Andes (Ministerio del Ambiente 2014).<br/><br/>Considering the threats to the Andean Cat, the natural fragmentation of the habitat and the increasing trend in fragmentation due to habitat loss and degradation, a continued decline of the population number is inferred.<br/><br/>Based on the available data on Andean Cat distribution and genetic analysis of samples from most areas, 10 subpopulations were identified for the Andean Cat (see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). Three subpopulations in Peru (1=north, 2=west, 3=east); two in Bolivia (4=north, 5=centre east); one subpopulation shared among south Peru, centre west Bolivia and northern Chile (6); one subpopulation shared among south-western Bolivia, centre east Chile and north-western Argentina (7); and three subpopulations in Argentina (8=north centre, 9= centre west and 10=southern west). Although some of these could be connected, more studies and more samples for genetic studies are needed.In the meantime, as a precautionary measure these 10 subpopulations are identified.<br/><br/>The estimate of the number of mature individuals for each subpopulation was made in the same way as for the estimation of the total number of mature individuals of the whole Andean cat species. The area of each subpopulation polygon was estimated using the Minimum Bounding Geometry, Convex hull function in ArcGIS. As these polygons are all occupied areas within the EOO, we did not reduce the area to 10% as we did for the overall range. However, even within these occupied areas, occupancy and habitat use by Andean cats is patchy, and they are constrained to rocky places associated with wetlands and/or shrublands. Thus, considering new detailed information on space use (Lucherini <em>et al.</em> unpublished data, Huaranca unpublished data, Lagos unpublished data), we, estimated that only 40% of each subpopulation polygon is actually used by Andean Cats, and reduced the size of all polygons accordingly&#160;(see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The largest subpopulation is estimated to contain 172 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A further reason for concern about the conservation of this cat species, and for adopting a precautionary approach to its categorization is climate change. According to Bennett <em>et al.</em> (submitted) the current bioclimatic distribution of the Andean Cat is clearly affected by climate change. By 2080, under the scenario A2 (medium to high emissions) the distribution area is expected to decrease between 15 and 30%, depending on the cut-off point used in the distribution model. Parallel to this, the model shows an increase in elevation in the north and central distribution, which puts the species even more at risk, because the environmental conditions at higher elevations do not provide the habitat requirements necessary for the Andean cat (Bennett <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>More studies are needed to confirm the definition of the subpopulations presented here and to improve our estimates of the population size of each one of them, but considering the precautionary principle, the analysis described above supports the classification of the Andean Cat as Endangered.","<p>The Andean Cat is found primarily in rocky and steep terrains, in arid and sparsely vegetated areas of the high Andes above the timberline, and in scrub and steppe habitats within the Andean foothills of Central Argentina and the Patagonian steppe ecological region (Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010).&#160; In general, climatic conditions are extreme with very low temperatures, large daily thermal variations and low precipitation that determine the presence of adapted plants such as bunchgrasses, cushion plants, and low shrubs with small or resinous leaves (Cabrera and Willink 1973). The presence of high Andean wetlands known as “bofedales” and “vegas” is characteristic in the high Andes and are an important resource for wildlife and domestic animals (Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004).<br/> &#160;<br/> The Andean Cat distribution is similar to the historic range of the Short-tailed Chinchilla (<em>Chinchilla chinchilla</em>) and current range of the mountain vizcacha (<em>Lagidium</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> spp.) (Yensen and Seymour 2000), which are its major prey (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008). According to the results of diet studies in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, and compared with that of other Andean carnivores, the Andean Cat occupies narrower niche with&#160; a wide overlap with the Pampas Cat diet (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Marino <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). Rodents constitute the main prey item and the Mountain Vizcacha in three out of five diet studies was the more frequent prey: 52% and 43-53% in southern Bolivia and 44.1% in northern Chile (Viscarra 2008, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Torrico 2009). In a diet study with samples mostly collected in northern Argentina, unidentified small rodents were the most frequent prey (37.3%), followed by the mountain vizcacha 28% (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007); Tellaeche (2010) for a single locality in northern Argentina, also reported that small mammals were the item most frequently consumed by the Andean Cat (93.3% of the faeces), particularly rodents of the genus <em>Phyllotis</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> (found in 76.9% of the samples). Among the Andean Cat prey items, the mountain vizcacha has the greatest body mass by far; consequently it contributes significantly to the Andean Cat diet (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008).<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is thought to be a solitary species, but may be seen in pairs or with kittens during the mating season and after the births of kittens respectively (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em><span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em>. 2004). Mating season, according to local people in Bolivia, is between July and August (Villalba and Bernal 1999); however, it is possible that this period could be much longer, because small cubs have been observed in October and from April to September (Villalba 2002, Villalobos<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. In prep., Lucherini Unpublished data). Two kittens were seen by Villalba (2002), and what appears to be an older single cub by Sorli <em><span lang=""EN-US""><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">(2006).<br/> <br/> Most of the reported sightings of Andean Cats have been during daytime; however the radio-tracking of the first radio-collared Andean Cat in southern Bolivia recorded main activity peaks at dusk or at night, between 18:00 and 23:00 hours (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009); similarly the results of 1,596 camera-trap photos from different localities in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile showed the following proportions for Andean Cat activity: 37.6% at night, 34.4% crepuscular, and 28% during the day (Lucherini <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009). Additionally, the results indicated that the Andean Cat activity overlaps largely with that of the mountain vizcacha, a diurnal and crepuscular species (Galende <em><span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 1998).<br/> <br/> Data on territoriality is absent, however, as occurs with most felids (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), it is possible that male territories are larger than those of females and that there could be a certain degree of territory overlap between the sexes. Because the conditions of the Andean Cat habitat are severe and naturally fragmented, it is probable that territory and home ranges are very large; a radio-tracked female Andean Cat, between April and December 2004, had a home range of 65.5 km² (95% minimum convex polygon: Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""> The Andean Cat is a medium-sized felid; from measures of skins the total length in adults varies from 740 to 850 mm and in sub-adults varies from 577 to 600 mm; tail length is from 410 to 485 for adults and 330 to 420 mm for sub-adults. Only two records on the weight are available, the first from a sub-adult specimen from Peru, which weighed 4 kg (Pearson 1957, García-Perea 2002) and the second is from an adult female from Bolivia which weighed 4.5 kg (Delgado <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2004).<br/> <br/> Andean Cat fur is mainly ash grey with brown-yellowish blotches that are distributed as vertical lines at both sides of the body, giving the appearance of continuous stripes. The tail of the Andean cat is very characteristic. It is very long (66 - 75% of the head and body length), thick and cylindrical, with a fluffy aspect and with 6 to 9 wide rings of dark brown to black colour (García-Perea 2002). The legs also have dark and narrower blotches or stripes, but they don’t form complete rings.<br/> <br/> Apparently the species is not sexually dimorphic in terms of fur colour, but comparisons among Andean Cat skulls carried out by García-Perea (2002) suggest that sexual dimorphism is present. Differences between juvenile and adult specimens were also found, with juveniles having a lighter coloration and more and smaller blotches (García-Perea 2002). Because of these features, sub-adult or juvenile Andean Cats can be confused much more easily with Pampas Cats (García-Perea 2002).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>In the early 2000s the Andean Cat Alliance considered traditional hunting the top threat, followed by prey reduction and habitat loss and fragmentation (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004), four years later a re-evaluation of the threats affecting the Andean Cat, established that habitat loss and habitat degradation are the main current threats; hunting (opportunistic/palliative or traditional) and reduction of prey populations are considered as the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> threats, in order of importance (ACA 2011: Andean Cat Alliance Strategic Plan).<br/> <br/> Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe are altering the Andean Cat habitat. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographic distribution (Bennett<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in progress) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013).<br/> <br/> Hunting by local people who consider the Andean Cat a predator of their small domestic livestock has been frequently reported particularly in some regions of Argentina, Chile and Peru (Iriarte 1998, Cossíos and Madrid 2003, Lucherini and Merino 2008). Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). These cats are also killed by dogs accompanying local shepherds and in north-western Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (C. Tellaeche and M. Lucherini unpub. data). Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.<br/> <br/> Particularly in Bolivia, Peru and northern Chile, the Andean Cat (as well as the Pampas Cat) is considered a sacred animal according to indigenous Aymara and Quechua traditions. Throughout much of its range, dried and stuffed specimens are kept by local people for use in harvest festivals (Iriarte 1999, Sanderson 1999,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004, Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hunting for such cultural practices may represent a significant threat to the species.<br/> <br/> The Short-tailed Chinchilla was likely to have been a major prey species for the Andean Cat, but the species was hunted nearly to extinction for the fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In most of its range, the main prey of the Andean Cat is now the Mountain Vizcacha (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Napolitano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Torrico 2009), which lives in patchily distributed small colonies and has also been reduced by hunting pressure. This may result in a highly fragmented distribution for the Andean Cat. Intra-guild competition, especially with the Pampas Cat, for Mountain Vizcacha prey, could negatively impact the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2003, Walker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2007, Reppucci 2012).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>Until now three population estimates on Andean Cat were carried out. Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2008), based on genetic sampling estimated five individuals to occur in a 25,000 ha area in northern Chile, around the Salar de Surire National Monument, resulting in a density of two Andean Cats in 100 km². More recent estimates based on systematic camera trapping resulted in 7-12 Andean Cats in 100 km² in northwestern Argentina (Reppucci <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011) and in central western Bolivia, a preliminary estimate of 1.8 Andean cats in 100 km² was calculated by dividing the minimun number of identified Andean Cats by the area covered (164 km²) (Huaranca <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013). In the last two studies, densities of sympatric Pampas Cats were also estimated, resulting 74-79 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Argentina and 4.9 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Bolivia. Reppucci <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2011) also estimated the detection probabilities for both species, which were higher for Andean Cat (0.07) than Pampas Cat (0.02). Other studies based mainly on faecal sample collection have found records of the Pampas Cat much more frequently than the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Vidal 2003, Perovic <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2003, Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Torrico 2009, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). All this information confirms that the Andean Cat is much rarer than the Pampas Cat.<br/> <br/> The three surveyed areas outlined above are located within the two regions that are considered to have the most favourable climatic conditions for Andean Cat, and that coincide with those places where a larger number of Andean Cat records have been obtained (Marino<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). In this context, it is expected that Andean Cat density in those areas with less favourable conditions will be much lower.<br/> <br/> A study of the population genetics of the Andean cat throughout most of its range (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em>. 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and two distinct Andean Cat subpopulations,which are latitudinally separated between 26 and 35° S,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">were identified that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs). Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/> <br/> The geographical separation between the northern and southern ESU concurs with the third biogeographic barrier, the South American Arid Diagonal and the separation between the two northern management units coincides with the transition zone between the wet and dry Puna (Cossíos <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em>2012); thus, the authors remark that these three groups of Andean Cat populations could have developed special adaptations because significant differences exist in rainfall patterns over this range.<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Cat has a patchy distribution due to a specialization for naturally fragmented rocky habitats and most presence records are from the central Andes above 3,600 meters in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. However it has also been found at lower elevations in the southern Andes of Argentina at 1,800 m (Sorli<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2006) and more recent records of the Andean Cat in Argentina and Chile extend its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and scrub habitats in Argentina, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Martinez <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 2,200 m in Chile in the Atacama Region (Villalobos<em> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in prep.).<br/> <br/> Within the high Andes the Andean Cat was recorded at an average elevation of 4,236 m in Argentina (Perovic<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2003), above 3,800 m in Bolivia (Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012), between 3,714 and 4,414 m in Chile (Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 4,000 m or higher in Peru (Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007).<br/> <br/> Until the end of the nineties, Andean Cat records were scarce and restricted to southern Peru, southwest Bolivia, northwest Argentina and northern Chile (Yensen and Seymour 2000). Similarly, sightings of this species were very few (Scrocchi and Halloy 1986, Sanderson 1999), and museum specimens were equally few (Garcia-Perea 2002). However in the last two decades the number of distribution records has greatly increased due to the efforts of the Andean Cat Alliance (<a href=""http://www.gatoandino.org"">www.gatoandino.org</a>), a network of specialist researchers.<br/> <br/> Currently the known northern and southern limit for the Andean cat respectively is central Peru (10°13'S), and central Argentina (38°23'S) (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010), but throughout this range the Andean Cat populations are patchily distributed. The results of modelling the Andean Cat distribution considering four bioclimatic variables (annual mean and mean diurnal range temperature, annual precipitation, and coldest season winter), shows the presence of three biogeographic barriers that affect the species’ distribution: i) at the north in Peru that coincides with the Huancabamba depression, known as “Peruvian low” and defines the northern boundary of its distribution range, ii) at the centre in Bolivia, with the “Andean knee”, an extremely arid transition zone between the wet and dry Puna and where there are no records of Andean cats, and iii) at the south with the “Arid Diagonal” in Chile and Argentina, that is also an hyper-arid zone and with very few records of Andean Cats (Marino <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011).<br/> <br/> According to this model and despite the differences in elevation over the current geographic range of the Andean Cat, there are common climatic conditions that favour for their presence, which are cold, dry and extreme diurnal variations in temperature (Marino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em>2011).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indiscriminately. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;<em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.",Terrestrial,"<p>Included on CITES Appendix I (as<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>Leopardus jacobitus</em>). The Andean Cat’s conservation status in the range countries was also re-assessed.

However, law enforcement is problematic, and hunted specimens are regularly observed in the field and for sale, although with less frequency than before, in special markets to be used in religious ceremonies.<br/> <br/> After developing the actions outlined in the Andean Cat Conservation Action Plan (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004) and the information generated in the last 10 years, the Andean Cat Alliance elaborated the Strategic Plan for Andean Cat Conservation (AGA 2011) with the following objectives and maintaining the three main lines of action: Research, Education and Conservation:<br/> <br/> a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To ensure long-term conservation of the Andean Cat and its natural environment, including the restoration or rehabilitation of the environments that have suffered degradation.<br/> <br/> b.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To integrate the conservation of the Andean Cat and its natural environment within local policies in the four countries where the species is present, working locally but with a global approach.<br/> <br/> c.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To strengthen activities of conservation and research in protected areas with Andean Cat populations, and to promote the creation or extension of existing protected areas to provide connectivity and/or protection of habitats and Andean cat populations.<br/> <br/> d.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To promote research on the conservation threats, ecological requirements of the species, its principal prey, and other sympatric carnivores.<br/> <br/> e.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To standardize the activities of working groups under common and more effective goals.<br/> <br/> f.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To train protected areas staff and local communities in activities in research, education and conservation, within and outside protected areas.<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is found in several protected areas across its range and some were prioritized for promoting effective conservation of the species as well as their habitats and others for the need to carry out surveys and promote effective conservation actions.<br/> <br/> Mining and oil/gas extraction are a priority economic activity in South American countries, even in protected areas, therefore lobbying with authorities and the industry sector, as well as promoting and/or supporting the implementation of mitigation plans to minimize impacts are fundamental actions to be addressed (Walker<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Similarly, community-based conservation is an essential approach that is being implemented by promoting or supporting sustainable economic initiatives, favouring better practices in livestock management or other activities oriented to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. Community education and support for law enforcement are also important activities to minimize or stop Andean Cat hunting and encourage positive attitudes towards Andean cats and high Andean biodiversity.<br/><br/><strong> National legislation</strong><br/> <br/> <u>Argentina</u><br/> The Andean Cat is protected by National Law 22421 of wildlife conservation and its Statutory<br/> Decree 666/97.

Comparing a breeding recent range estimate (42 “source sites” totalling 90,000&#160; km² : Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b) to a 2006 total range estimate (1.1 million km² : Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) suggests a range decline much greater than 50% over the last three generations (7 x 3 = 21 years). As per IUCN guidelines (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2007, IUCN 2013), we calculated generation length at seven years based on approximate age of maturity (four years) plus half the length of the reproductive lifespan (six years) (based on Smith and McDougal 1991 and unpublished information). This decline continues and at least two of the source populations listed in Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010b) have apparently been lost (one from Lao PDR and one from Thailand). In 2006, it was believed that breeding populations existed in 13 countries, but now known breeding Tiger populations occur only in eight (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Russia).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). A comparison of these population estimates of the 1990s (many with little scientific rigour) to similar current ones (many of better quality; see Table 1 in attached Supporting Material) suggests a decline of about 50% (taking the upper bound of 7,000 as the number of mature individuals in 1993, using a precautionary approach, declining to approximately 3,500 in 2014), but differences in methodologies and accuracy make such comparisons uncertain. This declining trend is likely to persist in the face of continuing threats such as direct poaching, prey depletion and habitat degradation which continue in all range states. Although several sites in India and Nepal have indeed reported recent recoveries, population reductions may not be reversible in other areas where Tiger habitat itself has been lost. Given the uncertainties about future declines, criterion A4bcd is no longer used.<br/><br/>The Tiger is also listed as Endangered under criterion C1 because the population of mature individuals may be fewer than 2,500 individuals. Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a estimated 2,154 tigers in 42 protected source sites where there is evidence of breeding (two populations are since known to have been lost, as described above), and the numbers in Table 1 (see Supporting material) could be overestimated. Generally Tiger status outside the source sites is poor and large breeding populations are unlikely to exist. To ensure tiger persistence, large population sizes (implying highest possible densities) and high survival rates of breeding adult females are critical. Although well-protected tiger populations may achieve recruitment rates that can sustain annual losses from mortality and emigration of 20% or more (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006), some theoretical models suggest declines to extinction when annual mortality of breeding females exceeds 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). For the purposes of Red List assessment, the estimated population in Source Sites is a good proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers. This population has declined by over 20% during the last two generations (14 years); the decline continues and may not be reversible in all sites.<br/><br/>Previously, Tigers were also listed under criterion C2a(i), but we have removed this criterion because the population in the Western Ghats in India has increased to &gt;250 adults (Karanth unpublished data). Other subpopulations in Terai, Central India, and Russia may also have &gt;250 adults (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>See attached Supporting Material for alternative depictions of range and population details.","Tigers are found mainly in the forests of tropical Asia, although they historically occurred more widely in drier and colder climes. One subspecies, the Amur Tiger <em>P. t. altaica</em>, persists in the Russian Far East. Photos of Tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the Tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Tigers need to kill 50-60 large prey animals per year (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, like many large carnivores, preferred prey are key to successful reproduction and are those species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges. Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1–3 females, a common felid pattern of social organization. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - e.g., female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at about 400 km² (Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range from a maximum of 17-19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey are abundant (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2011, Soutyrina <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat and tonics is a primary threat to Tigers, which has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat, and continues at unsustainable rates. That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.<br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The thirteen Tiger Range Countries came together in an unprecedented pledge to double the world’s Tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Asian lunar calendar, with a goal of achieving at least 6,000 Tigers. This figure was based on a baseline global population of 3,200, agreed upon at a preparatory workshop held in Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2009; 3,200 Tigers was the IUCN Red List population estimate at that time. Since then, Tiger Range Countries have adjusted their baseline national Tiger estimates, finalized in the Global Tiger Recovery Program adopted at the International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010 (GTRP 2010).<br/><br/>The global Tiger estimate published in the 2010 Red List assessment of 2,154 tigers was an updated version of the estimate of Tiger numbers in source sites (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a). This was not a complete estimate of global Tiger numbers (for example, most Amur Tigers in Russia are found in unprotected areas), but justified because Tiger status outside the source sites is generally poor and poorly known. IUCN Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2010) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.” While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also “stress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.” Tigers require large populations to persist, and the survival rate of breeding adult females is a key parameter, with models suggesting population declines when mortality of breeding females rises over 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). The IUCN Guidelines advise that “mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.” Thus, for the purposes of the Red List assessment in 2010, the estimated population in the Source Sites was used as a proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers.<br/><br/>Due to extensive surveys using improved methodologies since this analysis, our understanding of tiger distribution and numbers is much improved, e.g., extensive camera trapping in Bhutan has demonstrated significant populations. Further, Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010a) ignored some important Tiger areas, e.g., thousands of square kilometres in Kerinci and Leuser National Parks known to contain breeding Tiger populations.&#160; Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates. However, because of differences in methodology, this can by no means be interpreted as an increase over the 2010 estimate of 2,154. Rather, it is a more complete counting. While Tiger numbers have increased in some areas in India (e.g. Western Ghats, Central India, and Corbett Landscapes in India), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey in Lao PDR is no longer considered a potential source site).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated, less rigorously, at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although to some extent the new numbers represent improved knowledge, it is clear that there have been substantial population declines, with Tigers all but eliminated from much of their recent forest range, particularly in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for further information about national Tiger population estimates.",Decreasing,"The Tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Over the past 100 years Tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Tigers inhabit less than 6% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Walston <em>et al.</em> 2010b), with a 42% decline since 2006. Breeding populations of Tigers are currently found in eight range states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. There is evidence of breeding in China and Myanmar between 2009 and 2014, though these populations are likely dependent on immigration from neighbouring countries. Tigers may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate Tiger range was carried out (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006) and China. While this was generally considered representative of current distribution, Tiger presence was confirmed in just 47% the TCUs, and 89% were scored as undergoing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and their prey.<br/><br/>This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, and in delineating Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual records of Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). TCLs were defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five Tigers, and Tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (again, roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41% decline from the range described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63), attributed primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007). Habitat loss due to deforestation was also to blame, notable particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake <em>et al</em>. 2010). In India, landscapes with Tigers found to be much smaller and more fragmented than in the original assessment (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63 and Figure 4.12).<br/><br/>Records of Tigers were collected over a ten-year period (1995–2004), a period which may have been too liberal for places like Cambodia which underwent a sharp rise in poaching pressure in the 1990s (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Appendix 6). While 53% of the TCU survey respondents reported evidence of Tiger breeding in the time period 1995–2004, out of over 2,500 point records collected in 2005, just 8% had confirmed evidence of breeding Tigers (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 11-17). Large areas of habitat were defined as Tiger landscapes based on suitability, but given data paucity on Tiger presence there were often few records of breeding and actual Tiger occupancy to substantiate these (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Figures 2.3 and 4.8).<br/><br/>A review of land management within Tiger Conservation Landscapes described the TCLs as “potential habitat for Tigers” and found only 21% of their area to be legally protected.&#160; Management effectiveness was generally poor in the protected areas, with regulatory, budgetary and enforcement constraints, and hunting cited as the main threat. Significant portions of the TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, oil and gas, minerals, etc.) (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Tiger range was revisited again in 2009, by which time the extent of the Tiger’s range collapse had become evident. “Vast areas of Southeast Asia [were] recently found to be void of Tigers and depleted of prey by hunters” (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a: 5). The exercise used a different methodology to prioritize areas for Tiger conservation.&#160; Source Sites were defined as areas with confirmed current presence of Tigers and evidence of breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. An extensive review of scientific literature as well as correspondence with Tiger scientists and protected area managers resulted in the identification of just 42 source sites totalling approximately 90,000 km².&#160; Many Southeast Asian countries, previously considered to have large areas with Tigers, were found, on the basis of extensive survey effort over the past decade or more, to have no healthy breeding populations. Since this publication, Lao PDR has lost its only source site, but Bhutan, originally listed as a country not containing source sites, has documented breeding populations. [See Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary material].<br/><br/>The map for this effort (Figure 1 in supplementary material) differentiates areas where breeding has been detected in the past five years (2009-2014), where Tigers, but no breeding have been detected in the past five years, areas surveyed where no Tigers were detected and areas not surveyed.&#160; Data include camera trap photos, DNA, and observations of Tigers and Tiger sign detected during scientific surveys.&#160; Unsurveyed areas were excluded from Tiger range.&#160; Figure 2 (attached Supporting Material)&#160; documents a 42% range decline since 2006, reflecting both real decline and improved knowledge from new and better surveys.","In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of Tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the Tiger to extinction (Nowell 2000). Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell 2007). Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu 2007). Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of Tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell 2007). In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of Tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching over 6,000. They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce Tiger products, and several have already engaged in illegal production of Tiger bone wine. Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of Tiger bone has decreased since China banned Tiger bone in 1993. Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu 2007). In 2008 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted a Decision stating that “Tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives” (CITES 2008).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for Tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure. But many Tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock. Conflict-killed Tigers can also feed into the illegal trade. Many Tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger poaching is driven by less by poverty and more by wealth (TRAFFIC 2008), which is putting expensive illegal Tiger products within reach of a rapidly growing group of potential consumers. TRAFFIC has documented rising levels of recent illegal trade within the Tiger range countries, with seizures and confiscations in 2007–2009 averaging the equivalent of approximately 150 Tigers per year (Verheij <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Interdictions represent just a fraction of the true level of illegal trade, indicating that Tigers are gravely imperilled by black market demand.",Terrestrial,"At a “Tiger Summit” held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13 Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP 2010). The goal is to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by 2022 through actions to: <br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats; <br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives; <br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade; <br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities; <br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and <br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range. <br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by Heads of State including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh, and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.<br/><br/>The future of Tiger range depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat. Within these landscapes, the most urgent need is to first secure the source sites—protected areas with viable Tiger populations—where most of the global Tiger population is now clustered, and many of which are currently too threatened to deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b).<br/><br/>Countries that do not currently support known breeding populations (Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) but still have large landscapes with suitable habitat, Tigers might still be recovered if government commitment to Tigers, staff capacity for law enforcement and legal frameworks for Tiger protection can be established (Lynam 2010), though reintroduction may be needed in some places.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50661611,18146,Prionailurus bengalensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread and relatively common species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although the island subspecies <em>P. b. iriomotensis </em>is assessed separately in the Red List because the population is small and isolated.&#160; Across its range, threats vary enormously by region, in the Western Ghats in India, for example, it is threatened by urbanisation (Seto <em>et al.</em> 2012), while in Viet Nam (Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2014ab) direct and indirect hunting are potentially causing large population declines. Across the majority of its range, however, this species appears to be stable and to readily use degraded forest (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2013) and even heavily modified habitats such as oil palm (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Yue <em>et al.</em> in press) and sugar cane plantations (Lorica and Heaney 2013). Consequently the Leopard Cat does not currently meet the criteria for any of the threatened categories. It is listed as Least Concern.","Leopard Cats can range up to 3,240 m asl (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010) and occur in a wide variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to temperate broadleaf and, marginally, coniferous forest, as well as shrub forest and successional grasslands. The northern boundary of its range is limited by snow cover, as the Leopard Cat does not occur in deep snow (but see Kerley and Bosienko 2013). It is not found in the cold steppe grasslands, and generally does not occur in arid, treeless areas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Leopard Cats occur commonly in dense secondary growth, including logged forest (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and have been found in Acacia (Giman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), oil palm (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Yue <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and sugarcane (Lorica and Heaney 2013) plantations. A camera trap study in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo found that both number of individuals and overall detections of Leopard Cats were higher in a small oil palm plantation with shorter distances to the nearest forest compared to a large plantation, suggesting that although Leopard Cats do use oil palm areas, forest habitat remains important (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It is still unknown how dependent Leopard Cats in oil palm plantations are on surrounding forest, or the maximum distances they will move into plantations, or even if plantations support stable populations. Leopard Cats can also live close to rural settlements. They are excellent swimmers, and have successfully colonized offshore islands throughout their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>From 20 radio-collared Leopard Cats in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) report mean home ranges of 12.7 km<sup>2</sup>, larger than that reported for other radio-collared Leopard Cats in Thailand (4.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) or on Borneo (roughly 3.0&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Rajaratnam 2007, Hearn and Ross, unpublished data) or Iriomote Island (Schmidt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) found no significant difference between the range sizes of males and females. They also found that habitat use was in proportion to occurrence. Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) report that Leopard Cats used oil palm plantations for hunting but forest fragments were important for resting and breeding. This was also seen in Sumatra, where Leopard Cats have been frequently recorded in remnant forest fragments in and amongst coffee plantations (McCarthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Murids have been shown to dominate the diet (Rabinowitz 1990, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Shehzad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Other small mammals, eels and fish have also been reported, as well as occasional scavenging of carrion (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Leopard Cat is predominantly nocturnal (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Lynam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), with crepuscular peaks in some areas (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) but some diurnal activity has been recorded (e.g. Saxena and Rajanshi 2014, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data).","In China, commercial exploitation has been heavy: hundreds of thousands of Leopard Cat skins per year were exported in the 1980s. Although commercial trade is now much reduced (Yu 2010) this species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution. In villages around Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, chicken depredation was frequently attributed to Leopard Cats, and commonly resulted in retribution killing of the species (McCarthy 2013). Island populations are small and seriously threatened in the Philippines and Japan. Leopard Cats can hybridize with domestic cats, as is shown by the popular domestic breed, the Bengal Cat although most of these exotic cats are now bred from Bengal Cat stock rather than wild crosses (TICA, The International Cat Association 2012). Hybridization in the wild has been reported, but is not considered a significant threat. Although this species is less dependent on forest cover than others, habitat loss and fragmentation is still a threat across most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) report population densities of 9.6, 12.4 and 16.5 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, from three selectively logged forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. They also found that population density increased with forest disturbance. A similar relationship with forest disturbance was found in the Western Ghats, India, but densities here were generally lower at 10.45 and 4.48 individuals/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;from Badhra and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserves, respectively (Srivathsa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Across most of its range the Leopard Cat is recorded more frequently than sympatric cats (e.g. Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Yasuda <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Gumal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014), especially in disturbed areas such as logging concessions (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), however, in some surveys leopard cats are recorded less frequently than other species (e.g. Pusparini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Loken <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), particularly in areas of primary forest (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Leopard Cats have also been detected in oil palm plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Rajaratnam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Yue <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press), however, fewer individual Leopard Cats were detected, and the detection rate was lower, in a survey of a large oil palm plantation, located at a greater distance from natural or semi-natural vegetation, compared to a smaller plantation, located close to natural vegetation, (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), suggesting that proximity to surrounding forest remains an important factor.<br/><br/>With a wide distribution and tolerance to human modified landscapes the Leopard Cat’s population is abundant. However, it is not invulnerable to habitat loss and degradation and this, coupled with hunting, is likely causing population declines in some regions (e.g. Seto <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Wilcox <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014a, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). In the late 1980s on average 200,000 Leopard Cat skins were exported from China (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although the actual harvest was likely much higher, possibly up to 400,000 (Yu 2010). Although the Leopard Cat is more tolerant to habitat disturbance than sympatric felids it likely experiences higher mortality rates in these areas (e.g. Rajaratnam 2000). Haines <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2004) report survival rates of 92% in a protected area compared with only 53-82% in areas with higher human activity. <br/><br/>Island populations are particularly at risk of extinction, with the Iriomote Cat <em>P.b. iriomotensis</em> listed as Critically Endangered, and the Visayan Leopard Cat <em>P.b. rabori</em> of the Philippine islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu and possibly Masbate listed as Vulnerable. The small population (approximately 100) on Japan's 710 km<sup>2</sup> Tsushima Island, considered the same subspecies as that which occurs in northeast mainland Asia, has decreased over the last 30-40 years (Izawa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). The population of the Western Ghats, India is geographically isolated due to a climate barrier and should be managed as a discrete conservation unit (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).",Stable,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread species. It is found through parts of India, west into Pakistan and Afghanistan (Habibi 2003), through the Himalayan foothills, throughout most of China, and north to the Korean peninsula and into the Russian Far East (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its range extends south throughout Southeast Asia, and includes the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Taiwan. The Leopard Cat is found on numerous small offshore islands of mainland Asia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It is the only wild felid in Japan, where it occurs on the small islands of Tsushima and Iriomote, and the Philippines, where it occurs on the islands of Palawan, Panay, Negros and Cebu, there are unconfirmed reports from Masbate but it is presumed to be extinct on Guimaras.<br/><br/>There are many recent records from protected and non-protected areas throughout its range examples include Borneo: Danum Valley Conservation Area and surrounding production forest, Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Crocker Range National Park, Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kabili-Sepilok and Gomantong Forest Reserves, and Tawau Hills National Park (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), Maliau Basin Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2011), Deramakot Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2009), Sabangau National Park (Cheyne and Macdonald 2011), Wehea Forest (Loken <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data), Upper Baram region of Sarawak (Mathai <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010), Sumatra: Gunung Leuser National Park (Pusparini <em><em><em><em>et al.&#160;</em></em></em></em>2014), Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), Singapore: Pulau Tekong (Chua 2013), Peninsular Malaysia: Endau Rompin National Park (Gumal <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Cambodia: Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Myanmar: Taninthary Nature Reserve and Hlawga Park (Than <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Thailand: Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Simcharoen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014) Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Lao PDR: Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014a), Nepal: Chitwan National Park (Lamichhane <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Makalu-Barun National Park (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010), India: Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary (Punjabi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014), Rajaji National Park (Saxena and Rajvanshi 2014), Bhutan: Royal Manas National Park (Tempa <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), China: Wanglang National Nature Reserve (Yu 2010), Russia: Zov Tigra National Park (Kerley and Borisenko 2013).<br/><br/>The range map of the current assessment is based on known localities, coupled with habitat (Hansen 2013), molecular and climatic data (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).","Leopard Cat skins are commercially traded internationally for the fur trade, primarily coats. Skins are also used as decorations in some parts of its range. Leopard Cats are occasionally kept as pets, sometimes taken from the wild and sometimes from captive breeding and they have been interbred with domestic cats, particularly in the West, to make the popular Bengal breed. Their bones are used in some traditional Asian medicines (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Leopard Cat populations in Bangladesh, India and Thailand are listed on CITES Appendix I, and all other populations are listed on Appendix II.",Terrestrial,"The Leopard Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II, and populations in Bangladesh, India and Thailand are included on Appendix I (as <em>Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis</em>).

50662095,18148,Prionailurus planiceps,Endangered,C1,2015,2014-05-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted and patchy distribution around wetlands in lowland forest on the islands of Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula. It was formerly also distributed in southern Thailand but the last confirmed observation was almost 20 years ago (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010). Current status distribution is limited to presence data, and there are few records in comparison with sympatric small felids. The extent to which this reflects patterns of survey design and effort rather than patterns of distribution is unclear. Wetland destruction and degradation and the very high deforestation rate in southeast Asia is the primary threat faced by the species (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010). Since 2010 there have been few new photo captures of this species with camera traps. The reason for this can be due to the special wetland-based ecology of the species, but as they have been previously photographed on main roads, as well as in the forest and along trails, it is believed unlikely to be the sole reason. It was photographed only a few times in the Kinabatangan area of Sabah, of Borneo (an area thought to have the best habitat for the species), despite hundreds of camera traps (A. Hearn pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Over 45% of protected wetlands and 94% of globally significant wetlands in Southeast Asia are considered threatened (Dugan 1993) and although the situation today is unknown, it is unlikely to be radically better and may be much worse. Causes include human settlement, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid. While there have been observations of the Flat-headed Cat in secondary forests (Bezuijen 2000, Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009), Wilting <em>et al</em>. (2010) could not find any support that the Flat-headed Cat can also live in oil palm plantations. According to their distribution model, over 70% of its predicted historical suitable habitat has been transformed to unsuitable habitats (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2000-2010 the Flat-headed Cat lost over 20% of potentially suitable habitat (10% in Peninsular Malaysia, 17% in Borneo and 41% in Sumatra; extracted from Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on these rates of habitat loss and together with other threats such as pollution of wetlands and hunting it is very likely that the Flat-headed Cat population declined by at least 20% in the last 12 years (two generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and will also continue to decline over the next 12 years by more than 20%.<br/><br/>It is difficult to estimate population size given its patchy distribution and lack of any density estimates. However the low number of camera-trapping records and direct sightings compared to other Southeast Asian cat species seem to support the notion that the Flat-headed Cat is very rare and/or very specialized in its habitat requirements. An area of occupancy map predicted a species distribution area of about 61,000 km² for Borneo (Wilting <em>et al</em>. unpublished data of the Borneo Carnivore Symposium). For Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra we inferred that additional 10,000 km² and 8,100 km², respectively, could be occupied. If we take a density of four individuals per 100 km² within this 80,000 km², and assuming that not all individuals of a population are mature individuals we would infer a population size which is plausibly fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. For the Flat-headed Cat with its very patchy distribution and its close associations to water resources the average density of four individuals per 100 km² is rather conservative, although in some well suitable areas the density might also be much higher than this. Using a higher average density (&gt;5 mature individulas per 100 km²) would lead to population estimates which would qualify the species as Vulnerable (C1). The IUCN Red List Guidelines (vers. 11, Feb 2014) caution that multiplying density times area extent often leads to “gross overestimation” of the number of mature individuals. Although density estimations of Flat-headed Cats would be needed to verify the inferred numbers, the great threat to Southeast Asian wetlands further supports the classification as Endangered under the precautionary principle.<a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Very little is known about this species, and the available information suggest that, like its close relative the fishing cat, the Flat-headed Cat is strongly associated with wetlands and preys primarily on fish. Stomach contents of two dead animals contained mostly fish, and also shrimp shells. They may also take birds and small rodents, and have been reported to prey on domestic poultry (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/> <br/> Most records for the Flat-headed Cat are from swampy areas, lakes and streams, and riverine forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007). They also occur in peat-swamp forest (Bezuijen 2000), and have been observed in secondary forest (Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). All published observations of live animals have taken place at night or early morning, near water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007). Over 80% of the records gathered by Wilting <em>et al.</em> (2010) were from elevations below 100 m asl, and over 70 % were recorded within a distance of three km to larger water sources. <br/> <br/> The Flat-headed Cat takes its name from its unusually long, sloping snout and flattened skull roof, with small ears set well down the sides of its head. It has large, close-set eyes, and relatively longer and sharper teeth than its close relatives. Its claws do not fully retract into their shortened sheaths, and its toes are more completely webbed than the Fishing Cat's, with long narrow foot pads. Muul and Lim (1970), commenting on the cat's feet and other features, termed it the ecological counterpart of a semi-aquatic mustelid.","<p></p><p>Wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation is the primary threat faced by the species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in Tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and is likely to be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat (Wilting <em>et al. </em>2010). Trapping, snaring and poisoning are also threats: E. Bennett (in Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) reported that skins were frequently seen in longhouses in the interior of Sarawak, and the Flat-headed Cat has been captured in traps set out to protect domestic fowl (Nowell and Jackson 1996).</p>","<p></p><p>The Flat-headed Cat is closely associated with wetlands and lowland forests, habitats which are increasingly being occupied and modified by people (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). It has never been studied, there are few records of the species, and it is generally considered rare, with a highly localized distribution around bodies of water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Anonymous 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007, Barita and Boeadi pers. comm. 2006, Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). Although fishermen along the Merang River in south Sumatra (which has relatively intact peat forests) described it as common (Bezuijen 2000), they tend to use a single generic term for both Flat-headed Cat and Leopard Cat <em>Prionailurus bengalensis</em>, a more abundant species (Bezuijen 2003). Most of the recent records come from Sabah in northeastern Borneo, where it can be frequently be observed along the Kinabatangan River (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010), and where it has been several times recorded by camera-traps in Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). Recently camera-trapping records come from a mixed-used plantation area, which includes conservation reserves within the oil palm estates in East Kalimantan (Wahyudi and Struebing 2013) and from Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia (Wadey <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted distribution, found only on Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula (Malaysia and extreme southern Thailand).

50664030,22732,Panthera uncia,Vulnerable,C1,2017,2016-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Snow Leopard is assessed as Vulnerable because the global population is estimated to number more than 2,500 but fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, and there is an estimated and projected decline of at least 10% over 22.62 years (3 generations). There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book <em>Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson<em> et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the <em>Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex <em></em>(<em>Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (<em>Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (<em>Capra</em> <em>falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (<em>Marmota </em>spp.), pika (<em>Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (<em>Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (<em>Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of <em>ca</em> 25 years (Lovari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali <em>Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi <em>et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
79818502,4288,Rucervus schomburgki,Extinct,,2015,2014-11-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The wild Thai population of Schomburgk’s Deer died out around 1932, with the last captive individual being killed in 1938. None of the indications that the species inhabited other countries can be shown to have any compelling basis and some are clearly in error. Thus the species is considered a single-country endemic, to Thailand, where it is certainly Extinct.","The species inhabited seasonally inundated swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs; it apparently avoided forest (Giles 1937), although there seems to be no information on where animals went at the height of the wet season, when much of the dry-season range was under water.","Commercial production of rice for export began in the late nineteenth century in Thailand’s central plains, leading to the loss of nearly all the grassland and swamp areas that this deer depended on, and greatly fragmented what remained. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19th–20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.","Schomburgk’s Deer was apparently “not uncommon” in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and herds still occurred around 1900–1910 (Harper 1945), but the species underwent a very rapid decline: Harper (1945) stated that it was never seen in the wild state by a European (although this may be better taken as a lack of such reports, because Europeans working, for example, on the Paknampo railway in the early days would almost surely have seen and hunted these deer; G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.",,"<em>Rucervus schomburgki</em> was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.<br/><br/>Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996). Consequently, while remains of the species have been seen in Lao PDR in recent times, they cannot be taken as evidence that the species survives today, or ever occurred in Lao PDR.","Relics of this extinct species (usually antlers) are still traded to a limited extent. During its last few decades of existence Schomburgk's Deer was hunted heavily, presumably for meat, and certainly for antlers which went into the Chinese medicine trade (e.g. Williams 1941, Harper 1945).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"As an extinct species there are no appropriate conservation measures. The indication that a remnant population might still survive (Schroering 1995 and <em>in litt</em>. as reported in Grubb 2005, MacPhee and Flemming 1999) was followed up by investigation, independently by several people, of Phongsali province, Lao PDR, by field survey and interview. This failed to find any further evidence of the species there or to elicit a consistent story of the origin of the antlers (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, per J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Given regional trends in Schomburgk’s Deer’s sole known habitat, non-forest floodplains (its massive conversion to agriculture over the last 150 years) it is unlikely that the species could survive. However, any future indication of its existence should be followed up carefully. If by chance the species does survive, legislation giving it the highest levels of protection (in whatever country it was found), and an assessment of specific conservation needs would be imperative.",Indomalayan,last captive 1938; last wild animal known in 1932,false,false,Global
85628124,41790,Rusa unicolor,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Sambar is listed as Vulnerable through sustained declines across its range. These vary in severity between regions, and in some areas considerably exceed the threshold for Vulnerable. In the last three generations (taken to be 24–30 years), declines in mainland South-east Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia), Bangladesh, and possibly Borneo and Sumatra have exceeded 50%, probably by a substantial margin. Despite this Sambar remains common in some localized logged, unprotected areas on Borneo, such as the Hose Mountains of Sarawak (where a national park is proposed but not yet enforced), but only where human access is difficult. The overall decline rate in India has been less, given the presence of large populations in a fair number of well-secured protected areas which have probably remained stable, but a decline rate averaging 30% is reasonable in India outside these areas (i.e. in the less effective protected areas and outside the protected areas network), and in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The situation in China is unclear as in some areas, for example Hainan, population recovery may be occurring, whilst major declines in other regions may have taken place prior to the 24–30 year assessment window; the population on Taiwan appears to be relatively stable. Although declines seem to be reversing very locally in a few sites, these numbers are a very small proportion of the whole population. There is no indication that declines will, at the species level, slow until populations are extinguished outside well-secured protected areas, which currently comprise only a small proportion of protected areas holding the species. Current trends of wild meat and antler marketing in South-east Asia and China suggest declines have probably sped up in some areas especially Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Since the 2008 assessment trends in wildlife exploitation and natural habitat conversion in mainland Southeast Asia, have if anything increased, thus although the relative size of the Southeast Asian population subcomponent has probably decreased compared with that in South Asia, the rate of decline has probably increased. The global population trend is still considered to be a decline somewhere between 30 and 50 % over three generations, for the past, present and future.&#160;The fact that Sambar is at least locally common in a number of high profile protected areas, such as Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and Cat Tien National Park, Viet Nam, and is commonly kept captive and proliferates in menageries in the region, was probably a significant factor in the failure to recognize the plight of the species prior to the 2008 reassessment. These same factors no doubt still to some degree cloud the issue.","No large Indian ungulate has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions than has Sambar (Schaller 1967). Within India, Sambar occurs in the thorn and arid forests of Gujarat and Rajasthan, in the moist and dry deciduous forests throughout peninsular India, in the pine and oak forests at the Himalayan foothills, and in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of northeastern India and the Western Ghats (Sankar and Acharya 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Outside India it extends into temperate-latitude and alpine-zone woodlands of Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). This habitat flexibility is permitted by its broad diet: Sambar has been documented to eat 130–180 species of plants in India alone (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh and Sankar 1991, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), with food requirements less specialised than those of other deer (Schaller 1967). Sambar grazes or browses depending upon the forage available at that time (Schaller 1967, Richardson 1972, Martin 1977, Bentley 1978, Dinerstein 1979, Kelton and Skipworth 1987, Ngampongsai 1987, Sankar 1994, Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Across the very wide altitudinal range occupied in Taiwan, the diet varies reflecting major changes in plant communities (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). Sambar was found to live in much higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests of Nagarahole National Park (Karanth and Sunquist 1992) and there are no doubt also patterns of habitat selection across the rest of its range. Although the highest densities of Sambar so far recorded were in the semi-arid forests of Ranthambore (Kumar 2000), across most of its Indian range Sambar seems to thrive best in well-watered, moist deciduous hilly terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The Sambar occurs up to at least 3,825 m on Siouguluan Mountain, the highest peak of the Central Mountains in Taiwan; elsewhere on the island it ranges down to 150 m asl, mostly living at 2,000–3,500 m (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). It occurs up to 3,000 m on Gunung Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Myanmar, recent camera-trap photographs spanned the range of 0–2,150 m asl (Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is largely restricted to hilly terrain in the Terai Arc Landscape (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), although how much this reflects real habitat selection and how much it is an artificial pattern produced by human effects (habitat conversion and hunting) is unclear. More widely in India, there does seem to be a marked preference for undulating terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar usage was greater of the higher than the lower altitude area. However, it makes wide use of plains areas elsewhere, where these have not been destroyed, e.g. the Hukaung Valley in Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008).In Borneo, while Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered Sambar “most common in secondary forests of gently-sloping terrain” they also knew of occurrence in “tall dipterocarp forests on steep terrain and in swamp forests”. In Thung Yai, Thailand, Sambar signs were twice as abundant in lowland forest as in montane forest, although this difference was not statistically significant (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Across seven sites in Thailand, places where sambar was detected had shallower slopes, more open habitat, were closer to streams, closer to roads and villages, and had lower rainfall (Lynam <em>et al. </em>2012).In Southeast Asian regions of dense evergreen closed-canopy forest, Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978, Heydon 1994, Stuebing 1995, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Sabah, Sambar was camera-trapped in both mature and young forest stands (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). All the remaining Lao populations are centred around areas with extensive open, or at least broken, habitat amid forest (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), and the general paucity of records from the interiors of large blocks of closed-canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which generally support the least depleted large mammal populations, probably reflects natural patterns of habitat occupation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Similarly, in extensive tracts of deciduous dipterocarp forest the species occurs primarily around patches of denser habitats, and this seems to be a natural rather than hunting-led pattern (Timmins and Ou 2001). In this sense, in Indochina Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em> is much more tolerant and versatile than is Sambar. In southern and central India where much of the forest is deciduous, Sambar is a true forest ungulate and conspicuously avoids disturbed and open forests, and is highly sensitive to any sort of forest resource extractive activities (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar was primarily in areas of high tree and herb density with low shrub density. O'Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) found no statistically significant difference in Sambar abundance between areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and those deep in the interior of the park. Caution is needed in inferring that there is truly no association of Sumatran Sambar with forest edges (which would be astonishing by comparison with its habitat use elsewhere) because the study does not specify whether this ‘non-significant’ result might simply reflect methodological factors rather than a genuine lack of biological effect (see, e.g., Johnson 1999). Despite the population rises that occur in post-logging forest, there is no evidence that Sambar can survive landscape-level conversion to exotic plantations or other non-forest land-uses, although many live in coconut plantations (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and it is relatively common in immature <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations within the matrix of plantation and natural forest of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;Camera trapping in oil palm plantations adjacent to Danum Valley in Sabah suggest that the species does not utilize plantations (Yue and J. Brodie unpublished data).A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Sambar only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007). In forest protected areas of Thailand such as Khao Yai National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sambar populations are often concentrated around anthropogenic grass and scrub (e.g. sites of former villages) rather than in the forest itself (Trisurat <em>et al</em>. 1996; Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and this also seems to be true on remote parts of the Bolaven Plateau of south Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Annamite mountains of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Sambar seems often to be associated with degraded valley bottom areas, largely the result of long human influence: although the effects of a permanent water source and differences in terrain in determining distribution are difficult to disentangle (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar regularly visits salt licks (e.g. Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007), perhaps especially when growing new antlers. This predictability exposes it to high levels of hunting, where this is not effectively controlled. It seems that within an area, not all sort of licks are visited. At the Seima Biodivesity Conservation Area, Cambodia, Sambar photographs were initially very few at mineral lick camera-traps. But in 2007, cameras placed on trails and at some permanent water sources (especially in semi-evergreen forest) recorded Sambar much more often. Checking tracks at more than 40 licks indicated that some were used by Sambar and Red Muntjac, but not Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> or Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, while the big ones with many cattle and elephant prints had few Sambar prints (E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar was considered to be mostly nocturnal by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004), to show ‘no pattern’ (meaning unclear; perhaps intended to imply no significant variation through the 24-hour cycle, although this is itself a pattern) by O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003), and to be cathemeral by van Schaik and Griffiths (1996). In fact, its activity pattern may vary across sites, but in general it is mostly crepuscular, with significant nocturnal activity as well (Schaller 1967; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is essentially non-social, stable groups being at most family associations (Schaller 1967; Karanth and Sunquist 1992). However, it is often in groups, presumably temporary, of 12–30 in dry deciduous and semi-arid forests of India (e.g. Bandipur, Pench, Melghat and Ranthambore) (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and the same is true around the secondary grasslands within Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). During peak summer, such associations of up to 80–100 near large waterbodies are not uncommon in Pench in central India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A detailed review of information on grouping in Sambar is in Sankar and Acharya (2004). Results from many areas show a strong bias in sex ratio to females, perhaps reflecting selective predation; alternatively, stags may be more vulnerable to stress (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Breeding is rather seasonal in most areas where studied, for example Schaller (1967) reported that in Kanha the rut spreads over a period of at least seven months with a peak in November–December. Stags during the rut sometimes can cover large distances, up to 10–20 km in one night. Further information for India is reviewed in Sankar and Acharya (2004). The bucks of Formosan Sambar have a seasonal antler cycle, and the mating season is from June to January with a peak in September–October. Males wallow and mark with scent glands in this season. Fawns are born (usually singly) from March to August, with a peak in May and June (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Predation appears to be the major cause of Sambar mortality. In Bandipur, Sambar is one of the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (31%), Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> (8%) and Dhole <em>C. alpinus</em> (13%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur Sambar remains were found in about 22.3% of Tiger faeces, 6.1% of Leopard faeces and 7.3% of Dhole faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, proportion of Sambar in Tiger’s diet was about 25–29%, derived from faeces and kill data respectively (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Sambar together with Gaur contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). Sambar occurred in 50% of Tiger scats in Pench-Maharashtra (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Sambar together with Gaur are selectively predated by Tiger.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region and in much of the rest of Sambar’s range. Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow <em>Capricornis crispus</em> and Reeves’s Muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).<br/><br/>There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats <em>Panthera</em>) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs <em>Munitacus</em> spp.<br/><br/>Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (<span lang=""EN-US"">A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002,&#160;J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km<sup>2</sup> per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing,&#160;as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press).&#160;Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.<br/><br/>On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and muntjacs <em>Muntiacus</em>) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001).&#160;Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).<br/><br/><p> </p>  <p>In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of <em>Acacia mangium</em> although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments.&#160;The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p>Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). &#160;If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound.</p><p><br/></p> Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brodie <em>et al. </em>in press b, c). Degradation <em>per se</em> is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2014; Lynam<em> et al.</em> 2012, Brodie<em> et al.</em> in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species. &#160;In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.<br/> <br/> Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa <em>Rusa timorensis</em> has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital <em>Axis axis</em> (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.</span>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Almost everywhere outside Taiwan and <span lang=""EN-GB"">well-managed protected areas<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">in India, the Sambar is in rapid decline, which has lead to very low numbers and many local-level extinctions over a wide area. The occasional healthy populations reflecting special circumstances. Few surveys specifically target Sambar, but a reasonable picture of its current status is emerging through surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris </em>and through general wildlife surveys. Tiger-oriented camera-trapping predictably yields photographs of Sambar when it is present, and most Tiger surveys afford priority to elucidating Sambar status as a key prey, and therefore population determinant, of Tiger. Understanding Sambar status through surveys of Tigers or, sometimes, of Leopard <em>P. pardus </em>(e.g. Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2007) needs care, because such surveys have generally selected the best remaining areas for very large mammals within the country or region in question, so as to maximize chances of picking up Tigers. They therefore cannot be seen as indicative of Sambar status in the wider landscape. Most importantly, in the several cases (identified below) where such surveys have found few Sambar, these indicate cause for alarm, because there is little reason to believe that there ought to be larger populations in many other areas in the country or region in question, even though large parts of it may remain unsurveyed. Occasional herds can survive in unexpected places through atypical site-specific circumstances in some countries (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Populations outside the native range are not treated here, as they are irrelevant to assigning the Red List Category and Criteria.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Sri Lanka, numbers have probably declined substantially through poaching which increased during the civil war. Poaching occurred widely across the country, including within protected areas, particularly where there are concentrations of resettled refugees (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/> <br/> In India, although the Sambar occurs widely and in many habitat types, and large populations occur in well-secured protected areas, nowhere is it now regionally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004); although see below. It has been recorded in 208 protected areas (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India, cited in Sankar and Acharya 2004); its distribution outside protected areas is now generally highly scattered. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Sambar status is best in the three southern Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Most protected areas (tiger reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries) in these states appear to have stable or even increasing Sambar local populations and they are easily one of the most common ungulates encountered in protected areas (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Protected areas in Karnataka in particular have high densities of Sambar&#160; (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Hunting and poaching has been more problematic in areas of Kerala, but it also has some very well protected areas and there is also constant in-migration from protected areas outside of Kerala, this is especially so in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve area (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. The situation outside&#160;protected areas&#160;in the three southern states is however often very different and “mostly in the red”, but there are a few exceptions, like the Valparai Plateau in Tamil Nadu where Sambar is very common, and can be found on private lands (Sridhar <em>et al. </em>2008, N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. In the southern Western Ghats in particular and some parts to the north of this, there has been no noticeable decline in Sambar distribution in the last twenty years (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). However there are indications, based on interview data that abundance has been declining in the Western Ghats (Pillay<em> et al.</em> 2011). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">In other central and east Indian states Sambar is “very rare”, “extremely patchy and in severe decline” “owing to severe hunting pressures, insurgency, rapidly spreading mines (both bauxite and iron-ore)” (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <br/></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The reported ecological densities of Sambar in India mostly fall within 1–10 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;within the protected area network, and depending on the varying levels of protection efficacy: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 0.89 +/- 0.23 (SE) per km<sup>2</sup> (Jathanna <em>et al.</em> 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 9.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 1.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 5.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 5.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Melghat dry deciduous forest, 2.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.9 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 10.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, two animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan et al. 1996). Similar surveys at Kaziranga found too few Sambar to estimate populations there (Karanth and Nichols 2000), this presumably representing habitat characters rather than defective protection, given the buoyant populations of other deer at that site (Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and forest-resource extraction (Jathanna <em>et al. </em>2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data as of 2008).<span lang=""EN-GB""> Local population trends in well protected reserves appear to be stable and even increasing in areas recently freed from anthropogenic pressures (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. But in poorly protected reserved forests subject to hunting and heavy cattle grazing, Sambar density seems to be extremely low; certainly too low to permit actual estimation of density (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">Outside protected areas, Sambar is present mostly in very low numbers, although larger numbers can still be found where its habitat is almost inaccessible to people (Anonymous 2008).<br/> <br/> Nepal supports an important population in Bardia National Park (Dinerstein 1979). This remains healthy and there are also good populations in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Across the country Sambar has declined so rapidly and so widely that it is now very rare outside protected areas, mostly recorded as isolated reports from forests adjoining these protected areas, and from south-east Nepal. Sambar has been victim of poachers, probably because of its large size (thus, more meat per animal and, for males, a more impressive trophy), perhaps compounded by nocturnal and relatively docile nature; recent declines are of the magnitude to meet IUCN criteria for Vulnerable on a national assessment (all information: Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). It is unclear whether the demand for antler in velvet in eastern Asia is stimulating poaching in Nepal.<br/> <br/> No information concerning current status was traced from Bhutan but (simply on an area basis) numbers are unlikely to be large enough to influence the overall global population trend.<br/> <br/> In Bangladesh, the Sambar was common in the north-east, south-east and hill-tract forests in the 1960s (Khan 1985) but now is restricted to the forest fragments of the southeast, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar occurrence in protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and eco parks) is now doubtful and all recent records and reports have come from outside protected areas from areas that were largely inaccessible to the majority of people prior to 1997 due to insurgency (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar was detected by camera-trapping at 22 of 38 surveyed grid cells (each &gt;50% forest cover&#160; and 10,000 ha) in the CHT during 2010-2011, but it was assumed that outside the survey area, Sambar was either absent or occurred in very low numbers (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Within the best two grid cells (rated in terms of forest cover, inaccessibility and presence of Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>) detection rate of Sambar was 2.07 independent photos/100 camera trap nights. Following the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladesh Government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (the political organization of CHT indigenous people) both the rate of habitat loss and hunting pressure have been accelerating in the period after 1997 (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). There is no sign of significant change in either factor in near future and if current habitat loss and hunting rates continue indefinitely extirpation of sambar is likely within the next 30 years (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""> In China there were major declines in Sambar over much of the twentieth century, and populations probably decreased by more than 50% in the 30 years from 1978 to 2008; records from Guangxi suggest that, there at least, the 1970s–1980s was the era of fastest decline (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008; B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). In some provinces populations seem now to have stabilized, and in some areas, particularly in Hainan (where several apparently stabilised populations are present, but all are small, reflecting habitat patch size: the largest may be of only a few hundred animals) and north Guangdong province (perhaps also the east of that province, where there is a nature reserve specifically for the species), populations may even have been increasing once again in the last few years. This is not so for Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Further north, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei, a multi-method Tiger survey in 2001 found that Sambar is very rare overall and scattered in present-day distribution (Tilson <em>et al.</em> 2004). For elsewhere in China, Smith and Xie Yan (2008) mapped wide presence in Sichuan, plus isolated populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, and Fujian. The original sources are not clear, and R. Harris (pers. comm.) doubts that Sambar has lived anywhere in Qinghai in recent times. <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, numbers and geographic distribution reduced rapidly through hunting before 1987, then expanded somewhat since the mid 1990s reflecting reductions in hunting. The average population density in the Yu-Li Wildlife Refuge was 10.6 animals per km² in 2005. In some areas at high altitude, densities exceed 40 animals per km², and the animals have a large impact on the coniferous saplings in this area. But at low to mid altitude, hunting pressure remains high enough to restrain their distribution and density. Based on the known geographical distribution, there are five populations: A-Yu Mountain, Nanhu, Shei-Pa, Jade Mountains–Central Mountains, and Tawu. The A-Yu population was re-introduced (about 70 animals) by local deer farmers in 1988–1991, when the velvet price was very low through the impact of deer TB in 1985. This population has not expanded reflecting continuous poaching; it may be genetically polluted. The other four populations are all natural, assumed to be isolated by cross-island roads, and may have very low gene flows with each other. Sambar is largely restricted to protected areas, only occurring outside them in a few nearby areas. The population sizes and distributions in these areas are smaller than in the protected areas. The poaching pressure is an important limitation to Sambar in these unprotected areas (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Myanmar, Sambar was detected at 12 of 15 camera-trapped Tiger sites during 1999–2002, indicating that it was still widespread (Lynam 2003). Sambar meat and antlers were commonly found in local markets in the Hukaung Valley in 2002 (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014) indicating heavy hunting pressure, possibly partially explaining extremely low densities of tigers in the area at that time (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; The Myanmar Forest Department and Wildlife Conservation Society have since jointly (as of May 2008) camera-trapped 21 survey areas (including the earlier 15) and found Sambar in 13 (S. Htun pers. comm. 2008). This lower ratio of proven presence indicates how the areas selected for Tiger survey were above average for prey and may indicate increasing local-level extinctions. For example, in a multi-method study of one area not expected to hold Tiger, hunted animals showed that Sambar still occurred in Naungmung and Machanbaw (south of Hkakaborazi National Park, Kachin state), but it was so scarce that it was not detected by substantial amounts of either camera trapping or sign surveys (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005). Even within these best areas, large declines are suspected and overall national population losses of about 50% over the last 25–30 years and in the following such period are likely (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006; Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Thailand, several protected areas maintain big Sambar populations; these are mostly large with very few or no people living within them. Over much of the country Sambar is extinct or very nearly so, including in many protected areas, particularly in the north where most parks are small and heavily poached (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is rare in most areas of Thung Yai Naresuan, where commercial hunting has targeted large ungulates (Steinmetz <em>et al. </em>2008). Sambar was recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations during a Leopard survey in Kaeng Krachan National Park, and clearly remains widespread there. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert et al. 2007). Sambar is also locally abundant in Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam et al. 2006), and the remote core zone of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). In Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary current Sambar density is about 2–3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and it seems to be increasing (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Lao PDR, Sambar was described as very common throughout the wooded parts by Delacour (1940). Some decades later, the species was reported during 86% of 1988–1993 village interviews (n = 328) and was then still widespread throughout, except in the most heavily settled areas (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999: Annex 5). However, sightings on surveys during 1992–1998 were very rare, and while calls heard by night and signs indicate a wide distribution, numbers are heavily depressed (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001). Only in Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA did Sambar seem at least locally abundant (Davidson 1998), and reasonable populations were confirmed still to persist in 2003–2004 (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004); an exceptional area in an Indochinese context, that still supported significant Tiger numbers in 2008 (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010). The Nakai Plateau and the mountainous interior of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and a few other, localized, areas of Lao PDR, including the Dong Kalo tract of Xe Pian NPA, the Nam Hiang area of the Bolaven Plateau, and parts of Nam Kading NPA also seemed to support relatively high densities during the mid 1990s. The few sites resurveyed during 2004–2007 have in general shown major declines (e.g. Timmins and Robichaud 2005). There was not a single camera-trap photograph during fairly intensive camera-trapping in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2007, although the species has subsequently been found to persist in a few parts of the protected area (Johnson and Johnston 2007; W.G. Robichaud and Nam Theun Watershed Management Protection Authority pers. comm. 2008) and it is not clear whether quirks of camera-trap placement (e.g., hypothetically, a focus on slopes rather than valley bottoms) may have been a major contributor to the lack of photographs. The Nakai Plateau still supports noteworthy numbers in a Lao context, but even here there were signs of decline (Dersu 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014) and no Sambar were camera-trapped in Xe Sap NPA during relatively extensive camera-trapping (~40 sites, ~5,000 trap-nights) in 2012 and 2013 (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). Surprisingly, given the proximity to China and Viet Nam, a good population was found to persist in Phou Dendin NPA in the far north-east of Lao PDR in 2004–2005 (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). In sites surveyed since 2008 evidence for persistence has been found in most large forest blocks (e.g. &gt;50,000 ha), although nowhere common, but generally not in small and isolated fragments, while in many areas of the country evidence suggests increasing levels of hunting especially commercial scale snaring (SUFORD 2010, Duckworth in press, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2014, 2009, in press b, Woxvold 2009, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Viet Nam, in most of the northern highlands, in particular, and all other areas of Viet Nam to an increasing extent, Sambar is very rare or has been hunted out from many areas of otherwise suitable habitat (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999; Grieser Johns 2000; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014; B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping studies in Pu Mat National Park, Thua Thien Hue province and Quang Nam province between 1998 and 2007 recorded only a handful of records and local communities in all these areas report a major decline in numbers (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Greater than 19,000 camera-trap nights from &gt;100 locations in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves detected the species from only one location (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). With so many higher-profile species long listed as threatened on the Red List, many of them with restricted ranges, the status of Sambar in Viet Nam has largely been ignored, and the paucity of evidence during many surveys has rarely been highlighted in reviews. As with many large mammals, populations were thought to be best in southern parts of the country, but even here hunting pressure is high in most remaining forest areas, and Sambar is thought to be scarce to extirpated in most remaining forest areas (a high proportion of which is within protected areas) (Timmins in press a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). It was not considered at all common in surveys of several areas of prime habitat in Dak Lak Province in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997). In a three week survey of forest in western Dak Nong Province only a single Sambar was detected on the basis of signs, this despite the area being contiguous with Seima PF in Cambodia (Timmins in press a). It remains locally common in Cat Tien National Park (Polet and Ling 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), but this is very much the exception to the species status in almost all protected areas in Viet Nam (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, Sambar “appears to be at least relatively common in some areas, though entirely absent from others, a feature which appears to have a strong correlation to local hunting pressure. At the current rate of persecution, this species is likely to decline sharply over the next few years (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the 2008 assessment Sambar was considered “still widespread, although heavily targeted by hunters and most populations are now very depressed (Timmins and Men 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, Timmins 2006)”. However substantial declines have certainly occurred since that time (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), as a result of increasing hunting pressure, especially in the east because of Vietnamese driven trade (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Timmins in press a), but elsewhere because of increasing ease of access to forest areas as a result of infrastructure development, settlement of frontier forest areas and agriculture and forestry concession developments (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). <span lang=""EN-GB"">In Seima PF, Phnom Prich WS, and Mondulkiri PF Sambar densities are considered too low to allow density and population estimation, although behaviour is also thought to contribute to the low detection rate on line transects there (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The population is almost certainly smaller even than that of wild oxen, and probably numbers in the low hundreds of animals (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). Sambar densities are low throughout the Eastern Plains (e.g. Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011; Timmins and Ou Ratanak 2001), almost certainly a result of targeted hunting in combination with the ecological association of Sambar with ‘edge’-type habitats and riparian corridors. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the eastern plains of Cambodia, where populations of many other ungulates were and still are magnitudes more numerous than in other areas of Indochina, Sambar numbers are clearly low, almost certainly as a result of targeted hunting: numbers in some areas seem depressed even well below those of wild cattle (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014;&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Gray <em>et al. </em>2013, 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins and Ou 2001). Protection activities in a few localised areas appeared initially to have stabilized declines up to c. 2008, but this was an exception to a general scenario of rapid decline, and now it appears that even in these reasonably well managed areas with significant resources input into protection and law enforcement activities that hunting pressure is rising in intensity, presumably largely because of the increasing lucrative nature of the trade in wildlife, rather than a decrease in protection efforts, augmented somewhat by the greater connectivity and better infrastructure connecting wildlife sources to markets (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, J. Khamler pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). These declines are evidently faster and more recent than in either Lao PDR or Viet Nam, reflecting the rapid pace of change of economic and logistical factors in Cambodia since the mid 1990s. Since the species' assessment in 2008 this rate of decline has almost certainly increased, perhaps even by an order of magnitude (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The primary reason for this increase has been the rapid economic growth that Cambodia has seen in the intervening period, particularly the rapid development of agro-industry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). This by itself would not necessarily lead to major declines in Sambar, but the infrastructural development associated with agricultural concessions has created easy access to huge areas of formerly relatively remote forest areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Even protected areas are not secure, with legal concessions granted within the former boundaries of even those with strong international support (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2014). At the same time illegal exploitation of the rich natural resources of Cambodia has increased, as commodity values have increased, as access to these resources has increased and as regional cross-border natural resource trade networks have become stronger (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Recent studies have confirmed what was earlier suspected that Sambar populations even in some of the areas of best wildlife status are highly depressed, but more worryingly however there are no signs of a significant recovery in such areas and hunting pressure may in fact be increasing despite concerted resource investment in protected area management, particularly law enforcement strategies, from international NGOs (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2011; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; S. Brook pers. comm. 2014; J. Kamler pers. comm. 2014). Although the rates of decline have been increasing in Cambodia, concurrently as the numbers of animals remaining have decreased, the influence of the Cambodian population status on the global population trend has probably changed little (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> For a review of the species status in Peninsula Malaysia Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2014) considered that the rate of decline was sufficient to warrant an Endangered listing, i.e. a 50% or greater decline. This conclusion was based on several lines of evidence, most notably the results of camera-trapping surveys showing absence and or low densities in a majority of remaining forest areas, and rates of forest loss. Camera-trapping studies between 1998 and 2008 over more than 20,000 trap days, detected Sambar (68 photographs) in only 3 of 18 Permanent Reserved Forests, but detected the species in all five protected areas surveyed (346 photographs in c. 19,900 trap-days) (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">), however the species was only commonly detected (e.g. capture rate &gt;1/25 trap nights) in two PAs Taman Negara K Koh and Endau Rompin and one PRF Temenggor. Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) like the majority of the studies that formed part of the synthesis of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>(2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">) was specifically aimed at Tigers and their prey, and hence camera-traps were set specifically with Sambar detection in mind, the results are thus particularly informative of Sambar status; during the study Sambar was photographed at only one of the nine areas surveyed during 1997–1999, Temenggor, where it was the most commonly photographed mammal (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In more recent studies from 2009 to 2013 totalling more than 40,000 trap days focused on three national priority tiger conservation landscapes Sambar was detected by camera-trapping in only four of ten forest units surveyed, with presence confirmed in another through observational surveys of signs, but was only commonly detected in one, Royal Belum State Park (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">). The high incidence of muntjac and pig pictures in both earlier and later periods of survey clearly indicate that the results are indicative of Sambar status rather than an issue with camera-trapping methodology. &#160;In the 1990s, Sambar was found in only one of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas) in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves, making it the most localized mammal species visually detected on forest transects (Laidlaw 2000, K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 2014). The occupied site was a logged area (Laidlaw 2000).

Sambar was found to be present but uncommon in the remaining areas of Mulu National Park (Sarawak), Pulong Tau National Park (Sarawak), the Ulu Padas region (Sabah), the Ulu Trusan region (Sarawak), and the Ulu Baram (Sarawak) (Brodie <em>et al.</em> in press, <span lang=""EN-US"">J.

Sambar has been extirpated or persists only at extremely low densities in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia (Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006). An intensive survey of Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, found Sambar only once; this was stated to be a genuine reflection of actual rarity, and to result from intensive hunting at salt-licks (Meredith 1995). Across Sarawak and to a lesser extent Sabah it is seriously reduced by hunting (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2000, see Threats; A.C.

Hedges pers. comm. 2008), but in these areas it was recorded rather rarely by comparison with other ungulates. Sambar was nearly six times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting, and reduced populations overall (O'Brien&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003). In Way Kambas National Park the population is reportedly stable (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Overall in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Sambar is not under major threat except where forest is being converted (i.e. most of the lowlands). Reflecting this, E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) considered the status of Sambar, in suitable habitat, to be much more healthy there than in Cambodia and Viet Nam, although there is a significant market for Sambar antlers in Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"The Sambar extends from India and Sri Lanka east along the southern Himalayas (including Nepal and Bhutan) through much of south China (including Hainan Island) to Taiwan (where it occurs in the central and eastern parts; Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comms. 2008). Further south it occurs in Bangladesh, throughout mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, West Malaysia) and many of the main islands of the Greater Sundas (excepting Java): Sumatra, Siberut, Sipora, Pagi and Nias islands (all Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) (Grubb 2005). The current distribution is now highly fragmented in much of this range (see Population). Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) also listed the Philippines, but the Sambar does not occur there. A record from Ujung Kulon, Java, in van Schaik and Griffiths (1996: 107) is presumably an error for Javan Deer <em>R. timorensis</em>. The Sambar has been introduced widely outside its native range, e.g.: San Luis Obispo Country, California; the Gulf Prairies and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Ables and Ramsey 1974); the St. Vincent Islands, Franklin Country, Florida (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1990); Australia (Slee 1984, Freeland 1990); New Zealand (Kelton and Skipworth 1987); and Western Cape Province, South Africa (Lever 1985). These introduced populations are not included on the distribution map.","The Sambar is hunted for sport, food, medicinal products and other purposes. It is uncertain how many captive animals are kept within the native range, potentially larger herds occur in countries where introduced, and the comparative contributions of wild and captive sourced products to markets is unknown - the markets may be somewhat separate.",Terrestrial,"The Sambar is found in many protected areas throughout its range, although in most of these areas this legal status has not stemmed declines and local extinctions from hunting. Similarly, although it is protected from hunting by legislation, even outside protected areas, in most or all range states, these laws are challenging to enforce, given the trade demand for meat and antlers (GMA Indonesia Workshop).&#160;In Sarawak, Borneo, unfortunately,&#160;Sambar&#160;is not on the protected list of Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1998 (a,b) (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Currently the law has a strong protective effect in Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008) and in various protected areas of India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, Sambar declines have lagged behind those of other sympatric deer (excepting muntjacs). There is no doubt that within a decade or two Sambar will be, like Hog Deer and Eld’s Deer are already, almost absent from South-east Asia unless effective protection from trade-driven hunting is instituted. In India the species’s status is less grim, and this is dependent upon continuation of the current protected areas system, and the expansion of effective threat reduction into a greater proportion of protected areas: in many Indian protected areas, poaching is rampant and in such vulnerable areas Sambar numbers are still declining. Given the major challenges combating hunting of such a desired animal, long-term survival is most realistic in large protected areas (exceeding 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> where possible), lacking people living within them, with an adequate number of motivated and capable staff (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008, A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). The precise ways for protected areas to function effectively in the conservation of large mammals depend upon their own specific circumstances, but field presence of staff, dispersed across the area, is likely to be important in almost every area. For example, Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2006) found in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, that encounter rates of tracks and signs of Sambar (and other large mammals) decreased with distance from ranger substations. Deep inside the forest to the south and east, far away from ranger substations, Sambar was locally extinct. Similar patterns are shown by current Sambar distributions in other Thai protected areas such as Khao Sok, Phu Khieo and Kaeng Krachan (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Sambar (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Sambar populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that outmigration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai. Most of the remaining forest within its Chinese range are already established as nature reserves (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Sambar population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Sambar presence through its historical range, to preserve Sambar genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/><p>The most important conservation measure for Sambar in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, and in Thailand it is to to expand government-funded park protection and ranger training programmes outside of the few parks which are currently well supported in the Western Forest Complex. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Sambar conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Nam Et–Phou Louey, and Nakai–Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species, but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Sambar conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Sambar as the focus for efforts.<br/> <br/> Captive breeding is being developed in East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). A captive herd of 223 heads in 10 ha enclosure was established in 1998 in Penajam District, as a pilot project. Several private herds exist in the province, such as at Bearau and at Nunukan, both with more than 20 heads (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Captive Sambar herds are also widespread in mainland Asia.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It is also common in its native range in East Asian countries. Although subject to some possible localized declines, there is no evidence to suggest that the species is at any risk of extinction, and is listed as Least Concern.","Two features are typical of the habitat of Raccoon Dogs: 1) they are often found near water; and 2) during autumn they are more or less dependent on fruits and berries, which affect their habitat selection. In Japan, their habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to subalpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitat and uses less <em>Cryptomeria</em> plantation throughout year, while riparian areas are often used (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b). In urban areas, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover (Yamamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the Russian Far East, the Raccoon Dog favours open landscape, especially damp meadows and agricultural land and avoids dark forests (Judin 1977). <br/><br/>In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favour moist meadows and other habitats with abundant undergrowth, mixed forests and shores of rivers and lakes, especially in early summer (Korneev 1954, Nasimovic and Isakov 1985, Kauhala 1996). In late summer and autumn, they favour moist heaths with abundant berries (Morozov 1947, Kauhala 1996). However, in the Finnish archipelago, they live in barren pine forests where they feed on crowberries (<em>Empetrum nigrum</em>) (Kauhala and Auniola 2000).&#160;In Finland, generally the best landscape for Raccoon Dogs is a landscape with abundant undergrowth, a mosaic of moist forests, damp meadows, gardens and agricultural area (Kauhala and Auttila 2010, Kauhala <em>et al</em>. 2010). The population is sparse in large coniferous forests.","Raccoon Dogs are still persecuted across much of their native range as a pest species. They also may be affected locally by predation from feral dogs, road kills, and from epidemics (including scabies and canine distemper virus), and in some cases may be declining due to extreme habitat loss. The Raccoon Dog is an important vector and victim of rabies in Europe, with increasing significance towards the east and north.","Outside of Japan, where the species is common, there is no information on abundance in their native range. Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted that in China they probably still exist in the wild in parts of Guangxi and Guangdong, but are otherwise likely to be threatened. Population estimates have never been&#160;conducted in Japan, but indirect indices (e.g., road-kills per km of the National Express-ways and harvest&#160;density per prefecture), suggest that relative abundance is high in south-western parts of Japan (i.e., Kyushu, Shikoku, and Chugoku) and low in Hokkaido, Chubu, and extremely urban areas (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b; and see&#160;Table 5.4.2 therein). In Viet Nam, the southerly extent of their range, there is very little information available on their status. A survey undertaken in 2004 in five areas in Na Hang District, Tuyen Quang Province, recorded two captive young animals in Na Vang village after apparently having been taken from a small cave (presumably a den) in Lung Nhoi area (Le Trong Trai <em>et al</em>. 2004), but there is otherwise no other recent information.<br/><br/>The species is common in the introduced range; for example, in Finland the adult population consists of 110,000-120,000 individuals (hunting bag 160,000-170,000 individuals each year). The autumn population, including the young of the year would be about 320,000.",Stable,"The native range of this species extends from northern Indochina (ranging as far south as north-eastern Viet Nam, east of the Red River, and southern Yunnan province in China) through the eastern provinces of China and the Korean Peninsula to the south-east corner of Russia and Mongolia. In the Japanese Archipelago, the species is present throughout Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Awaji island, Sado island and other islets of Japan except those south of Kyushu (e.g., Okinawa islands, Nansei islands, Miyako islands and Ogasawara islands). Introduced to Yakushima island (S. Azuma, in Kauhala and Saeki 2004b).&#160;Absent from Hainan and Taiwan, Province of China.&#160;<br/><br/>The species was introduced in the early to mid-part of the 20th Century to European parts of the former Soviet Union and since then the species has become widespread in northern and eastern Europe, thriving in a landscape which is a mosaic of moist forests with abundant undergrowth, damp meadows and gardens (Kauhala<em> et al</em>. 2010). The northern limit of distribution lies in areas where the mean temperature of the year is just above 0°C, the snow cover &lt;800 mm, the duration of the snow cover &lt;175 days and the length of the growing season &gt;135 days (for example, in Finland the northern limit of permanent distribution is between 65°N and the Arctic Circle). In recent years, when winters have become milder, the Raccoon Dog has expanded its range northwards (in Finland, up to 67°N). Raccoon Dogs appear to have been expanding their range in recent times, including a record in 2002 from the central part of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (at the time the southernmost point of its European range; Ćirović 2006) and a road-kill in south-eastern Spain in 2008 (Kauhala and&#160;Kowalczyk 2011). The latter authors provide a detailed review of the history of colonization of the Raccoon Dog in Europe.","The Russians introduced Raccoon Dogs into the wild in the European part of the former Soviet Union because they wanted to establish a valuable new fur animal in the wild. Raccoon Dog furs continue to be commercially sold, although today they are produced in fur farms. While the species is still commonly farmed for fur in Finland (albeit less intensively than 20-30 years ago), Raccoon Dogs are no longer farmed in Sweden or Hungary, where the last fur farm was closed in 1995. In Japan, Raccoon Dog fur is also used in the production of calligraphic brushes, stuffed animals, and other products. Today, Raccoon Dogs are mainly hunted because they are considered pests.&#160;In Japan, legal culling increased from the 1970s to 15,176 animals in 2012. However, the numbers harvested has declined from a peak of 76,000 in 1981. In China, about 15 million Raccoon Dogs were held by fur farmers in 2010, and China is the largest producer and exporter of Raccoon Dog fur in the world (Petry and Liting 2010). In Finland, the yearly hunting bag for 2013 was about 160,000 animals (Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute 2014). In Poland, where Raccoon Dogs are hunted from August to March, the annual bag was 450–600 in the early 1990s, but more than 11,000 are now hunted annually (Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011). In Germany, 30,000 Raccoon Dogs were hunted in the hunting season of 2008/2009 (Anon., in Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In many countries in the introduced part of their range, where the Raccoon Dog is legally hunted, hunting is permitted year round (e.g., Sweden, Hungary). However, in Finland, females with pups are protected in May, June and July, and in Belarus hunting is allowed from 1 October to the end of February. In Japan, hunting/trapping of the species requires a licence or other form of permission and can only occur within the designated hunting season (November 15 to February 15). The Raccoon Dog on Mukojima island (18.4 km²), Hiroshima prefecture, is designated as a natural monument under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, and permission from the Director-General of the Agency of Cultural Affairs is required for capturing the animals on the island.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Raccoon Dogs occur in national parks and other wildlife protection areas in Japan, where hunting and some other activities are prohibited.

Currently, the population is estimated to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals, and is thought likely to experience a continuing decline nearing 10% over the 10-12 years (three generations) largely as a result of ongoing habitat loss and degradation combined with persecution, and it is here provisionally listed as Near Threatened, based on approximating listing as threatened under criterion C1.","The Sechuran Fox occupies habitats ranging from sandy deserts with low plant density to agricultural lands and dry forests (Cabrera 1931, Huey 1969, Langguth 1975).&#160;The species is often observed in rural areas and disturbed environments from Piura department to La Libertad department in Peru.&#160;Occurs from sea-level to above 1,000 m, and perhaps as much as 2,000 m (Cossios 2009). It is an opportunistic omnivore, capable of being strictly vegetarian when necessary, and likely can survive with limited access to water (Cossios 2009).","The most important threats to this species are from the market for handicrafts and amulets and from persecution because of damage to livestock. In Peru, the typical attitude towards this species is one of persecution (68.3% of correspondents) or indifference (31.7%). The stated reasons for persecution were due to damage on domestic fowl and guinea pigs (65% of correspondents), the consumption of vegetal or stored goods (13.3%), and the belief of goat predation (10%) (Asa and Cossíos 2004). The Sechuran Fox also faces some pressure in agricultural zones and from urbanization and habitat degradation; indeed, habitat reduction or loss is considered the main threat to this species in Ecuador (Tirira 2001, Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011).","This species was judged by Grimwood (1969) as being abundant at the time and not in need of protection. The Sechuran Fox is uncommon in Ecuador, where it is considered to be in decline (Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011). Asa <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated the total population to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals, but these numbers must be regarded with caution since they are supported by very little empirical data. Surveys based on footprints in Coto de Caza El Angolo in Piura, Peru, recorded an average of 12.6 foxes/km (CDC 1989) and an evaluation in San Pedro de Vice mangroves (Piura) estimated a population of 18-23 individuals in 3,013 ha (Chávez-Villavicencio <em>et al</em>. 2015), giving a population density of 0.6-0.76 individuals per km².",Unknown,"The Sechuran Fox can be found in the coastal zones of north-western Peru and south-western Ecuador, between about 3 and 12°S (Asa and Cossios 2004, Cossios 2009). In Ecuador, it has been observed in Manabi, Santa Elena, Guayas, El Oro, Azuay and Loja provinces (Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Peru, it is distributed on the western slope of the Andes between the frontier with Ecuador and Lima. Specimens that have been recorded further south may be the Chilla&#160;<em>Lycalopex griseus</em> or another species as yet undescribed (E. Vivar pers. comm).","Illegal sale of pups, of amulets made from body parts, and of handicrafts made from fur occurs principally in the markets of Tumbes, Chiclayo, Piura and Lima city in Peru. The most common type of handicraft made with fox parts consists of preserved adult animals in a ""sitting"" position. This activity is limited almost exclusively to the department of Piura. The practice of magic-religious rituals by shamans involving preserved Sechuran Fox specimens or parts is the principal human use of this species in Peru. The specimens are used to attract ""good spirits"" or ""positive energies"" during premonition rituals or to manufacture amulets (called seguros) with different purposes.

Rovero pers. obs. 2002-2014).",Unknown,"Servaline Genet ranges from southern Cameroon, south of the Sanaga River, and Central African Republic and southwards in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of the Congo to southern Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, and possibly also Burundi (unconfirmed record from Kibira forest; Wilson, 1990).&#160;There are discontinuous populations in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania, including the North Pare Mtns, Udzungwa Mtns, East Usambara Mtns, Uluguru Mtns, Rubeho Mtns, and Nguru North and South Mtns (Rovero <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160;Cordero and Seltzer 2012,&#160;Van Rompaey and Colyn 2013). De Luca and Mpunga (2013) did not camera-trap or observe the species in Mt Rungwe Nature Reserve and Kitulo National Park, south-west Tanzania. Similarly, a recent camera-trapping study did not yield any picture of Servaline Genet from the Mlele Beekeeping Zone and the northern part of Rukwe Game Reserve, western Tanzania (Fischer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Gaubert <em>et al</em>. (2006) gave museum records from north of the Sanaga River, from several additional localities in Tanzania, as well as from two localities in south-eastern DR Congo (these are not mapped). The species is present on Zanzibar (Van Rompaey and Colyn 1998, Goldman and Winther-Hansen 2003). It is recorded from almost sea level to 3,500 m a.s.l. on Mt Elgon, Kenya (Kingdon 1977) and perhaps to elevations above 4,400 m a.s.l. in eastern DR Congo (Verschuren 1972).","Servaline Genets are common in bushmeat markets, as in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), and the skins are used for wrist-bracelets and dancing hats, and for loin-cloths among both Mbuti and Ba’aka pygmies (Van Rompaey and Colyn 2013).",Terrestrial,"Servaline Genet is present in several protected areas across the range, including <em>G. s. archeri</em> in Jozani–Chakwa Bay&#160;National Park, Zanzibar (Goldman and Winther-Hansen 2003, D.

97164299,16218,Pardofelis marmorata,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Marbled Cat is listed as Near Threatened although it is close to qualifying as Vulnerable under criteria A and C. The change in status from Vulnerable in the 2008 assessment to Near Threatened must not be taken to reflect an actual increase in population nor a reduction of threats, rather the increasing number of camera trap surveys across Asia have, in recent years, confirmed the presence of previously only suspected populations and in some areas have resulted in a higher than expected number of detections and individuals. Despite this, the Marbled Cat remains little known and, across its range, is recorded relatively infrequently, which has hampered efforts to accurately assess its status, so much so that the assessors could not make a unanimous decision, with some assessors believing that maintaining the status as Vulnerable was more appropriate, we therefore report Near Threatened as the view of the majority. Current data suggest the Marbled Cat is forest dependent but does persist in degraded forest. It is also present over a wide elevation range and in rugged areas – areas in which forest loss is slower than average for the region. Marbled Cats are also threatened by hunting, but currently quantitative data is lacking and we cannot assess the impact this is having on the population. There are no published estimates of population density for the Marbled Cat, however, across its range, density probably varies considerably, but given the large range (currently estimated at roughly 1,500,000 km²) the population density needs to be below one individual per 100 km² to qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), this seems implausible in several areas. In summary, the population is probably slightly too large and declining too slowly (<em>c</em>. 25%) to qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>If future research challenges these key assumptions (presence in rugged terrain, over wide elevations, large geographic range, tolerance to some habitat degradation) or provides evidence of a substantially fragmented population, extremely low population density, heavy hunting pressure, or stronger support of the proposed species split, the status will need revising and it is likely that it would then qualify for Vulnerable, probably under criterion C.","<p>Current data suggest that the Marbled Cat is forest dependent, primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous-evergreen tropical forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and may prefer hill forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The increasing use of camera traps throughout its range is revealing detections from disturbed areas (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mathai <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2010), including recently logged forest (e.g. Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010), but surveys of oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo have not detected marbled cats within the plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Yue <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grassman and Tewes (2002) reported a pair of adult Marbled Cats in a salt lick in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat has never been intensively studied, but Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005) report a preliminary home range estimate of 5.3 km² for an adult female who was radio-collared and tracked for one month in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park. There is no detailed information regarding Marbled Cat diet, but it probably preys primarily on rodents, including squirrels (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and birds.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat appears to be primarily diurnal (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><em>&#160;</em>2013).</p>","<p>  The Marbled Cat is forest dependent and forest loss and degradation is continuing across its range from logging and expansion of human settlements and agriculture, including oil palm plantations. The Marbled Cat is valued for skin, meat and bones, although it is infrequently observed in the wildlife trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, it is possible that illegal killing and trade is underreported compared to other species. Targeted and indiscriminate snaring are prevalent throughout much of the range and likely to pose a significant threat. They have been reported as poultry pests (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006) which also results in retaliatory killing. Records of hunting and skins are known from several areas in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India - Vijaynagar-Gandhigram in Changlang district (A. Datta unpubl. data), West Kameng district (Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006), Pakke Kessang, East Kameng district (Lyngdoh <em>et al.</em> 2011), Ziro valley, Lower Subansiri (Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2013) and from Khonoma in Nagaland (Grewal <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no population density estimates for the Marbled Cat. In most surveys, detection rates tend to be lower for this species than some sympatric felids such as the Asiatic Golden Cat (e.g. Pusparini <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gumal <em>et al</em>. 2014, Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014) and both species of Clouded Leopard, but higher than others such as the Bay Cat (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). However, in some surveys, when individual animals have been identified, a similar number or even a higher number of individual Marbled Cats compared to Clouded Leopards have been found (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). It is therefore possible that low detection rates may under some circumstances arise from cameras placed inappropriately for Marbled Cats, it is also likely that the population density will vary greatly across the range and it is important to note that many surveys have resulted in very few detections. However, unless population densities are very low, or the distribution extremely patchy it is likely that the total population numbers over 10,000 mature individuals, although this is certainly in decline.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marbled Cat is found from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal eastwards into southwest China, southwards throughout mainland Southeast Asia and on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

97165437,4038,Catopuma temminckii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is assessed as Near Threatened. However, there is a general paucity of data for this species, with no density estimates or population data, making an assessment of the true status of the species difficult. The data that we do have indicate that the species has likely experienced population declines of over 20%, and approaching 30% in recent years due to extensive habitat loss and poaching across their range. This pattern is likely to continue in the future, and indicates that the Asiatic Golden Cat is very close to qualifying for a Vulnerable status under criterion A.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat has been documented from twelve countries in Southeast Asia. Yet, despite this fairly wide distribution, its presence in India, Bangladesh and Nepal is limited and patchy (Datta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, with records in both China and Viet Nam declining drastically in recent years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007; Gray <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm.). It has not been recorded in Viet Nam since 2005, and extensive surveys carried out&#160; in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi Provinces of China have recorded Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Beijing Forestry University unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration unpublished data). It is likely to be extirpated from these two countries in the very near future. The Asiatic Golden Cat is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but the is thought to be experiencing population declines in these areas as well (Linkie and Ridout 2009, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015, K. Kawanishi pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm).<br/><br/>The most significant threats to the Asiatic Golden Cat are thought to be habitat loss and poaching. Although the species has occasionally been recorded from degraded or altered habitats, it is primarily a forest dependent species, and thus is threatened by the significant habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed slightly, they are still among the highest in the world at roughly one million hectares/year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO 2011). Land conversion is also a threat to the Asiatic Golden Cat, and even in countries such as Bhutan, where the species is thought to enjoy a relatively protected status, an increase in hyrdopower projects has the potential to negatively impact the species. Poaching of the species is thought to be increasing in many areas, as it is often targeted for the sale of its pelt and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Khan 2008, Aiyadurai <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Pusparini <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm., P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm., S. Mukherjee&#160;pers. comm., T. Gray&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm., A. Datta&#160;pers. comm., D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Increasingly, the species may be targeted as a substitute for Tiger pelts and bones. In Viet Nam, there have been several incidences of confiscated Asiatic Golden Cat pelts that were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). It is also the victim of indiscriminate snaring and hunting in some areas (Holden 2001, Khan 2008, D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Finally, there are indications that the species is increasingly being killed in retribution for preying on livestock (mainly poultry) (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The lack of reliable density estimates severely limit our ability to accurately assess the population status and trend of the species. However, the decrease, or sudden absence, of Asiatic Golden Cat records from many areas, in combination with an apparently increased level of poaching, lead us to believe that the population is declining across its range. More rigorous scientific data for this species is needed, and may provide a strong basis on which to base change in status to Vulnerable.","The Asiatic Golden Cat is primarily found in forested areas, particularly tropical and subtropical moist evergreen forests, mixed evergreen forests, and dry deciduous forests. (Nowell and Jackson 1996, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Two radio collared individuals (a male and a female) in Thailand occurred most often in closed forest habitats (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). However, the species has also been recorded from open areas such as shrub or grasslands, or open rocky areas, and from degraded or fragmented forest landscapes (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013). A radio collared female in Sumatra was frequently recorded outside of a protected area in remnant fragments of forest located between coffee plantations (McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>Records of the Asiatic Golden Cat have a wide altitudinal variation. The species was documented at elevations up to 3,960 m in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve Sikkim, India, at 3,738 m in the Jigme Sigye Wangchuk National Park in Bhutan, at 2,896 m in Trongsa, and at 3,900 m in Wangduephodrang (Wang 2007, Bashir <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, S. Dahal pers. comm.). However, in some areas it appears to be more common in lowland forests. In Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, it was only recorded by camera traps at low elevations.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat is remarkably polymorphic in its pelage. The most common coat color is golden or red brown, but it may also be dark brown or even grey. Melanistic individuals have been reported and may be predominant in some areas of its range (Holden 2001). There is also a spotted form which is called an “ocelot morph” due to its ocelot-like rosettes. To date, this form has been reported from China (in Sichuan and Tibet) and from Bhutan (Wang 2007). The most distinct features of this cat are the white lines bordered with dark brown to black running across the cheeks, from the nostrils towards the cheeks, at the inner corner of the eyes, and up the crown. The rounded ears have black backs with a grey spot. The chest, abdomen and inner side of the upper legs are white with light speckling. The legs and tail are grey to black at the distal ends. The terminal half of the tail is white on the underside and is often carried with the end curled dorsally. Males are larger than females.<br/><br/>Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Asiatic Golden Cat. It was once thought to be primarily nocturnal, however, recent data indicates that it may be more crepuscular or diurnal. Two radio-collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park showed mainly diurnal and crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In addition, most camera trap photographs of Asiatic Golden Cats in the Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks in Sumatra were taken during the day (Holden 2001, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The home ranges of two radio collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park were 33 km² (female) and 48 km² (male) and overlapped in significantly (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>One confirmed scat contained the remains of Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Scats from Sumatra contained rat and muntjac remains, and the stomach contents of a carcass in Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park included the remains of a small snake (Grassman 1998).","As a forest dependent species, the Asiatic Golden Cat is threatened by habitat loss throughout it's range. Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed substantially, they are still among the highest in the world (FAO 2011). An increasing number of hydropower projects in countries such as Bhutan, also have the potential to negatively impact the species. In addition, the species is threatened by increasing levels of illegal hunting and poaching for consumption, and for the sale of pelts and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Khan 2008, H. Rahman pers. comm., P. Riordan pers. comm., S. Mukherjee pers. comm., T. Gray pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm.). There is thought to be some level of poaching or hunting of the species in every country across its range. Pelts have been recorded being traded along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and in Sumatra (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Pusparini <em>et al.</em> 2014), and skins are reported from several sites in northeast India (Aiyadurai <em>et al.</em> 2010, A. Datta pers. comm.). Poaching pressure is particularly high in China and Viet Nam, where the species may soon face extirpation.  In Viet Nam, there is some evidence that the species is increasingly targeted as a substitute for Tiger skins and parts, as Tigers become more difficult to obtain. There have been several incidences of confiscated Golden Cat pelts which were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox pers. comm.). Snaring appears to be on the rise across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and constitutes a major threat to the species D. Willcox pers. comm.). In Bangladesh, several recent specimens indicate that the species is  commonly hunted by indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Conflict with humans due to livestock depredation is also thought to be an issue for the species. Retribution killing of the species in response to chicken depredation was recorded in Sumatra (McCarthy 2013).","A lack of density estimates across the range makes it difficult to accurately assess the true population status of the species. Owing to somewhat similar camera trap encounter rates, the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to have comparable abundances to those of sympatric felids (e.g. <em>Neofelis nebulosa, Neofelis diardi, Pardofelis marmorata</em>). However, some surveys have recorded the Golden Cat more frequently than sympatric felid species, while others have recorded the it less frequently, so their relative abundance likely varies significantly across their range (Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Rao <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Mishra <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Bashir <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In addition, it is important to consider that the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to be mainly terrestrial, which may influence the number of camera trap photos recorded in comparison to more arboreal felid species such as <em>Neofelis diardi</em>, <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>&#160;and <em>Pardofelis marmorata</em>.",Decreasing,"The Asiatic Golden Cat has been recorded rarely and patchily from the Northeastern states of India (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim), through eastern Bangladesh (Northeast and the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and eastern Nepal (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lyngdoh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lalthanpuia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Borah <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Velho 2013, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, and records in Viet Nam and south China have decreased drastically in recent years, with strong indications that the species may face extirpation there in the next several years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan pers. comm.). It is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia (Tempa <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, T. Dhendup&#160;pers. comm., K. Kawanishi&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm.). It is widely reported from the island of Sumatra, but not present on other Indonesian islands (Ridout and&#160;Linkie 2009, Sunarto 2011, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>This distribution may be somewhat generous, particularly in China and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam there have been several Asiatic Golden Cat pelts confiscated recently in local markets, however, they are of undetermined origin. A live individual has not been recorded in the country since 2005, despite numerous camera trap studies. It is likely that the species has been extirpated from most of the country due to widespread and indiscriminate snaring. In China, extensive surveys carried out with local protected area and provincial government teams in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces have recorded the Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data). It is likely that the species is, or will soon be, extirpated from large areas of its range in south China as well.",,Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is listed under Appendix I of CITES (as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Catopuma temminckii</span>), and is officially protected over most of its range by national legislation.

97204446,15309,Leopardus colocolo,Near Threatened,,2016,2014-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Pampas Cat is generally rare or very rare (0.05-0.2 individuals/km²) and localized throughout most of its range, and appears to be declining in several parts of its extent of occurrence because of extensive loss or reduction in quality of its habitat. Predation by dogs, hunting and road kills are additional threats. Population decline caused by loss of habitat is widespread and is a primary concern. Although little data is available on the rate of loss of natural habitats across the Pampas Cat range, we have some information from the Gran Chaco region that covers a large portion of Pampas Cat’s distribution range. The Gran Chaco forest extends over parts of northern Argentina, western Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, and western Brazil and occupies an approximate area of 1,141,000 km². Deforestation started in the 1970s and accelerated in 2002-2006. Following the global increase in commodity prices, it is likely that the rates of deforestation have maintained or increased in the last decade. Based on the data from the dry Chaco region, a portion of the whole Gran Chaco covering 790,000 km²&#160; the yearly rate of transformation of forest into cropland (a habitat type where Pampas Cat do not occur) ranges from 0.63 to 1.75% (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2010). Thus, adopting a generation length of seven years (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) and assuming that transformed habitat becomes unavailable to the Pampas Cat, populations of this species could be suffering a 36.5% declination rate over three generations.<br/><br/>Another issue is that possibly the Pampas Cat should not be assessed as a single evolutionary unit. The taxonomy of this species is not yet resolved but the available evidence (morphological, genetic and ecological) indicates that there are clear differences among regional subpopulations, which have been proposed to represent distinct subspecies or even species. It is reasonable to consider the conservation status of these regional populations separately, because there may be little (or even no) historical and/or current gene flow among some of them, implying that limited genetic connectivity may further threaten the long term viability of the species as a whole.<br/><br/>Because of all the above and because the reasons for its rarity and population numbers are not known, the limited information available indicates Near Threatened as the most likely category (it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2c). Nevertheless, it may qualify as Vulnerable in the near future and hence requires monitoring.","The Pampas Cat has a wide distribution outside the moist forests of South America, being associated with more open habitats. It typically inhabits dry scrub and grassland, but can also be found in dry woodland as well as swampy wetland and rocky areas (Silveira 1995, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Pereira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Tellaeche 2015). Its prey includes small mammals as well as ground-dwelling birds (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Silveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). In the high Andes the diet is based on mountain viscacha and small rodents (Walker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Napolitano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Fajardo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In Brazil's Emas National Park, Pampas cats are primarily diurnal with some crepuscular and occasionally nocturnal activity. Home ranges (90% MCP) averaged 19.47 +/- 3.64 km² (Silveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). In the High Andes 71% of camera trap photos were taken at night and more than 20% during the day (Lucherini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009) and average home range size (95% Kernel) was 14.9 km² (Tellaeche 2015).","Habitat loss (to agricultural cropland) and degradation (by livestock grazing) is considered the major threat to this species throughout most of its range. Retaliatory killing for poultry depredation is also a threat, as are road kills.<br/><br/>In the High Andes of Bolivia and Peru the Pampas Cat is threatened by decreasing habitat quality caused by increased anthropogenic modification. In these regions, it is also actively persecuted by local people and often killed by dogs.<br/><br/>In Argentina, extensive habitat loss/modification due to the expansion of the agriculture frontier, mining, and oil extraction is the major threat.<br/><br/>The biggest threat to the species in Brazil is habitat loss, especially because of silviculture and agriculture expansion, as well as habitat conversion/degradation, mostly through fire. Given its rarity in Brazil, road kills are also considered a threat for some populations. In the Brazilian Pampas, predation by domestic dogs and hunting due to real or perceived conflicts, a problem that apparently has not been detected in the Cerrado yet (where it would be more incidental than widespread). A zone of hybridization between <em>L. colocolo</em> and <em>L. tigrinus</em> has been demonstrated by genetic analysis in central Brazil (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>In Peru, it is actively persecuted as it often kills chickens of local people, and is also impacted by dogs. Forest loss appears to be also an important threat.","The Pampas Cat populations living in the High Andes and Puna eco-regions appear to be able to reach relatively high densities (0.74-0.78 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) in the most productive habitat patches (Gardner <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The population appears to be stable in these regions of Argentina and in slight decline in Bolivia and Peru because of decreasing habitat quality caused by increased anthropogenic modification.<br/><br/>The Pampas Cat is a naturally rare species in most of Patagonia, where records of its presence are scarce in comparison with those of other felids (e.g. Geoffroy´s Cat, Puma).<br/><br/>In the Argentine Mesopotamia (Corrientes province), a couple of records (road-killed animals) were obtained during the last decade, but almost no evidence was recorded through camera trapping for the Iberá wetlands in spite of intensive trapping effort, thus suggesting that the species is rare in this region.<br/><br/>The Pampas Cat appears to be declining in central Argentina (Cordoba, San Luis), mainly due to habitat modification (i.e. soybean crop expansion), and is regionally extinct in the Pampas grasslands, where it only occurs in the southern and dry portion (Pereira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002 and recent unpublished surveys). In the Argentine Espinal, population numbers are low (0.11-0.17 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup>, lower than for the Geoffroy’s Cat, Caruso <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and distribution is largely limited to grassland habitats that are threatened by human activities. Pampas cat are similarly rare in the adjacent southern part of the Monte eco-region (Pereira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Pampas Cat records are very scarce in the Yungas eco-region of NW Argentina, where it is limited to the high-altitude grasslands (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>A survey on small cats has found no records of Pampas Cats in the Bolivian Chaco dry forest (Cuellar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Brazil, the Pampas Cat inhabits open areas, such as the grasslands of the Pampas, the marshy Pantanal, and particularly the savannas of the Cerrado (Araujo Bagno 2004). The species is considered typically rare and with low population densities, typically of 0.01–0.05 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (or lower), throughout these regions, but may be relatively common in a few areas, usually protected, such as Emas National Parks in the Cerrado (Godoi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and Mirador State Park, where densities of 0.1–0.2 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> are reached (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>In the Brazilian Pampas (southern portion of Rio Grande do Sul [RS] state), this felid is considered to occur only in well-preserved habitats areas (whose remaining area covers ca. 81,500 km²), and is always rarer than Geoffroy’s Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and population decline is expected to be 14% in the next 21 years or three generations (assuming the same generation length of seven years). Because of this, the species was considered Vulnerable (C1) in Brazil (Queirolo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The situation is thought to be the same in Uruguay.<br/><br/>An interesting point revealed by recent molecular studies is that the populations in RS state (Brazilian pampas) and Uruguay are genetically distinct from those present in the Brazilian Cerrado and also from Argentinean populations, indicating that they have been demographically isolated for a considerable period (Santos, Trigo and Eizirik, in preparation). Such a result indicates that this region constitutes a distinct conservation unit for this species, which should be taken into consideration when assessing its overall status.<br/><br/>In Peru, the Pampas Cat is generally uncommon or rare. A seemingly separate subpopulation of Pampas Cat occurs in the Tumbesian region of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Individuals here are small and well-marked compared with the Andean form. This form inhabits mainly forested habitats, favoring dense vegetation along permanent water-courses and even in mangroves. It also occurs in agricultural fields, especially sugar cane plantations and in sparse desert habitats with little vegetation along the coast where shorebirds congregate. In this region, the high level of human impacts and settlement has resulted in widespread forest loss and the Pampas Cat is now extremely rare, being primarily found in protected areas.<br/><br/>Most of its subpopulations, which could in fact end up being considered as genetically different species, would be Vulnerable individually.",Decreasing,"The Pampas Cat, named after Argentine grasslands, ranges throughout most of Argentina and Uruguay beyond into the dry forests (chaco, cerrado) of Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and north through the Andes mountain chain through Ecuador and possibly marginally into southwestern Colombia (Silveira 1995, Ruiz-Garcia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Dotta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>The suggestion by Pereira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2002) that the species can be considered extinct in the Pampas of central Argentina has been confirmed by more recent surveys.<br/><br/>The most recent information indicates that this species is rare throughout a very large portion of its distribution range, such as the Patagonia, Monte, Espinal, Yungas, and Mesopotamia in Argentina, the Pampas and Pantanal in Brazil, the dry forests of Bolivia, as well as in Uruguay and Peru.","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indistinctively. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;<em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">.

97212355,11509,Leopardus pardalis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Ocelot has a wide distribution, from northern Argentina to the southwestern United States, being the most common felid species in most of the tropical and subtropical habitats of the Neotropics; it is listed as Least Concern. Densities seem to increase with rainfall and decrease with latitude, with the highest densities in tropical areas (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2008). Even though there are indications of specific population declines, these do not seem to affect the species to the point of categorizing it under any threat category rangewide. Its extensive occurrence in Brazil, added to the remaining area of present distribution allows an effective population of &gt;40,000 mature individuals (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2013). At least in some areas of the Amazon basin, populations are apparently healthy and stable. The species is, nevertheless, impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, intense logging activities, vehicle collisions and poaching (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2008, Payan <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia, Ocelots manage to survive in oil palm landscapes and extensive cattle ranches in the llanos and Inter-Andean valleys (Boron and Payan 2013, Diaz-Pulido and Payan 2011). In Argentina, the species still is found in all the subtropical area and although it is affected by poaching and logging (Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, 2008, 2010), a total of 1,500 to 8,000 individuals is estimated for this country at the southern range of the species (Aprile <em>et al.</em> 2012). Populations of northeastern Mexico and Texas have experienced dramatic declines and the genetic impacts of isolation are apparent, particularly in Texas (Janecka <em>et al.</em> 2011 and Janecka <em>et al.</em> 2014). The number of Ocelots in Texas is believed to be between 50 – 80 individuals. These areas will certainly need attention or Ocelots are likely to be extirpated there.","The species occupies a wide spectrum of habitats types, ranging from scrublands to tropical rain forests. What all these habitats have in common is a well-structured vegetation cover (Emmons 1988, Emmons <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Ocelots were recorded in mangrove forests, coastal marshes, savanna grasslands, thorn scrubs, and tropical and subtropical forest (primary, secondary, evergreen, seasonal and montane). The species typically occurs at elevations below 3,000 m but there are occasional reports of the species up to 3,000 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>The Ocelot is a medium sized felid (11 kg), with a litter size of 1.4 kittens (1–4), and typically nocturno-crepuscular activity, but that could also be active during daytime (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Di Bitetti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Throughout much of its range tends to be the most abundant cat species. The Ocelot also reaches higher density estimates than its sympatric smaller species and was suggested that also negatively impact its small guild members (Di Bitetti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). The species use similar habitat and show similar abundance patterns than Jaguars and Pumas and appear not to be affected by these species (Di Bitetti et al 2010, Davis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011)&#160; Its diet includes small mammals, birds and reptiles, but include also larger sized prey (&gt;800 g), such as agoutis, armadillos, pacas, monkeys, etc. that in some areas can constitute the most important items (Crawshaw 1995, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Moreno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Bianchi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010)<br/><br/>The home ranges of males are larger than the ranges of the sympatric females, but high variation exist on the size between regions (Dillon and Kelly 2008).&#160; The largest home ranges (43 km² for males and 16 km² for females) were observed in Subtropical forest of Brazil and Argentina (Crawshaw 1995) and the smallest (2 to 6 km² for males and 1 to 3 km² for females) were observed in Texas (US), Brazilian Pantanal, Peruvian Amazonia and Bolivian Chaco (Navarro 1985, Emmons 1988, Crawshaw and Quigley 1989, Laack 1991, Maffei and Noss 2008).","At present the major threats for the species are habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry and illegal trade of pets and pelts (Sunquist and Sunquiest 2002).The Ocelot has been described as being tolerant in some degree to habitat disturbs and persists in wooded patches near human settlements. However, Ocelot abundance is negatively affected by anthropogenic effects like poaching and logging (Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Although widespread commercial harvests for the fur trade ceased decades ago, some illegal trade still persists.","Ocelot population densities throughout its entire range varies widely from 2.5 to 160/100 km². At a continental scale, Ocelot densities decrease with latitude and increase with rainfall (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Primary productivity seems to determine the abundance of this wild cat across their range, but at a local scale their abundance may be affected by logging and poaching or by competition with other species (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). The lowest densities are found at the Pine Forest of Belize (Dillon and Kelly 2007), dry areas of Mexico (Gonzalez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003) and the Caatinga in northeastern Brazil (Oliveira 2012). The maximum estimated density was found at the Barro Colorado Island in Panamá (Rodgers <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The species is considered Endangered in Mexico (Norma Oficial Mexicana 2010) and in United States (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2010), Vulnerable in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) and Argentina (Aprile <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).

Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey <em>et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014).

Limited drinking water and food appear to keep populations at low density in central Kenya (mean annual rainfall &lt;500 mm), and probably elsewhere. Greatly increased human and livestock populations have led to declines and extirpations in recent decades in central Kenya; competition for water and food has become intense as the region is severely over-stocked with livestock, both outside and inside officially protected areas (De Jong and Butynski 2014, A.

The global population is estimated at more than twice that of all other species of bears combined.&#160;Within the United States, populations have been expanding numerically and geographically.&#160;Legal hunting is the primary cause of mortality and is well controlled by state and provincial management agencies in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.&#160;Hunting is banned in Mexico.&#160;Population-level threats exist in only a few isolated places, and relate mainly to habitat fragmentation and conflicts between bears and people. Many management agencies are more concerned with controlling population growth of this species through legal harvest than promoting further growth and geographic expansion (which could increase human–bear conflicts).</p>","<p>American black bears are primarily a species of temperate and boreal forests, but they also range into subtropical areas of Florida and Mexico as well as into the subarctic. They live at elevations ranging from sea level to 3,500 m, and inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican deserts and scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the grizzly bear; Veitch and Harrington 1996).&#160; Between these extremes they occupy assorted deciduous and coniferous forest types, each providing a different array of foods.<br/> <br/> The American black bear is a generalist, opportunist omnivore. Depending on location and season, they consume herbaceous vegetation, roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion.&#160; Moreover, they readily consume various human-related foods, from garbage and birdseed to a variety of agricultural products from cropfields and orchards, including corn, oats, soybeans, sunflowers, wheat, and apples, and brood and honey in apiaries.&#160; Black bear predation upon livestock has also been documented in some areas. The ability of black bears to adjust their diet to the circumstances has enabled them to persist not only in a diversity of habitat types, but also in highly fragmented forested areas in proximity to humans (Pelton 2003, Benson and Chamberlain 2006, Ditmer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> A key habitat feature in many areas is a source of fall mast that enables black bears to increase their fat reserves for winter hibernation.&#160; Historically, American chestnuts (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) likely were a key fall food for bears (and other wildlife) in eastern North America, but after a blight eliminated this food source in the early and mid-1900s, oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.) acorns and beechnuts (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) have become the principal fall foods for bears throughout this region (Vaughan 2002).&#160; However, oaks are now declining in eastern North America due to forestry practices, insects, disease, and over-abundance of deer (McShea <em>et al. </em>2007), and a disease accidentally introduced in the late 1800s is now spreading widely across beech forests in northeastern U.S. (Morin <em>et al. </em>2007). In parts of the range where oaks and beech are absent or uncommon, hazelnuts (<em>Corylus</em> spp.), whitebark pine nuts (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>), saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) berries, madrone (<em>Arbutus xalapensis</em>), manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos</em> spp.), huckleberries (<em>Vaccinium </em>spp.), buffaloberries (<em>Shepherdia canadensis</em>), wild cherries (<em>Prunus </em>sp.), mountain ash (<em>Sorbus </em>spp.), or other fruits, or sometimes meat, are the fall dietary mainstays.&#160; In the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, succulents such as yucca (<em>Yucca</em> spp.) and cactus fruits also play important roles in providing food, especially during drought (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160; American black bears may migrate considerable distances (up to 200 km) to find more abundant food sources, especially in late summer and fall, prior to hibernation (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Beck 1991, Hellgren <em>et al. </em>2005, Noyce and Garshelis 2011).<br/> <br/> American black bears hibernate for up to 7 months in the northern portions of their range (Bertram and Vivion 2002, Chaulk <em>et al. </em>2005), but for considerably shorter periods in more southerly areas (Wooding and Hardisky 1992, Waller <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; In some southern and low-elevation areas, where food is available year-round, some bears may remain active during winter (Hellgren and Vaughan 1987, Graber 1990, Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Hightower <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; However, all parturient females den to give birth to cubs, typically in January–February.&#160; American black bears use a wide variety of den structures: existing caves or tree cavities, underground chambers that they excavate, root masses, brush piles, or even above-ground nests. Adequate denning sites or structures are rarely thought to be limiting, except in habitats that flood (because young cubs may drown or die of exposure; White <em>et al.</em> 2001), or where bears preferentially choose certain types of dens, such as hollow trees, that are being reduced through logging (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Mating typically occurs in May–July, but may be extended in southern latitudes (Garshelis and Hellgren 1994, Spady <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Females can have as many as 3 estrous cycles (B. Durrant, personal communication, 2014). Implantation is delayed, and active gestation is only 2 months.&#160; Females give birth beginning at age 3–10 years: their rate of growth and maturity varies with food availability, and hence tends to be especially delayed in northern boreal forests.&#160; They can produce cubs every other year, but in places with less food, this interval may be extended to 3 years.&#160; Average litter size is approximately 2.5 cubs in eastern (ranging up to 5 or rarely 6 cubs) versus &lt;2.0 cubs in western North America (Alt 1989, Garshelis 1994, Bridges <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160; Reproductive rate in this species is highest among the ursids, although there is a clear dichotomy between Eastern (including Midwestern) and Western populations.</p>","<p>Throughout most of its range, this species is not threatened.&#160;Legal sport hunting is well controlled by state and provincial agencies to fit management objectives, and most states and provinces that harvest bears have a management plan (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;American black bears are harvested as a game species in all 12 Canadian provinces and territories where they exist and in 31 U.S. states.&#160;Since the early 2000s, 6 states with increasing bear populations opened bear hunting seasons ― Florida, New Jersey and Maryland, after 21-, 33- and 51-year closures, respectively, and Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Nevada for the first time in their management history. The sport harvest for this species in Canada and the U.S. totals 40,000–50,000 annually.&#160;Currently, black bears are not legally hunted in Mexico, but some conditional permits are allowed for depredation cases.<br/> <br/> A few small, isolated populations of American black bears may be threatened with extirpation, simply due to small population size, effects of fluctuating food (and in some cases water) resources, or direct human-caused mortality.&#160;A very small (&lt;20 black bears), isolated population in western Florida may persist only if tenuous travel corridors to other, more robust populations are made safer for bears (Larkin <em>et al. </em>2004). An isolated population on a peninsula in Ontario was judged to have a high probability of extirpation unless all non-natural mortality was eliminated (Howe <em>et al. </em>2007). A black bear population on a large island in Québec was extirpated apparently from introduced deer excessively browsing berry-producing shrubs, and thus eliminating an essential food supply for the resident bears (Côté 2005).<br/> <br/> Most small, isolated populations are in the southern U.S. In a particularly dramatic case, a severe drought in 2000 prompted a number of bears from Big Bend National Park, an isolated population in southwestern Texas, to travel to Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, apparently in search of better fall mast — most never returned (they either remained in Mexico, died naturally when crossing the desert, or were killed by people).&#160;As a result, the entire Big Bend population was reduced to 5–7 bears, including only 2 adult females (Hellgren et al. 2005).&#160;However, since that time, this population has rebounded to higher numbers than were there before the exodus in 2000, likely supplemented by bears immigrating from Mexico. Mexico served as the original source of the recolonization of bears in southwest Texas after they had been eradicated during the 1940s (Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Movements by bears across the seemingly harsh, xeric environment of southwestern U.S. and Mexico once appeared to be anomalous (Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Onorato <em>et al. </em>2004), but it is now recognized as an integral part of the ecology of bears in this region.&#160; In 2011, northern Mexico experienced record drought and wildfires that not only caused high direct bear mortality, but also prompted immigration of bears of both sexes into unburned, previously unoccupied habitat in both Mexico and Texas.<br/> <br/> Increased public awareness of bears and protection from human-caused mortality are likely enabling bears to successfully traverse areas of Mexico where they once would have been persecuted.&#160; Additionally, reports of bears using deer feeders on game ranches in northern Mexico and south Texas have become commonplace, and may be playing a role in promoting bear movements and population growth.&#160; Conversely, recently constructed barriers and human activity spurred by illegal human immigration and drug-related violence could thwart the natural interchange of bears across the U.S.–Mexican border (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/> <br/> Conflicts with humans have been a threat to black bears since European colonization of North America (Cardoza 1976). Human–bear conflict stems from humans and bears competing for space and bears being attracted to food items produced or managed by people. Due to their generalist food habits, black bears are readily attracted to many human sources of foods, such as garbage, agricultural crops, apiaries, and sometimes livestock, especially when their preferred wild foods are scarce. People kill bears in retribution, to prevent property damage, or in fear for their safety.&#160; Encounters between black bears and people have increased as people have encroached upon bear habitat, and as bear populations have increased and expanded into areas occupied by people.&#160; Most states and provinces with a significant population of black bears report common or increasing conflicts between bears and people (Hristienko and McDonald 2007, Spencer <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Recent studies suggest that variation in abundance of natural foods tends to be a key driver of human–bear conflict levels (Howe <em>et al. </em>2010, Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urban areas provide attractive sources of anthropogenic food for bears during periods of natural food shortages, but also are a source of increased mortality (Ryan <em>et al. </em>2007, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014). Urban areas are expected to increase across American black bear range in the future (Bierwagen <em>et al. </em>2010), which, coupled with the potential frequent natural food shortages in arid bear habitats as a result of global climate change, may threaten small or isolated bear populations.<br/> <br/> Increasing density of roads, with increasing traffic volume, is another growing threat to American black bears.&#160; Without immigration from an adjacent national forest, bear numbers in a rural residential community in north-central Florida would have declined as a result of increased adult female mortality from vehicle collisions (Hostetler <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; A stretch of highway in North Carolina that was upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane, with increased speed limits and a new alignment, caused increased bear mortalities that negatively affected the nearby population, even though underpasses were made available (van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012). Poor food years tend to spur wide-scale movements of black bears, resulting in increased mortalities from vehicular collisions (Wooding and Maddrey 1994).</p>","<p>Heavily persecuted since European settlement of North America, compounded by loss of forest cover, American black bear populations rapidly declined, and probably reached a nadir in the early 1900s. Greater state and provincial protection for bears enabled populations to slowly recover.&#160; More rapid growth occurred with increasing protective measures since the late 1980s (Williamson 2002).&#160; By 1999, 60% of U.S. and Canadian states and provinces reported increasing populations, and other jurisdictions appeared to be either stable or fluctuating with no clear trend (Garshelis and Hristienko 2006).&#160; Many of these trend assessments, though, were not derived from serial estimates of population size.<br/> <br/> Based on sums of estimates for individual states, the total U.S. population, excluding Alaska, is estimated at somewhat greater than 300,000.&#160; No reliable estimate exists for numbers of black bears in Alaska, although authorities presume there to be 100,000–200,000 animals.&#160; Similarly, large populations in most parts of Canada are not reliably known, but countrywide estimates center around 450,000 (principally in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec).&#160;Thus, the total number of black bears in North America is likely within the range 850,000–950,000.&#160; No population estimates exist for the country of Mexico, although some areas within Mexico have high and increasing black bear densities (SEMARNAP 1999, Doan-Crider 2003).<br/> <br/> Many population size or density estimates have been derived using rigorous mark–recapture approaches.&#160;Densities have been reported as high as 155 independent black bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (on an Alaskan island with legal hunting and abundant natural foods; Peacock <em>et al. </em>2011) and 214 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (coastal North Carolina with abundant agricultural crops consumed by bears; van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012) to as low as 5 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (interior Alaska; Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997; and pine forest with little food or cover in coastal South Carolina; Drewry <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Some mark–recapture population estimates have been conducted over large geographic areas, encompassing whole states or provinces or numerous study sites across the state or province (e.g., Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ontario: Garshelis and Visser 1997, Garshelis and Noyce 2006, Dreher <em>et al.</em> 2007, Belant <em>et al. </em>2011, Howe <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lackey <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Population trend information is also commonly derived from mark–recapture or from population reconstruction or modelling using ages of legally-harvested bears (Fieberg et al. 2010).&#160; Population size and trend information are routinely used by management agencies to regulate harvest pressure and inform trends in human–bear conflicts.&#160; Detailed demographic studies have revealed that survival and recruitment of American black bears is closely tied to year-to-year variation in natural food abundance (Costello <em>et al. </em>2003, Reynolds-Hogland <em>et al. </em>2007, Obbard and Howe 2008, McCall <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Once portrayed as having one of the lowest rates of reproduction of any land mammal in North America, American black bears in some parts of the range, especially in the East and Midwest, are now known to have higher reproductive rates than previously reported (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160; With controls on human-caused mortality, populations can increase rapidly, and spread through immigration. A black bear population in interior Alaska that was almost entirely removed to reduce predation on moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) completely recovered in 4–6 years by immigration (of both sexes) from the surrounding landscape (Keech <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>",Increasing,"<p>American black bears range across three countries: 12 provinces and territories of Canada (all except Prince Edward Island, where they were once abundant, but the last known one shot in 1927; Sobey 2007); 41 U.S. states (with sightings but undefined ranges in 5 other states); and 6 states of northern Mexico (Scheick and McCown 2014) (with sightings in 4 other Mexican states and a recent record of a dead bear farther south in the state of Hidalgo; Rojas-Martínez and Juárez-Casillas 2013). The species never existed outside of these three countries, although the southern historic limit is not well known. The present range falls within 69°29´ to 23°14´ N (with the incidental record in Hidalgo at 21°05’30” N) and 52°49´ to 164°10´W.<br/> <br/> In western parts of their range, American black bears broadly overlap and compete with grizzly/brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) (Mattson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013). Black bears occupy several islands off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia, but do not coexist with brown bears on any islands.&#160; Northward, black bears narrowly overlap with polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) along the Québec coast of Ungava peninsula, the Ontario and Québec coasts of James Bay, and along the Ontario and Manitoba coasts of Hudson Bay.&#160; Climate change seems to have enabled black bears to range farther north. For example, there have been recent sightings of black bears near Salluit, the second northernmost Inuit community in Québec (62°12'N) (S. Côté, Laval University, Québec City, personal communication, 2015).&#160; Along the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut, local hunters from the community of Arviat (61°5'N) have observed black bears about 50 km west of the village.&#160; These sightings have occurred since 2005, were of single individuals, and are considered to be rare (D. Lee, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, personal communication, 2014) but are farther north than similarly rare excursions noted by Jonkel and Miller (1970).<br/> <br/> Loss of habitat and unregulated hunting/persecution resulted in extirpation of black bears across large portions of their range by the early 1900s.&#160; Present occupied range covers 10.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, representing 65–75% of the historical range, depending on whether Midwestern prairies are counted as historical range (Scheick and McCown 2014). &#160;Black bears were documented along some wooded river courses through the Great Plains (e.g., Lewis and Clark expedition, 1804–1806; Laliberte and Ripple 2003), but were likely scarce in the grasslands. More of the original distribution remains in Canada (&gt;95%; 6.9 million km<sup>2</sup>) than the U.S. (45–60%; 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup>). However, recolonization from growing neighboring populations, in some cases assisted by translocations, have occurred across the U.S., including several previously extirpated states: Rhode Island and Connecticut in the Northeast (Cardoza 1976, Scheick and McCown 2014), Kentucky in the Southeast (Unger <em>et al</em>. 2013), Ohio, Oklahoma and Missouri in the Midwest (Bales <em>et al</em>. 2005, Scheick and McCown 2014, Wilton <em>et al</em>. 2014; although genetic studies suggest that Missouri bears may not have been completely extirpated ― Faries et al. 2013, Puckett <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Texas (Onorato and Hellgren 2001) and Nevada in the Southwest (including areas that were erroneously thought to be outside historic range; Lackey<em> et al</em>. 2013). The current distribution in Mexico (at least 99,000 km<sup>2</sup>) is believed to have been drastically reduced from an unknown historical extent due to deforestation, hunting, and incidental killing from predator poisoning (Delfín-Alfonso <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, these bears are also now expanding and reoccupying portions of their former range, and possibly new areas because of artificial water and food sources.</p>","<p>A looming concern, but not a widespread problem in North America, is the poaching of bears for their paws and gall bladders, which may be sold commercially. Those products, particularly bile from gall bladders, are highly valued by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine.&#160; Several U.S. states and Canadian provinces allow the sale of bear parts taken legally by hunters, either within that jurisdiction or transported into that jurisdiction from elsewhere (Williamson 2002). An argument can be made that this creates opportunities for poachers to employ an illicit pathway into the legal, commercial trade. However, illegal trade appears to be very limited.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>n the U.S. and Canada, black bears are managed by individual states and provinces, so although an IUCN conservation action plan exists for this species (Pelton et al. 1999), each state and province sets their own goals and methods for achieving those goals.&#160; As a whole, this has worked well to re-establish robust populations of black bears across their range. Several key factors aided the rapid rebound of American black bears since the 1980s: (1) improved habitat, (2) large dispersal distances in high-quality habitat (Moore et al. 2014), (3) relatively high reproductive rates, (4) reduced human-caused mortality, and (5) better information about the biology and ecology of bears combined with better population monitoring techniques (Miller 1990).<br/> <br/> Much forested habitat, essential for black bears, was cleared indiscriminately for agriculture during the 1700s–mid-1900s, but has since returned in many parts of the U.S. Most notably, northeastern U.S. (New England) has been naturally reforested back to near its pre-colonial extent (~400 years ago; Hall <em>et al. </em>2002), although tree composition is different (fewer hard mast-producing trees as food for bears; Thompson <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Some states and provinces also manage habitat to benefit bears (e.g., space, foods, travelways, den sites; Pelton <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/> <br/> Through the 1800s and early 1900s in some areas, black bears were extensively hunted for meat, skins, and grease (i.e., market hunting; Smith <em>et al. </em>1991, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013) or hunted or poisoned with the intent of eliminating or severely reducing their numbers to reduce damage to crops and livestock (Cardoza 1976, Raybourne 1987).&#160; Governments often paid a bounty to encourage the killing of black bears.&#160; Protection and recovery occurred state-by-state and province-by-province during 1902–1983 as laws were changed and bears gained protection as a big game species (Miller 1990).&#160;Thereafter, the number and sex of bears killed were more closely controlled through hunting regulations and restrictions on numbers of hunters.&#160; By the 1980s, under the belief that black bears reproduced slowly and were easily over-harvested, most management agencies took a conservative approach to black bear hunting to enable populations to increase (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;Moreover, an infrastructure of wildlife management agency personnel and hunters policed illegal take.<br/> <br/> Wildlife management agencies have also taken an increasingly active role in reducing the number of bears killed in conflict situations through stricter laws against shooting and feeding (in some jurisdictions, feeding bears is illegal), and educational programs aimed at coexisting with bears by reducing attractants, promoting public tolerance, and recognizing that black bears are typically not a threat to human safety (Treves <em>et al. </em>2009, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> In Mexico all hunting seasons for American black bears have been closed since 1985, and the species is considered nationally endangered.&#160;Numerous conservation initiatives established by large private ranches and land cooperatives in northern Mexico have created large blocks of suitable habitat (e.g., oak-dominated forests) with protection from poaching (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160;Changing public attitudes toward bears in Mexico have also contributed to the recovery and expansion of the species (SEMARNAP 1999, Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Although bear populations are clearly increasing, population estimation and monitoring efforts are lacking because funding (normally associated with hunting fees in the U.S. and Canada) is not available.&#160;Hunting bans will likely not be lifted without better documentation of population size and trend.<br/> <br/> In the southeastern U.S., where black bears now occupy 27–37% of their historic range (depending on whether primary range or total bear range are counted as occupied range; Scheick and McCown 2014), population recovery was aided by the establishment of national parks and other sanctuaries in the Appalachian Mountains and the Coastal Plain (Pelton and van Manen 1997).&#160;These large areas protect the habitat (especially mast-producing trees) and restrict hunter access.&#160;Beginning in the early 1970s, additional areas were established where bear hunting was prohibited, thus linking protected areas to other forested lands, including many private lands.&#160;the resulting conglomerates serve as dedicated or defacto sanctuaries, especially for adult females, that are a source for bears expanding into other areas (Beringer <em>et al. </em>1998, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> In some areas, populations of American black bears have either been augmented or reintroduced after former extirpation by transplanting bears from elsewhere (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; Reintroductions into Arkansas during the 1960s were highly successful (Smith <em>et al. </em>1991).&#160; Licensed hunters in this state now harvest several hundred bears annually, and bears from Arkansas have expanded into neighboring states. Further reintroductions within Arkansas have been conducted more recently (Wear <em>et al. </em>2005). A successful reintroduction augmented a newly-spawning population in Kentucky (Unger <em>et al. </em>2013). Augmentation of several populations in Louisiana during the mid-1960s likely contributed to population recovery there.<br/> <br/> The Louisiana black bear (<em>U. a. luteolus</em>), a recognized subspecies of American black bear, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1992 as a result of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality (Bowker and Jacobson 1995).&#160;At the time of the listing, and since then, the validity and integrity of this subspecies has been debated (Pelton 1991, Kennedy <em>et al</em>. 2002, Csiki <em>et al. </em>2003, Puckett <em>et al. </em>2015). Under this ruling, all bears within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear, from east Texas to southern Mississippi, have been protected.&#160;Much of the bottomland hardwood forest that the Louisiana black bear historically inhabited had been converted to agriculture.&#160;Since 1992, remnant bottomland hardwoods have been protected, and some marginal farmland converted to hardwood trees.&#160; Moreover, a new population of bears within Louisiana was established by translocating bears from other Louisiana populations (Benson and Chamberlain 2007) in order to create a stepping-stone between two separated populations; this enabled bears to travel between them (Laufenberg and Clark 2014).&#160;One irony is that the stepping-stone successfully linked a population that was believed to be native Louisiana black bears with a population that had previously been established by translocating <em>U. a. americanus</em> bears from Minnesota (1964–1967). The Minnesota bears had clearly adapted to the very different habitat and weather conditions in Louisiana, as they have been established there for three generations and their numbers have been increasing.&#160;However, if the <em>luteolus</em> subspecies has any merit, the successful establishment of a conservation corridor reduced the purity of that genetic stock.<br/> <br/> The conservation efforts in Louisiana have been further enhanced through public information and education.&#160;This management program is organized by a broad coalition of state and federal agencies, conservation groups, forestry and agricultural industries, and private landowners.&#160;As a result, bears have been noticeably increasing in numbers and distribution in all three range states, although a breeding population does not yet exist in east Texas.&#160; Large, contiguous forested habitat capable of sustaining a population of black bears exists within the historical range of the subspecies in east Texas (Kaminski <em>et al. </em>2013); however, surveys of local people indicate concern over potential conflicts with an established bear population in the area (Morzillo <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the Louisiana black bear, based largely on a rigorous study (Laufenberg and Clark 2014) that showed that all of the population criteria for recovery had been attained and adequate safeguards against future threats were in place (Fuller 2015).<br/> <br/> Another typically-accepted subspecies of black bear (<em>U. a. floridanus</em>) was listed as threatened by the state of Florida in 1974, although legal hunting continued in some population strongholds until 1994.&#160;Habitat degradation, and bears being killed on highways and in conflicts with people are the primary threats to these bears. The fragmented habitat contributes to the high vehicle kills and human interactions. A public petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the Florida black bear as a federally threatened species was denied in 1992.&#160;A black bear management plan, adopted in 1993, directed the state management agency to conserve habitat and reduce human-caused bear mortalities. These efforts, particularly habitat conservation measures and changes in human attitudes toward bears, supported a steady population increase (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;Florida black bears have been expanding into areas of unoccupied habitat as regrowth of understory and forests improve habitat quality, even as development reduces habitat quantity.&#160; In 2010 the status of the Florida black bear was re-evaluated using IUCN redlisting criteria, and after a thorough, peer-reviewed biological assessment and development of a management plan, the species was removed from the state’s threatened species list in 2012 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;A hunt was initiated in 2015.<br/> <br/> In British Columbia much conservation attention has been directed toward the Kermode subspecies <em>(U. a. kermodei</em>).&#160;This animal is commonly referred to as the “spirit bear” because it possesses a gene that when homozygous is manifested as white pelage (Ritland <em>et al. 2</em>001).&#160; White-phased animals have long been protected from hunting.&#160; A large system of protected areas was established in 2006 (Great Bear Rainforest Agreement) to ban or severely restrict logging within &gt;200,000 ha of coastal temperate rainforest inhabited by this subspecies of black bear, as well as by brown bears.&#160; Additionally, the spirit bear was selected as the official provincial mammal of British Columbia.<br/> <br/> Since 1992 all American black bears have been listed in Appendix II of CITES, under the similarity of appearance provision (Article II, para 2b).&#160; This listing stipulates that documentation of legal harvest is necessary for the import and export of body parts in order to prevent these from being confused as parts from illegally obtained bears.&#160; This listing was not designed to protect American black bears, but rather other species of threatened bears, particularly the Asiatic black bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), whose parts might otherwise be sold under the guise of being from American black bear.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

115130419,15951,Panthera leo,Vulnerable,A2abcd,2016,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>  </p>The Lion population is inferred to have undergone a reduction of approximately 43% over the past 21 years (approximately three Lion generations, 1993-2014).<br/><br/>We infer a decline of 43% based on time trend analysis of census data for 47 relatively well monitored Lion subpopulations. These subpopulations approximately totalled an estimated 7,500 Lions in 2014 and comprise a substantial portion of the total species population, so that we feel confident in applying observed trends to the species as a whole as well as on a regional basis.<br/><br/>The overall classification of the Lion as Vulnerable masks a dichotomy: we observe that sample Lion subpopulations increased by 12% in four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in India, while an observed decline of 60% in sample subpopulations outside these countries is inferred for the remainder of its African range. In other words, in the majority of its range the Lion meets the A2 criterion for Endangered with the inferred rate of decline over 50% in three generations, but this trend is numerically mitigated by a small number of subpopulations in a restricted geographical range.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is reflected in listings of the species in different Red Lists: in South Africa, the Lion will be categorized as Least Concern on the national Red List in preparation (Child <em>et al</em>. In prep.), whereas in India it is Endangered (as subspecies <em>P. l. persica</em> on the global IUCN Red List: Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2008) and in the region of West Africa meets the criteria for Critically Endangered (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015).&#160; The range state list in Table 1 (attached Supporting Material) further illustrates the high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, as Lions have been recently extirpated in 12 African countries and we suspect possible recent extirpation in another four.<br/><br/>Among the causes of decline, the most important are indiscriminate killing in defence of human life and livestock, habitat loss, and prey base depletion. Prey base depletion is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al</em>. 2013). An emerging threat is trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (IUCN 2006a, b; Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, although trophy hunting contributes positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices have been recommended (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2013, Edwards<em> et al</em>. 2014), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Croes <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). While attention is currently focused on Lion hunting reforms to ensure sustainability, the leading causes of population decline are more difficult to address and are likely to continue. The observed and inferred reductions are based on direct observation; appropriate indices of abundance; declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality; and actual and potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in southern Africa. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is properly funded; fencing is one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets are low, leading to local decline and even extinction, for example in West Africa (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160; Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic and South Sudan, but we fear drastic declines especially for the latter two.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we assess the Lion as Vulnerable based on criterion A, more specifically A2abcd. Lion range and abundance exceed the Vulnerable thresholds for criteria B, C and D, respectively, so these criteria do not contribute to the present assessment, whilst criterion E was not applied. Vulnerable A2abcd is the same listing as the previous assessment but with a different underlying method. Previous assessments were based on a suspected decline of the total estimated number of Lions, which necessarily included low quality data. In the present assessment we did not use total Lion estimates, because we had a better alternative. We now have enough good quality data for a representative sub-set of Lion subpopulations to calculate an observed decline, from which we infer a decline for the species as a whole.<br/><p>  </p>","The Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer 2013). Although Lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but Lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills.<br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting. Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266-4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001).<br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic Lion is dry deciduous forest. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al</em>. 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic Lion's diet, although the most common prey is the Chital Deer. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","<p>The main threats to Lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock) and prey base depletion. Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hazzah <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol <em>et al</em>. 1985, Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Loveridge <em>et al</em>. 2007, Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunter<em> et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>Disease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Trinkel <em>et al</em>. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).<br/></p>","<p><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>This assessment is based on a time trend analysis of census data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013, plus additional unpublished data provided by contributors). Census estimates were obtained by scientific research methods including total count, individual identifications, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photo databases, spoor counts and density estimates based on direct observations corrected for patrol effort.&#160;These methods are rated as producing the most reliable type of Lion population estimates by background papers for the 2006 IUCN regional Lion workshops (Table 5 in Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b).&#160;We did not include population estimates for sites which were based on extrapolation of Lion densities obtained by research in other areas, or informed guesstimates by researchers. The minimum number of census surveys per site over the assessment time period is two, but some sites have been more regularly monitored (Table 3 - Data Points column, in Supplementary Material).&#160;In some cases census methodology varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em>et al</em>. (2013):</p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR</p><p>Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; R<sub>span</sub> = 15.5 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 12 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013)</p><p>Thus GL = 12*0.29 +3.5 = 6.98 yrs<br/><br/>To fill gaps between censuses conducted in non-consecutive years, we interpolated population sizes, assuming a linear change between years. For surveys conducted for only a few years between 1993 and 2014, we extrapolated to the beginning and end points based on an exponential rate of change taken from the observed growth rate for each respective subpopulation. However, all extrapolations are capped by the estimated carrying capacity for each reserve so that subpopulations that experienced dramatic population change were not assumed to have been at implausibly high totals in either 1993 or 2014. Subpopulations were first categorized according to whether or not the reserves were surrounded by a fence; unfenced subpopulations were further categorized according to geographical location with the exception of Niassa Reserve (Mozambique), treated as an outlier as discussed below.<br/><br/>In graph form (Figures 1-4 in the Supplementary Material) we summarize the repeated censuses of 46 different African Lion subpopulations using all available repeat-survey data. Figure 5 (in the Supplementary Material) addresses the 47th Lion subpopulation in our analysis, the only Asian subpopulation.<br/><br/>Outside parts of southern Africa, Lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62% between 1993 and 2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).&#160; Although these totals only included about 4,600 Lions in the year 1993, several surveyed areas are restricted to the best-protected portions of much larger ecosystems (e.g., the phototourism areas of Selous and Serengeti).<br/><br/>In contrast, the total number of Lions in six unfenced reserves in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe only declined by about 11% (Figure 2, Supplementary Material). Note that the overall stability in southern Africa masks considerable heterogeneity: between 1993 and 2014 the monitored Lion subpopulation in a portion of the Okavango ecosystem is estimated to have declined by 46%, whereas the much smaller subpopulations in Gonarezhou and Kunene have increased dramatically.<br/><br/>The striking contrast between these three countries in southern Africa and the rest of the continent is probably related to the equally striking differences in human population densities (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013) in Namibia (2.5/km²), Botswana (3.4) and Zimbabwe (26) vs. Benin (78), Burkina Faso (57), Cameroon (40), Cote d’Ivoire (64), Ghana (102), Kenya (67), Nigeria (189), Rwanda (420), Senegal (68), Tanzania (48), Uganda (137) and Zambia (45).<br/><br/>The unfenced Niassa subpopulation is estimated to have increased by over 250% since 1993 (Figure 3, Supplementary Material); despite severe bushmeat poaching the Lions are still recovering from excessive prey depletion during civil war. In addition, on a shorter time scale, Lions have benefited from extensive ivory poaching, which has provided them with sizeable quantities of elephant meat (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2014). Human population density in Mozambique is 74/km² with sizeable numbers of people living inside Niassa Reserve, so unless management is further strengthened, this unfenced Lion subpopulation may soon experience declining food supplies and increased human-lion conflicts. These arguments strongly suggest that the ‘boom’ in the Niassa Lion subpopulation has stopped and is unlikely to be repeated in the future. We therefore consider Niassa to be a special case and treat it as an outlier in our analyses, we believe that this offers a better understanding of trends, but we note that this does not alter the assessment (with Niassa included, the assessment would still be Vulnerable A2abcd).<br/><br/>The 16 fenced African subpopulations (10 in South Africa, and all but one in southern Africa) have grown by 29% since 1993, most having already reached their presumed carrying capacities by 2013 (Figure 4, Supplementary Material). Note that although these numbers now total over 3,226 lions, our data come from the great majority of fenced reserves in Africa and that little further growth can be expected in these subpopulations.<br/><br/>Asia is home to a single contiguous subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat (Figure 5, Supplementary Material). While the population has stabilized inside the Gir Reserve, the so-called “satellite” population in the surrounding countryside has expanded by ~400% in the past 21 years.<br/><br/>The 47 sample Lion subpopulations totalled an estimated 9,615 lions in 1993 (excluding Niassa, which is treated as an outlier as described above); that number shrank by 22% to 7,455 lions in 2014 (Table 2, Supplementary Material).&#160; However, as described above, there are significant regional differences evident in population trend, and we use these to inform our inferences about population trend for the species as a whole. Table 2 (Supplementary Material) groups the sample subpopulations by region in Africa, following the IUCN (2006a, b) regional Lion conservation strategies, but combining West and Central Africa due to a small sample size for Central Africa.&#160; In Southern Africa, the sample population grew by 8%, while in sharp contrast, sample populations declined by 59% in Eastern Africa and 66% in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Table 3 (Supplementary Material) shows the estimated Lion population size in 1993 and 2014 for each of the 47 sample subpopulations with percentage change, and it can be seen that most countries had a declining trend for sample Lion subpopulations, with only four countries (India, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) seeing a growth trend. Table 4 (Supplementary Material) groups these countries with Botswana, which had a relatively low average rate of decline for its sample populations; two out of three sample subpopulations increased; the decline documented in the Okavango subpopulation was restricted to only part of the protected area; and overall 2012 estimates for the national population suggest that it his increased since 2003 (C. Winterbach unpubl. data). Mozambique is not included in this group as the increasing trend in its Niassa subpopulation is treated as an outlier in this analysis. The sample Lion population in five countries (Botswana, India, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) grew by an estimated 12%, whereas the Lion population in the remaining African range countries declined by an estimated 61% (Table 4, Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We infer population trend for the total Lion species population based on these two rates of change, as follows. In 2002, two separate country compilations of population estimates for Lions in Africa estimated the number of Lions in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to comprise between 1/4 to 1/3 of the total African Lion population, as shown in Table 5 (Supplementary Material). We suspect that this proportion was somewhat lower in 1993, given that the number of Lions is inferred to have increased in these countries while decreasing in the remainder, and use a figure of 1/4 or 25% for our species population trend calculation. If 25% of the Lion population increased by 12%, and 75% decreased by 60%, this results in an inferred trend of (0.75*-60%) + (0.25*12%) = -43% between 1993 and 2014 (Table 6, Supplementary Material).</p><br/>This qualifies the Lion as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that the vast majority of the population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the criteria for Endangered. Since our sample subpopulations were all monitored, we suspect an even greater average rate of decline for unmonitored unfenced subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort.<br/><br/><strong>Abundance</strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers, we present no new data. A recent paper summarized and updated efforts to estimate the population size of the African Lion leading to the most recent estimate of 32,000 lions in 67 Lion areas (Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). The paper presents some recent data, but where no new data were available it included unaltered numbers from earlier sources, such as Bauer and Van der Merwe (2004) and Chardonnet (2002). As a consequence, Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) include numbers from 2002 and 2004 for areas where we believe the downward trend described above occurred. We therefore consider these sources to be insufficiently precautionary for our purpose and feel that an assessment on numbers is less robust than our assessment based on trends. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative (see above), we decided not to use total Lion numbers for the present assessment<br/><br/>However, we do attempt to correct for outdated sources in the Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimate by application of the regional trends we found (Table 3, Supplementary Material) to the 2002 population size estimates within the respective regions (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004, Chardonnet 2002). These are two largely independent and reasonably comprehensive sets of estimated numbers that were coherent in time. Rather than presenting these numbers as in any way current, we look at how they might be expected to have changed.&#160;We calculated estimated present Lion numbers per region (Table 7, Supplementary Material) by applying the observed trend over the subsequent 12 years, except that numbers for West Africa were taken from a comprehensive recent survey (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014) because of their greater precision. As a small modification from Chardonnet (2002) we moved the estimate for Selous ecosystem to Eastern Africa to be consistent with the regional divisions used here. The two 2002 estimates were compared in detail (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2005a,b), showing the ALWG study (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004) was more conservative and stricter on data quality. Most notably, Bauer and Van Der Merwe (2004) lacked data for Ruaha and Tarangire which may hold close to 5,000 Lions. With all these considerations, we have greater confidence in an estimate of closer to 20,000 Lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000.<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty&#160;</strong>We do not have sufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates to employ them to estimate trend and for this assessment have used groupings of scientific time series site estimates as a proxy. &#160;Although these data are more numerous for Lions than for other big <em>Panthera </em>cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2015) and our treatment of it to estimate species population trend. Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2014) state that, ""All attitudes (towards uncertainty) should be explicitly documented. &#160;In situations where the spread of plausible values (after excluding extreme or unlikely values) qualifies a taxon for two or more categories of threat, the precautionary approach would recommend that the taxon be listed under the higher (more threatened) category.""&#160;<br/>As noted in Table 2 (see Supplementary Material), if the species trend is inferred directly from the total sample population trend, the result, a decline of 22%, would qualify the species as Near Threatened rather than Vulnerable. However, considering the demonstrated significant regional differences such an approach would be inappropriate.&#160;<br/>We treated Mozambique's Niassa subpopulation trend as an outlier and removed it from our trend analysis for reasons described above, but we also documented the effect of the exclusion. Some contributors proposed a second outlier: Tanzania’s Katavi subpopulation. Katavi has been consistently and repeatedly monitored, but the survey methodology was imprecise (vehicle transects: Caro 2011), this yielded a significant decline rate approaching 100% in a large population of over 1,100 estimated lions in the study site portion of the park in 1993 (Table 3). If Katavi would have been treated as an outlier and excluded from the analysis, inferred rate of decline would be 33%, and the rate of decline for Lions in East Africa would be 37%. Lions are still extant in Katavi (as shown in our map), although well below carrying capacity (Kiffner <em>et al.</em> 2008). Rather than using an arbitrary low value, we used the value documented by surveys (zero); Lions are extant but at a density so low as not to be detected. While the methodology is imprecise, it has proved reliable for carnivore monitoring in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al</em>. 2011). Furthermore, the extent of decline may have been measured with lack of precision, but population decline remains uncontested. Since it is one of only two long-term monitoring programmes in Tanzania (Caro 2011) we decided that it was important to include these data and decided that there was insufficient ground to treat it as an outlier.<br/>Another uncertainty that needs to be documented is our treatment of small fenced reserves in southern Africa. Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where intensive management practices include translocations, stocking, contraception and euthanasia. Such management is atypical, and as pointed out by Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) the Red List Guidelines are ambiguous as to the inclusion or exclusion of fenced areas. Their exclusion from the analysis would raise the inferred Lion decline rate to 49%. Following through on our supposition that unmonitored Lion populations have undergone an even higher rate than our monitored sample, this could potentially have been interpreted as a suspected rate of decline over 50%, qualifying the Lion as Endangered. However, we did not exclude fenced populations from our assessment. Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) state that such decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific. We consider that management of Lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes, aims to retain adaptive potential and follows a meta-population management approach. We further consider that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer<em> et al</em>. 2013). We find this sufficient justification for inclusion of these reserves.<br/>National estimated rates of population change are most meaningful in practice, and these are given in Table 3 in the Supplementary Material. &#160;We did not use national rates to gauge species decline, as the sample sizes are generally small and estimates of national Lion populations imprecise.",Decreasing,"Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from Northern Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lions are found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The last assessment of extant Lion range is provided by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013); they identified 67 Lion areas comprising 3.4 million km², which is 17% of historical range or about 25% of savanna Africa. We took those layers as a starting point, but made a few modifications to reflect the cautionary approach used by the IUCN Red List. Like with population numbers (see Population section), Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) copied old layers in the absence of new information. <em>De facto</em>, this means that large swathes of land are classified as Lion range based on the group exercises led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; they found 86 Lion Conservation Units (LCUs) covering 4.6 million km² or 22% of historical range (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008). Henschel <em>et al</em>. (2010, 2014) found that many of these LCUs in West and Central Africa no longer contained Lions, and the range map was adapted accordingly for this assessment. Similarly, the survey and mapping unit at Panthera conducted further range updates based on new survey results and other properly documented information from other regions. Furthermore, some of the mapped LCUs are located in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on lion persistence (e.g. Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof of the contrary, and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as Possibly Extinct but maintained Protected Areas inside them as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as Possibly Extinct could contain relict Lion subpopulations, and should be prioritized for field surveys aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Areas where we consider Lion populations Possibly Extinct total 1,811,087 km², over half (52%) of the range classified as extant by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013). We estimate extant Lion range, areas where we are reasonably confident that lions persist, based on recent records, at 1,654,375 km², or 8% of historical range. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and&#160; the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> in CITES Appendix I. CITES listing of the Lion is currently undergoing a Periodic Review process to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the present situation, with a final recommendation of the Animals Committee expected at its 28th meeting in 2015. The Animals Committee also noted recent information regarding possible changes in the nomenclature of Lions and requests its nomenclature expert to&#160; review this information (CITES AC27 WG8). <br/><br/>In Africa, Lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way Lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for Lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2006). These regional strategies have been used in many countries to develop Lion Conservation Action Plans. While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em></em>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Although a recent survey has indicated the possibility of a higher total population, up to 4,000, even if this figure is confirmed by further survey work, the number of mature individuals is likely to remain below the threshold of 2,500.","Mountain Nyalas occur at elevations of 1,800-4,300 m but are most abundant from 2,400-3,200 m (Atickem in litt. 2009, Sillero-Zubiri 2013). They frequent montane woodlands and the fringes of montane grasslands (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). Highest densities (up to 21/km²) have been recorded in the montane grasslands of Gaysay, Bale, where there is a combination of browse and grass with woodland cover to retreat to during the day (Hillman and Hillman 1987).<br/><br/>The formerly large continuous blocks of suitable woodland and Afroalpine habitat have now been reduced to a series of habitat islands in a sea of cultivated fields. It seems likely that mountain nyalas have been forced into higher areas by human increase and livestock grazing, and are also found above 3,400 m in heath forest and heathlands and on Afroalpine grasslands&#160;up to 4,300 m (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). In the eastern extreme of its distribution, a relict population was recorded in forests as low as 1,800 m (Bolton 1973).","Threatened by illegal hunting, destruction of montane forest and heathlands, encroachment by cattle, expansion of high-altitude cultivation, roads, and harassment by dogs. Permanent occupation of suitable habitat as a result of increasing human and livestock populations is exerting tremendous pressure on Mountain Nyala habitat throughout the range, with anecdotal evidence suggesting they actively avoid livestock (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). Its restricted range, and fragmented populations, make it highly vulnerable to human activities and stochastic events.","The population was estimated at 7,000-8,000 (and perhaps up to 12,500) in the 1960s (Brown 1969), and at 2,000-4,000 individuals in the 1980s (Hillman 1988). Numbers have declined since then. Mountain Nyalas may be extinct in the eastern and southern extremes of their distribution, but a few may still occur in Asba Tafari and in the border between Bale and Sidamo, south of Kofele. East (1999) calculated the population at 2,650, but subsequent information indicates that this may have been an overestimate. The main population formerly occurred in and around the Gaysay grasslands at the northern end of the Bale Mountains, and its numbers have been monitored since 1983. Numbers here increased to 1,050 by the late 1980s (Hillman 1988) as a result of creation of a national park in the 1970s which provided protection from poaching and excluded cattle grazing. Woldegebriel (1996) estimated the population prior to 1990 at 1,500 to 1,900. Unfortunately, following political unrest after the end of the war in 1991, most Mountain Nyala habitat in northern Bale was encroached by cattle and there was extensive hunting. As a result, the Gaysay population decreased to a fraction of what it was earlier. National Park staff estimated it to be 150 to 260 by 1994 (Woldegebriel 1996). There has been some  recovery since, and the Gaysay population was estimated at 550 by Refera and Bekele (2004) and Malcolm and Evangelista (2005).<br/><br/>In addition to Gaysay, there may be 80 to 120 mountain nyalas in other parts of Bale Mountains National Park, less than 100 in adjacent hunting areas to the north of the National Park, and 30 to 60 in Somkaro in west Bale (C. Sillero-Zubiri pers. obs). Malcolm and Evangelista (2005) estimated as many as 500 Mountain Nyala may occur in hunting blocks east of Bale. This would give a total population estimate for the Bale massif of 1,000-1,400. Small fragmented populations found in Arsi (Galama, Chilalo, Kaka and Munesa), and elsewhere (Kuni Muktar, Din Din, Arba Gugu) would total around 600 (Malcolm and Evangelista 2005). Therefore, it is likely that only 1,500 to 2,000 Mountain Nyalas survive throughout the range. A recent survey has indicated the total population may be higher, perhaps up to 4,000 (2,800 mature individuals) (Evangelista <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/>    <p>Recent research has shown that the largest population currently occurs outside Bale National Park on the eastern escarpment of the Bale massif, mainly in Besemena Odobullu and Shedom Berbere (Anagaw Atickem in litt. 2009). </p>",Decreasing,"The Mountain Nyala is endemic to the highlands of Ethiopia, south-east of the Rift Valley, between 6°N and 10°N. Formerly it occurred from Gara Muleta in the east to Shashamane and north Sidamo in the south, but has been eliminated from a large part of its former range. Currently, the main area of its distribution is the Bale Mountains National Park   and the eastern escarpments of the Bale massif. Smaller relict populations occur in Chercher (Amhar) Mountains (Asba Tafari, Arba Guggu, Din Din), Arsi Mountains (Chilalo, Galama, Mt Kaka, Munessa), and West Bale (Somkaro-Korduro ridge) (Hillman 1988, East 1999, Malcolm and Evangelista 2005, Atickem in litt. 2009, Sillero-Zubiri 2013).","Mountain Nyalas are extensively hunted for meat and horns, the latter used for local medicine and to make nipples for traditional milk bottles (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). Trophy hunting blocks in Arsi have been hunted out and hunting concessions have moved to Bale (legal hunting is restricted to adult males); with continued pressure by the industry for additional hunting blocks and larger quotas. Effects of current trophy-hunting programs are not well understood and current trophy hunting quotas may be unsustainable in the long-term (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). On the other hand, sustainable trophy hunting has very high potential for generating the revenue needed to fund effective conservation of this species.",Terrestrial,"Protected by law but enforcement is generally absent. Effective protection is limited to around 20 km² of habitat in Gaysay and around Bale Mountains N.P. headquarters. The Bale Mountains N.P. harbours around half the total population of Mountain Nyalas. The small Kuni-Muktar Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1990 as a second protected area for Mountain Nyala, but by 1996 this sanctuary had suffered severely from poaching, deforestation, cultivation and gully erosion, and the species no longer occurred. The recent (2011) establishment of an additional protected area in the Arsi Mountains may deliver some conservation benefit for the species (Sillero-Zubiri 2013).<br/><br/>The Mountain Nyala, along with the Ethiopian wolf, is a key flagship species for Bale Mountains N.P. and its future will be closely tied to the future of this protected area. It is also very important to spread the risk by establishing effective protection and management of Mountain Nyala populations elsewhere within its range. Sustainable trophy hunting in some of these areas has very high potential for generating the revenue needed to fund effective conservation of this species and the other endemics which share its habitat.&#160;No Mountain Nyalas are currently kept in captivity and it may also be advisable to establish a self-sustaining captive population in collaboration with the Ethiopian conservation authorities, as an insurance against future adversity for the wild population.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Population trends are varied in protected areas, increasing on private land and decreasing elsewhere (20%). It therefore does not currently meet the criteria for threatened status or for Near Threatened. The Common Eland’s Red List status will not change as long as substantial, stable populations continue to occur in a good number of protected areas and it remains a popular and economically significant species on private land. The requirement for large areas to accommodate its seasonal wanderings is likely to result in further contraction of the distribution and numbers of free-ranging populations as human settlement expands. This may be at least partly compensated for by the continued growth of its numbers on private farms and conservancies.","Common Elands are one of the most adaptable ruminants, inhabiting sub-desert, acacia savannah, miombo woodland, and alpine moorlands to 4,900 m (Grimshaw <em>et al. </em>1995, Thouless 2013). They are not found in deep forest, in true deserts, or in completely open grassland, though they do occur in grassland with good herb cover (Thouless 2013). Common Eland are primarily browsers, and move long distances in search of ephemeral food sources.","Habitat loss (due to expanding human settlements) and poaching for its superior meat have resulted in considerable reductions of range and populations. The Common Eland's habit of wandering over large areas may affect its future in ways that cannot be fully predicted (Thouless 2013), for example it may make the species more vulnerable to poaching or disease.","East (1999) produced a total population estimate of 136,000 (correcting for under-counting biases in aerial surveys), with stable/increasing national populations now confined to Namibia (where the majority are on private land), Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania. Population trends vary from increasing to decreasing within individual protected areas, and are generally increasing on private land and decreasing in other areas.<br/><br/>Citing various authors, East (1999) indicates that population density estimates obtained by aerial counts in areas where the species is moderately common generally range from about 0.05-0.4/km². Higher density estimates (0.6-1.0/km²) have been obtained in areas such as Omo National Park (N.P.) in Ethiopia and Nyika N.P. in Malawi (Thouless 2013). Ground surveys or total counts of areas where the species is common have produced similar density estimates.",Stable,"Common Eland formerly occurred throughout the savannah woodlands of eastern and southern Africa, extending into high-altitude grasslands and the arid savannahs and scrublands of the Kalahari and Karoo in southern Africa. It has been eliminated from more than half of its former range by the expansion of human populations (and is now extinct in Burundi), and their numbers have decreased dramatically since the 1970s as a result of civil wars and their aftermath in countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, Angola and Mozambique. They have been&#160;reintroduced to areas of southern Africa (particularly South Africa) and&#160;introduced outside of their natural range to southern and central Namibia (East 1999).","The Common Eland is hunted for food, sport, and other purposes. Their meat is highly prized and each animal provides a large quantity of meat, so they are particular targets of illegal hunters. The proportion of animals taken from the wild and from ranches is not known.<br/><br/>Common Eland have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, as well as in Russia and the Ukraine (Thouless 2013). For a number of perceived advantages including: a high yield of nutritious, 'long life', antibacterial milk; there ability to be readily tamed and herded; long life expectancy in captivity; and there ability to survive in arid regions (low water requirements) (Thouless and references therein). However, management practices such as high food supplement costs, confining them at night and herding them during the day are likely to negate their advantages over cattle in many environments (Hillman 1979).",Terrestrial,"About half of this estimated total population occurs in protected areas and 30% on private land (East 1999).

However, there are two subpopulations that need major attention: one in the east of Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), which is disjunct and subjected to habitat modification in its restricted range; and the other in Oruro department (Bolivia), which apparently is not disjunct and is intensely harvested and used to manufacture <em>charangos</em> (traditional music instruments), <em>matracas</em> or <em>maracas</em> (rattles), and handicrafts such as amulets and souvenirs.<br/>Roughly 60% of the Bolivian range corresponds to the range of the high-altitude population previously known as <em>C. nationi</em>. Peredo (1999) reported more than 15 years ago that increasing difficulties in finding “quirquinchos” in the wild had led artisans from the region of Oruro and La Paz to start using <em>C. vellerosus</em> individuals (Tarifa and Romero-Muñoz 2009). Because Municipal Bylaw 31/99 in Oruro did not succeed in reducing the use of <em>Chaetophractus</em> carapaces in traditional dances (Pérez-Zubieta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009), it is probable that the impact of hunting is increasingly affecting both the high-altitude (formerly <em>C. nationi</em>) and southern (<em>C. vellerosus</em>) subpopulations of Bolivia. In addition, illegal trade of specimens from Chile to Bolivia has been reported. This potential threat to the Chilean subpopulation should be closely monitored.<br/><br/>The genetic data published by Abba <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2015) indicate that <em>Chaetophractus</em> specimens from high-altitudes of Bolivia share a unique mitochondrial haplotype, which is also found in a <em>C. vellerosus</em> specimen from Argentina. This absence of genetic diversity observed in the 10 individuals sampled within the Oruro region suggests a local reduction of effective population size (Abba <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). There is therefore no doubt that the synonymized <em>C. vellerosus</em> would have to be listed in a threatened category—either Vulnerable or Endangered—within Bolivia and that conservation measures should be implemented as soon as possible to save the species from regional extinction (Abba <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).","<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>The Screaming Hairy Armadillo <em>Chaetophractus vellerosus</em> is primarily found in xeric environments, in lowland and upland areas as well as high altitude grasslands with loose sandy soils, it also has been recorded from rangeland pasture and agricultural areas. In Buenos Aires province this armadillo lives on sandy-calcareous soils and prefers grasslands with low vegetation and high vegetation cover (Abba <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). This omnivorous animal constructs burrows and therefore is absent from rocky areas where burrows cannot be excavated (Greegor 1985; Abba <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2007, 2011; Abba and Cassini 2008; Pérez Zubieta 2008, 2011). <br/><br/>In Bolivia, Screaming Hairy Armadillos use crop areas while searching for food, while sand dunes are vital for their survival because they use them for burrow construction and foraging (Pérez Zubieta 2011).<br/><br/>The estimated home range size is 3.4 ha in Catamarca, Argentina (Greegor 1980) and 1 to 5.3 ha in Buenos Aires province, Argentina (Glaz and Carlini 1999). Pagnutti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2014) described seasonal differences in home range size in a closed population in Buenos Aires province, Argentina: in fall-winter, home range size was 0.23 ha and 0.27 ha in males and females, respectively, while it was 0.75 and 0.13 ha, respectively, during spring-summer. In this population, the spatial distribution of <em>C. vellerosus </em>was aggregated and possibly influenced by land use (Pagnutti <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Densities of 0.58 animals/km<sup>2</sup> have been observed in Kaa-Iya National Park, Bolivia (Cuéllar 2008). Peredo (1999) estimated a total population of 13,000 individuals in an area of 340 km<sup>2</sup> in Bolivia.<br/><br/>During the cold season, Screaming Hairy Armadillos are mainly active at noon and the early afternoon, while in warm seasons their activity period shifts to the afternoon and night (Greegor 1980, Abba <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). However, their activity seems to be diurnal throughout the year at high altitudes (Zúñiga and Araya 2014). <br/><br/>The diet of <em>C. vellerosus</em> is mainly composed of beetles, butterfly larvae, plant matter and small vertebrates (Greegor 1980, Soibelzon <em>et al</em>. 2007, Abba <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><em>C. vellerosus</em> is a seasonal breeder. Its reproductive season lasts from September to January in Buenos Aires province (Abba <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011) and November to January in Bolivia (Cuéllar 2008). One to two offspring per litter are born inside the burrow after a gestation period of 60 days. Offspring remain inside the burrow during the entire lactation and start emerging in January-February.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Chaetophractus vellerosus</span> is heavily hunted for its meat and carapace (including for <em>charangos</em>, a musical instrument, and <em>matracas</em>; Aguiar and Fonseca 2008, Romero-Muñoz and Pérez-Zubieta 2008), in Bolivia in some parts of the Chaco region (Cuéllar and Noss 2003, Noss <span style=""font-style: italic;""><em>et al.</em></span> 2008). It is also persecuted as an agricultural pest. In addition, some animals are killed by hunting dogs and by cars on roads. The isolated population on the coast of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, is negatively affected by mining activities (Abba 2008, Abba <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><em><br/>C. vellerosus </em>also suffers from habitat loss from sand excavation for concrete production (Peredo 1999) and agricultural activities (Ríos and Rocha 2002).  Animals living at high altitudes of Bolivia (previously considered to be <em>C. nationi</em>) are negatively affected by the intense use to make handicrafts. Cáceres (1995) estimated that 2,000 individuals are harvested each year for this purpose. Illegal trade from Chile to Bolivia as well as within Bolivia has been reported and seems to be related to the reduction of the subpopulation near Oruro and the resulting difficulties to obtain animals for handicraft production. Although the extent of this illegal trade has not been quantified, it is suspected to negatively affect the local population.","The population status of this species is not known, but is expected to be stable. Nonetheless, it is presumed that the high-altitude armadillos in Bolivia, which were formerly classified as <em>C. nationi</em>, are decreasing. <br/>Molecular analyses suggest that there is evidence of gene flow between <em>C. vellerosus </em>and the high-altitude subpopulation formerly classified as <em>C. nationi</em> (Abba <em>et al</em>. 2015). Despite subtle morphological differences in skull shape, high-altitude specimens are similar in size to specimens of the subspecies <em>C. v. vellerosus</em>, with which they also share mitochondrial haplotypes. They might thus be viewed as being part of this subspecies. Nevertheless, the reality of the subspecies definition within <em>C. vellerosus</em> requires more detailed phylogeographic and population genetics studies.<br/><br/>The distance between the distribution areas of the high-altitude armadillos formerly classified as <em>C. nationi </em>and <em>C. vellerosus</em> is around 80 km (Abba <em>et al</em>. 2015), and there is no obvious geographic barrier that would prevent contact between individuals of the two subpopulations. Actually, this gap probably reflects the scarcity of field studies and the corresponding lack of geo-referenced localities from the potential area of contact. Small hairy armadillos have indeed recently been observed in this area (Abba <em>et al</em>. 2015). As a consequence, the high-altitude armadillos formerly identified as <em>C. nationi </em>cannot be considered a subpopulation under the IUCN definition (“Subpopulations are defined as geographically or otherwise distinct groups in the population between which there is little demographic or genetic exchange (typically one successful migrant individual or gamete per year or less”).",Stable,"<em>Chaetophractus vellerosus</em> is generally known from the Chaco region of Bolivia (Cuéllar and Noss 2003, Noss <em>et al</em>. 2008), Paraguay and Argentina (Gardner 2005, Abba <em>et al</em>. 2012). A disjunct population occurs in eastern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Crespo 1974; Carlini and Vizcaíno 1987; Abba <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2011; Abba and Cassini 2008). Recent studies have confirmed that <em>C. nationi</em> is an invalid species and a synonym of <em>C. vellerosus</em> (Abba <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Gibb <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). Hence, the distribution of <em>C. vellerosus</em> now also includes the high altitudes of Chile (Arica y Parinacota, Antofagasta, Tarapacá), Bolivia and Argentina. Its presence in Peru is uncertain (V. Pacheco, pers. comm. 2016). The species occurs at altitudes from sea level to 4,600 m asl.","<em>Chaetophractus vellerosus</em> is hunted as a protein source throughout its range. In Bolivia the carapaces are also intensely used to manufacture <em>charangos</em> (traditional music instruments) and the whole bodies are made into <em>matracas</em> or <em>maracas</em> (rattles), which are used in traditional dances—especially during the carnival in Oruro. These armadillos are also made into amulets and souvenirs (Romero-Muñoz and Pérez-Zubieta 2008, Pérez Zubieta <em>et al.</em> 2009).",Terrestrial,"<em>Chaetophractus vellerosus</em>&#160;is present in a number of protected areas, including the Kaa-Iya National Park in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

The high-altitude armadillos, formerly known as <em>C. nationi</em>, were previously listed as Vulnerable (VU A2acd; IUCN 2014). This species, which is now a synonym of <em>C. vellerosus</em>, was considered Endangered (EN) in Bolivia (Pérez-Zubieta <em>et al</em>. 2009), Chile (DS 5/1998 MINAGRI, Servicio Agrícola Ganadero 1998), and in Peru (Supreme Decree 004-2014 MINAGRI) although its presence in the latter country is uncertain, and Data Deficient (DD) in Argentina (Superina <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, <em>C. nationi</em> is included in CITES Appendix II (CITES 2013), which establishes a zero annual exportation quota for this species due to its traditional use (Peredo 1999).<br/><br/>These animals are considered emblematic of the Bolivian highlands, particularly from the Oruro department (Cáceres 2004) where they are closely linked to the cultural heritage.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species is targeted for local consumption across most of its range and is increasingly targeted for international trafficking – mainly its scales – to overseas markets, mainly China. There appears to have been a shift in trafficking attention to this species following declines in populations of the Sunda and Chinese Pangolin. This dynamic is compounded by the likelihood that law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within three generations time, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, and the incentives for harvesting and illegally trading the species are high across the species' range based on the high financial value of pangolin scales.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","Generally, little is known about the natural history of this species, but it is understood to occur in various types of tropical forests as well as open land, grasslands, arid areas and degraded habitat, including in close proximity to villages (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977). The species is thought to adapt well to modified habitats, provided its ant and termite prey remains abundant and provided it is not subject to hunting pressure. The species uses olfaction to locate prey and is prey selective: in Pakistan, two species of black ants, <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">Camponotus confucii</em> and <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">C. compressus</em> comprised the majority of prey consumed, with one termite species, <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">Odontotermi sobesus</em> comprising a much smaller proportion based on fecal analysis in the Potohar Plateau (Irshad<em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;""> et al.</em> 2015).<br/>The Indian Pangolin is generally solitary, nocturnal and burrow-dwelling except when mating, when adult males and females share the same burrow, which are often under large rocks and the entrance concealed by dirt (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977, Tikader 1983). Adult Indian Pangolins weigh 10-20 kg and grow to up to 148 cm long (Mahmood<em> et al. </em>2019). The species displays sexual dimorphism, where males are generally larger and heavier than females (Roberts 1977). The tail, often almost the same length as the body (Irshad <em>et al</em>. 2016), is used for climbing trees and for balance when walking (Prater 1971). Similarly, this species possesses a long tongue, reaching up to 42.5 cm in length, which is used to capture and ingest prey (Irshad <em>et al</em>. 2016). Individuals have strong forelimbs with large and powerful claws used for excavating ant nests and termite mounds, as well as for grip when climbing. Vital for seeking prey and searching for a mate, the Indian Pangolin has excellent olfactory senses (Roberts 1977). Females usually give birth to one young, although twins are reported (Mahmood<em> et al. </em>2015b) after a gestation period of approximately six months. Juveniles are nursed by the mother, who will coil around her young (Acharjyo 2000, Mohapatra and Panda 2014) and carry it on her tail for protection whilst foraging (Roberts 1977, Israel <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 1987). It is estimated sexual maturity is reached at 3 years (see Mahmood <em>et al</em>. 2019). Longevity in the wild is unknown, but in captivity an individual persisted for 19 years (Weigl 2005). Although mainly ground-dwelling, this species is arboreal in some habitats, and is a good climber, using its prehensile tail and claws to climb trees (Prater 1971, Heath 1995).","<p>The Indian Pangolin is primarily threatened by overexploitation including hunting and poaching for both its meat and scales which are used and consumed at a local, subsistence level, but increasingly for illegal international trade (Misra and Hanfee 2000; Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). This species has historically been exploited locally. Its meat is consumed as a source of protein locally (e.g., in India, Kanagavel <em>et al.</em> 2016) and its scales have been used in whole or powdered form in the preparation of traditional medicines and as curios in Pakistan (Roberts 1977). There is evidence that the species is being severely impacted in Pakistan i.e. directly targeted and killed so the scales can be removed and illegally exported to China and it is suspected that this has caused local extirpations (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012). In India, hunting of pangolins has been recorded in Arunachal Pradesh, and specifically regarding the Indian Pangolin hunting/poaching is known to occur Periyar Tiger reserve (Kerala), the Western Ghats and eastern states of India including Odisha (Mitra 1998, Misra and Hanfee 2000; Gubbi and Linkie 2012). There are also reports of the involvement of tribal communities such as <em>Padhis, Saperas, Bawarias </em>and <em>Mongias </em>in the capture of pangolins (Sharma 2014) and pangolin scales have reportedly increased in price (prior to export) in India in the last 20 years (Chinlampianga<em> et al.</em> 2013). The meat, bile, scales and claws of pangolins are reportedly used by tribal communities including the <em>Paaudi Bhuanya </em>tribe of Odisha, <em>Biate </em>tribe of Assam, <em>Katkaris </em>folk of Maharashtra, <em>Gond </em>tribe of Madhya Pradesh, and <em>Mizo </em>ethnic group of Mizoram (Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015). D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> (2018) report that pangolins, both Chinese and Indian species continue to be hunted and consumed locally, but the scales are illegally exported because of the high financial returns available.</p><p>There has been limited trade in this species reported to CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (see Challender and Waterman 2017). <span lang=""EN-US"">However, the species has been trafficked since at least the early 2000s for consumptive use in China (Wu and Ma 2007). International t<span lang=""EN-US"">rafficking today primarily involves scales, which are sourced from all range states, including Sri Lanka, and are primarily destined for China. T<span lang=""EN-US"">he scales are either shipped directly (e.g., by post) or are trafficked along routes through Myanmar and Nepal (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017, Perera <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is estimated that between 2011 and 2017 at least 1724 Indian Pangolin were trafficked internationally (Challender and Waterman 2017) though the actual number involved is likely much higher. This is partly because of low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and because the species of pangolin involved in wildlife trafficking are rarely identified. Challender<em> et al.</em> (2019) report that between 2000 and 2018, a combination of live animals, dead individuals and parts and derivatives equating to an estimated 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked globally. Trafficking in the Indian Pangolin may be related to declines in populations of the Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, and potentially <span lang=""EN-US"">increasing awareness of the monetary value of scales (D’Cruze <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;</span></span></p><p>Other threats<span lang=""EN-US""> include the expansion of agriculture, habitat loss and deterioration, which opens up previously inaccessible areas to hunting and poaching, pesticide use and roadkill (Karawita <em>et al.</em> 2018, Murthy and Mishra 2010).</p>","<p>There is very limited information or data on population of this species at any level, and generally there is a lack of research on abundance. Historical accounts suggest the species is uncommon, rarely observed and occurs at low densities (Philips 1981, Roberts 1977). In the Potohar Plateau, Pakistan, Irshad<em> et al.</em> (2015) estimated population density based on counts of active burrows between 2010 and 2013. Across the four districts studied estimated density declined by ~79% between 2010 and 2012 (Irshad <em>et al.</em> 2015), which has been attributed to illegal capture and killing for international trade in pangolin scales (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012). Similarly, in 2012 estimated densities comprised 0.37 ± 0.12 individuals/km² in Chakwal, 0.12 ± 0.08 individuals/km² in Jhelum, 0.10 ± 0.00 individuals/km² in Rawalpindi, and 0.33 ± 0.24 individuals/km² in Attock (Irshad <em>et al.</em> 2015). Using the same method, M<span>ahmood<em> et al.</em> (2015a) estimated an average density 0.36 individuals/km² in Margalla Hills National Park, and 0.00044 individuals/km² in Maneshra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, it should be noted that there are limitation to the methods used here; it can be inferred from other species of pangolin that this species likely uses multiple burrows in a very short period and as such these estimated should be treated with caution (see Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2019 for discussion on methods).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, <span lang=""EN-US"">Pabasara <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated population density at Yagirala Forest Reserve in the southwest of the country&#160; to be 5.69 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, based on modelling camera trap records without identification of individual animals (see Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). This is potentially an underestimate based on known exploitation of populations in the area. These densities are far higher than anywhere else in the species’ range and may be due to habitat differences, i.e. tropical lowland rainforest supporting a broader and more abundant prey base. Overexploitation of populations by excessive hunting may have almost eliminated pangolins from some parts of the country (P. Perera, pers. comm).<br/></span></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are no quantitative population data available for India, Nepal or Bangladesh though it can be inferred and/or suspected that populations in each range state are in decline based on indiscriminate and apparently increasing rates of exploitation. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that between 2000 and 2018 around 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked internationally, though it is difficult to accurately quantify how much of this illegal trade involved the Indian Pangolin. <span lang=""EN-US"">T<span lang=""EN-US"">here are contemporary records of the species in various protected areas (see the Geographic Range setcion). Further research is needed to determine the status of populations in all range states, including Bangladesh, and the impact of exploitation for local use and international trafficking.&#160;</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in South Asia from northern and southeastern Pakistan through much of India south of the Himalayas (excluding far northeastern portions of the country), southern Nepal, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977, Schlitter 2005, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). The species is likely to occur in northern and western Bangladesh (A. Ghose and S. Trageser, pers. comm.). Some reference works refer to the occurrence of the species in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, but there is no evidence to support this, and there are no records from Myanmar (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>This species is very locally distributed in Pakistan but has been recorded in all four provinces. In the north it has been recorded in Sialkot, Jhelum and Gujrat Districts in Punjab, extending across the Salt Range into Kohat District, and from Attock District (formerly known as Campbellpur) up to Mardan and Peshawar in the North West Frontier Province (Roberts 1977). There are also records from before 2009 in Nowshera and Swabi (F. Abbas, unpubl. data). It has also been found in the Potohar Plateau Range upwards into the Himalayan foothills (up to 750 m asl). This species is also present in the districts of Kotli, Mirpur and Bhimber in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (R. Hussain, unpubl. data). There are records of the species within the last five years from the Indus River floodplain, including the districts of Bhakar and Jhang (F. Abbas, unpubl. data). Further south there are records from the hilly regions in the western part of the Dadu and Larkana deserts (Sindh), extending southward through Las Bela and Mekran. It also occurs east of the Indus in Hyderabad district and Tharparkar, extending eastwards to Kutch (Roberts 1977).</p><p>Widely distributed in India from the Himalayan foothills to the far south, except the far northeast (Tikader, 1983).

The is the eastern most record of the species, and it possibly occurs in Meghalaya (Agrawal <em>et al</em>. 1992).

123584856,12763,Manis javanica,Critically Endangered,A2d+3d+4d,2019,2019-05-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Critically Endangered (A2d+3d+4d). It is inferred that populations have declined by 80% over the past 21 years (three generations, generation length estimated at seven years, i.e. 1998-2019) based on overexploitation from hunting and poaching (A2d). Being precautionary, the species is listed as Critically Endangered (A3d+4d), both looking forward three generations (2019-2040) and looking backward one generations and forward two generations (2012-2033). This is based on very high levels of harvest for commercial trafficking of live and dead individuals, industrially processed frozen pangolins, and scales, seemingly across the species’ range, combined with ongoing exploitation for local use. Quantifying the extent of exploitation spatially is difficult but it seems likely that Singapore and smaller islands (e.g., those surrounding mainland and island Southeast Asia in the species’ range) may be the only localities where overexploitation is not a threat. This predicament is compounded by a number of factors including the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within three generations time. Additionally, there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, are effective. Meanwhile, the incentives for harvesting and illegally trading in the species are universally high based on the high financial value of pangolin parts and derivatives.</p>","<p>This species is found in primary and secondary forest, including lowland dipterocarp forest, and cultivated areas – including oil palm and rubber plantations – including and near human settlements (e.g., in gardens; Nowak 1999, Azhar et al. 2013, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2019). Hunters interviewed in Viet Nam reported that the species is found in a variety of habitats, though areas with primary forest support higher abundances, likely because they contain more older, larger trees with hollows suitable for sleeping and for use as den sites (Newton <em>et al</em>. 2008, see also Lim and Ng 2008) and support lower levels of human activity. While there have been no targeted field studies on abundance and population densities in Singapore, the Sunda Pangolin has persisted for decades without an obvious decline in parts of the city where forest quality is not high (Nash et al. 2019). This is likely due to the lack of strong habitat and diet preferences (Lim 2007) and low levels of hunting/poaching. However, further research is required into habitat utilization and the ability of this species to persist outside primary forest in the long-term. A recent study reported that the Sunda Pangolin was found to be able to utilise boulder cavities as dens in areas of high disturbance in Kelantan, Malaysia (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016). Similarly, a study in Malaysian Borneo recorded Sunda Pangolins more frequently in modified habitat than primary forest, but it is unclear if this is the result of easier detection rather than being the species being more abundant in this habitat and this requires further research (Davies and Payne 1982).</p>  <p>As with most other species of pangolin, the Sunda Pangolin is primarily nocturnal, solitary – except when breeding – and is a specialized feeder on ants and termites. The species is thought to play a role in regulating insect populations. Lim and Ng (2008) observed that Sunda Pangolins foraged for ant species for 67% of the time versus 33% for termite species. The species also consumes ant larvae, bee pupas, flies, worms, crickets, and other insect larvae, as well as sand and grass (Hua <em>et al.</em> 2015). Sunda Pangolins have an observed preference for Oecophylla ant species (weaver ants), both in the wild and in captivity (Lim, 2007; Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014), and for <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em> (the Yellow Crazy Ant; Lim 2007). Sunda Pangolins will also eat <em>Crematogaster</em> spp. in captivity (Nguyen <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2014), though this species was avoided in the wild in Singapore (Lim 2007).</p>  <p>Sunda Pangolins breed all year round (Lim and Ng 2008, Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2015), although breeding may be seasonal in the northern parts of the species’ range, due to colder temperatures reducing prey activity during the winter months. The species has low fecundity, giving birth to one young after a gestation period of about 6 months (180 days; Nguyen <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2015). Lim and Ng (2008) recorded the activity budget of a radio-tracked female with young and concluded that maternal care following the birth of a single offspring was for approximately three to four months. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2012) witnessed behaviour in captivity concurring with this. Lim and Ng (2008) reported that three natal dens were used, all associated with hollows in large trees (&gt;50 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]); female home-range size was estimated as being 6.97 ha, and daily activity was 127 ± 13.1 minutes (mean&#160;± SE.E), with peak activity between 03h00 and 06h00. Adult male home range based on radio-tracking four individuals was 41.3 ha, daily activity was 165 ± 14 minutes, and 11 genera of ants (67% of diet) were foraged upon (Lim 2007). Lim (2007) observed males displaying territorial behaviour suggesting the species is territorial.</p>  <p>There is little information on mortality rates but it is thought to be high due to indiscriminate poaching, meaning individuals are poached regardless of their age or sex. Further information is needed on survival rates of Sunda Pangolins that are released back into the wild and the impact of releases on resident populations. A number of parasites and diseases have been associated with Sunda Pangolins, some of which can be picked up by trafficked individuals during transportation – pangolin are often kept in poor, unsanitary conditions – therefore there is a risk of transmission between the recently released pangolin and the wild population.</p>  <p>Hunters in Viet Nam consistently reported that the Sunda Pangolin is more arboreal than the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>). They are adept climbers and their prehensile tails make excellent climbing aids. They often climb to access ants nests, including weaver ants, in trees (Lim 2007). They sleep in hollows either in, or at the base of, trees, but have also been known to dig burrows in soil and shelter in fallen logs. Females may be dependent on tree hollows around parturition and whilst caring for infants (Lim and Ng 2008). By excavating burrows, as well as ant nests and termite mounds whilst searching for prey, Sunda Pangolins are thought to aerate the soil, facilitating the nutrient cycle, and play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>  <p>The species is also a capable swimmer, like other pangolin species, and appears well adapted to wetland ecosystems e.g., the U Minh wetlands in Viet Nam (Willcox<em> et al. </em>2017). The Sunda Pangolin has also been observed frequenting pools of water when cared for in captivity (Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","<p>The primary threat to the Sunda Pangolin is overexploitation from hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use. The latter is largely driven by demand in China and Viet Nam and associated incentives to supply those markets, and involves industrial quantities of live and dead animals and their meat and scales each year (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017). In China and Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed as a luxury product in high end urban restaurants (as well as more locally e.g., on the fringes of protected areas in Viet Nam), and the scales are used as an ingredient in traditional medicines to purportedly cure skin ailments, improve blood circulation and stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, as well as to treat other illnesses, including cancer (Yu and Hong 2018). Contemporary trade routes are sophisticated and extensive occurring over land and by sea (Sopyan 2009). Heinrich <em>et al.</em> (2017) studied the global pangolin trade and found a mean of 29 new routes each year between 2010 and 2015. Trafficking today follows a heavy international trade historically. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trade data between 1975 and 2018, trade in this species included ~500,000 animals, which mainly comprised skins that were traded to North America, mainly between 1978 and 2000. However, evidence indicates a heavy, unrecorded, illegal trade involving live animals and scales took place simultaneously, potentially involving an additional 500,000-935,000 Sunda Pangolin (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015). Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that trafficking in Asian pangolins between 2001 and 2018 potentially involved &gt;280,000 individuals, most of which involved this species.<br/></p><p>The pervasive snaring throughout South East Asia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017b) means Sunda Pangolins, like all ground-dwelling mammals, are at risk of accidental mortality or injuries in most forests across the region. Local use also comprises a threat, though evidence suggests this is now largely forgone in favour of international trade, given the high monetary value of this species (Newton <em>et al. </em>2008, MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). Hunting and poaching of the Sunda Pangolin may take place to meet subsistence needs and the ultimate driver is absolute or relative poverty, though in some areas poaching appears to be opportunistic and undertaken by hobbyists as well as organised criminal syndicates (Pantel and Anak 2010). It is compounded by the ease with which the species can be captured once found, ineffective and insufficient enforcement in most range states and a lack of resources dedicated to conservation efforts. It is thought that icreasing demand combined with a decreasing supply of Sunda Pangolins has resulted in poaching in areas that were previously considered too costly and inaccessible for hunting.</p><p>This species is known to be harvested for international trade in both live animals and scales in Myanmar, as evidenced by seizures in China (Challender and Waterman 2017). Myanmar, on the basis of its geographic position, size and weak government, has emerged as an important transit country for the smuggling of pangolins to China; although the origin of pangolins is often unclear, trade seems to comprise a mixture of pangolins from Myanmar and neighbouring countries (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2015). The northern Myanmar region has been identified as a potential transit and source place for the illegal trade of pangolins and their scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2017).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>The population in the southern part of Thailand has crashed because of trade and in the last few years many pangolins have been confiscated from illegal traders (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species is hunted by specially trained dogs, which can smell it out, making hunting much more effective. Habitat loss, often in the form of deliberate and accidental burning of forests, constitutes a secondary threat to the species here.</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>In Cambodia, the threat to the Sunda Pangolin from hunting and poaching is increasing due to rising prices, and loggers are expending more effort hunting pangolins due to a decrease in luxury wood in the forest (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013). Pangolins are also often hunted using trained detection dogs and certain villages (e.g., those around Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong) are known to specialise in training and deploying such dogs (T. Gray in litt. 2017). In protected areas in the Northern Plains complex, local villagers are financially rewarded for simply reporting pangolin signs to local traders and middlemen (A. Suzuki in litt. 2017).</p>  <p>In Lao PDR, interviews with villagers in the 1990s suggested populations had declined by up to 90% within a decade (i.e., between the 1980s and 1990s; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999), though there is a lack of hard data supporting this (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Consequently, trafficking in the last decade (2009-2019) has originated or been exported from Malaysia and Indonesia, and is destined for China, based on seizure data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Both Lao PDR and Thailand play a key role as transit countries in regional trade involving live animals. Lao PDR is being exploited as a low-risk transport hub for illegal wildlife goods, including pangolins. Lao PDR’s weak laws and ineffective enforcement allow pangolins from both Asian and African countries to be shipped through the country and into consumer countries, such as China and Viet Nam. Between 2010 and 2015, Lao PDR was involved in a total of 43 reported trafficking incidents, in which it was either a seizure (2.3%), origin (32.6%), transit (44.2%) or destination country (23.3%). Thirty-three incidents (76.7%) exclusively involved Asian countries (meaning they did not involve African or non-range countries), and accounted for an estimated ~3,015 pangolins. Based on seizure data from (2010-2015), Asian pangolin species are often smuggled from Indonesia or Malaysia into Lao PDR through Thailand and involve both live and dead or frozen pangolins (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).</p>  <p>Eighty-four hunters in Viet Nam were interviewed and every one reported that they now sell all pangolins that they catch (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Prices are so high that local, subsistence use of pangolins, for either meat or their scales, has completely halted in favour of selling to the national or international trade (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013). The only occasions on which a hunter might eat a pangolin is if it is already dead when they retrieve it from a trap, then they would use the meat and sell the scales (P. Newton, pers. comm.). The price per kg of pangolin, paid to hunters (in Viet Nam at least) escalated rapidly in the decade up to 2007 and since the commercial trafficking in pangolins began to expand in about 1990 (P. Newton pers. comm.). The main threat in Viet Nam remains hunting therefore, including taking pangolins caught as non-target species. This species is in demand in urban centres such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City both for meat – a luxury product –&#160; and scales, and which is attributed to increasing affluence following economic reforms in the late 20th century. Viet Nam is a persistent consumer market in Asia for wildlife species and this is a key factor in the decline of the species in Viet Nam and surrounding regions (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). After two decades of rapid economic growth, newly wealthy consumers are purchasing wildlife to advertise their status, including luxury wild meats the price of which is usually associated with the rarity of a species and its wild origins. Pangolins are often the most expensive meat on the menu in Vietnamese restaurants (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Shairp<em> et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Malaysia has been experiencing targeted hunting and poaching almost exclusively for international trade in meat and scales in recent years and though this includes foreigners, it mostly involves Malaysian nationals. Reported price increases have acted to create a strong incentive to poach and enter the species into national and international trafficking (Pantel and Anak 2010, Chong <em>et al</em>. 2016). This is attracting poachers from outside the country (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Increasing land conversion for palm oil throughout Malaysia has created easy road access for poachers. The longevity of palm oil cycles (i.e. the removal of old palms and the replanting of new, which occurs on average every 25 years, suggests that where this species does persist in these habitats (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016), it may not be viable in the long term, though further research on such dynamics is needed. Malaysia also plays a key role as a transit country for the movement of pangolins, mostly live individuals and meat, from Indonesia to China (Challender and Waterman 2017).&#160;</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Indonesia has been illegally exporting large numbers of live pangolins as well as meat, especially since 2000, some of which comes from east Kalimantan (Sopyan 2009). Targeted hunting and poaching is the biggest threat in Indonesia, especially on Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java, as evidenced by seizures involving several thousands pangolins over the last two decades (Pantel and Chin 2009, Sopyan 2009).</p>  <p>In Singapore, roadkill is seemingly the biggest threat to this species and though poaching does occur here, it is not thought to be a significant problem.<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p>Secondary threats include habitat loss, largely driven by commercial operations, such as logging, mining and hydro-power dams, and the construction of roads, which has facilitated hunting and poaching by opening previously inaccessible areas. Across Lao PDR, Cambodia and Indonesia this has occurred even within protected areas. The conversion of primary forest to agricultural land is a major driver of habitat loss. This is particularly common in Malaysia and Thailand with habitat replaced with large-scale oil, rubber and paper and pulp plantations. The severity of the threat from habitat loss is not well understood given the species' ability to survive in modified landscapes. However, the ability of the species to persist long-term in habitats such as oil palm and rubber plantations is unknown and commands research attention.</p>","<p>There are very little quantitative data on Sunda Pangolin populations at any level (local, national or international), with the exception of Singapore (see below). This species is rarely observed, principally because of its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, elusive and primarily nocturnal. There is a paucity of research on population densities at all scales (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, population declines are inferred in various places based on the knowledge of local community members and indigenous peoples and from shifting trade dynamics, both legal and illegal. For instance pangolins are now being poached in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Africa to meet demand which has been met from Southeast Asia in recent decades, mainly Malaysia and Indonesia (Challender and Hywood 2012, Gomez et al. 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017), following declines in populations of the Sunda Pangolin in the north of its range and Chinese Pangolin (Zhang 2008, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2019)</p>  <p>This species is now extremely rare in the northern part of its range where there have been massive declines in Indochina (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nooreen and Claridge 2001). </p>  <p>It is listed as Endangered in Viet Nam (Nguyen, 2007). In three areas of Viet Nam where interviews were conducted (Khe Net Protected Area, Ke Go Nature Reserve and Song Thanh National Park), 95% of hunters believed pangolins populations have declined severely, because of hunting pressure (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Hunters reported that populations had massively declined in the last few decades, but particularly since about 1990, when the commercial trade in pangolins began to escalate (Newton 2007). In all three areas, the species was described as now being extremely rare. The intense biodiversity survey effort and extremely limited number of confirmed records of pangolins throughout Viet Nam's protected areas adds weight to this observation (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The rarity of the species was highlighted in more recent research in U Minh Thuong National Park (Nuwer and Bell 2013) and Quang Nam Province (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). </p>  <p>The species was listed as ‘Rare’ in Cambodia in 2003. There are no population estimates for the country but it is suspected the species is in decline. In a number of reserves in the Cardamom Mountains, this species is present but populations are heavily suspected to be declining. This includes the Elephant Mountains, Central Cambodian Lowland Forests (Prey Long), Eastern Plains Landscape, Northern Plains and Northeast Cambodia. Interviews with hunters suggest that the species is absent in some of these areas, which is attributed to hunting (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013), and it is likely that these declines have continued since this appraisal.&#160;</p>  <p>In three separate areas within the range of the Sunda Pangolin in Lao PDR (Xe Pian, Dong Phou Veng and Khammouan Limestone National Biodiversity Conservation Area [NBCA]), villagers reported in the late 1990s that pangolin populations had declined due to hunting; in some areas, to as little as one percent of numbers 30 years ago, i.e. (since the 1960s; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nooren and Claridge 2001). The species has largely been extirpated from the lowlands in Lao PDR and is being exploited where areas that were not previously accessible are opening up due to development, including the expansion of agro-industrial plantations (D. Willcox, pers. comm.). </p>  <p>In Peninsular Malaysia, the species has previously been described as common in some areas, at least up until 1999 (Ickes and Thomas 2003). It was listed as Vulnerable in Peninsular Malaysia in 2012. Azhar <em>et al.</em> (2013) report its presence in oil palm plantations in Selangor and Negri Sembilan, though it is subject to very heavy hunting pressure here. According to Numata <em>et al.</em> (2005) the species is present in Pasoh Forest Reserve. Based on recent camera trap data, the species is also present in the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor (D.W.S. Challender, pers. comms. 2013) and also as roadkill in Kenyir (J.L. Chong, J. L. pers. comm. 2017). However, interviews with hunters and villagers in 2007 and 2011 indicate populations in Peninsular Malaysia are decreasing as a result of hunting pressure for trade (D.W.S. Challender, unpubl. data, J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). This is supported by results of pangolin hunting frequency and patterns of the Orang Asli in Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>In Sabah, the Sunda Pangolin has previously been considered relatively common, but there is little recent data on the species' status here. Populations are under pressure from collection for both local use and international trafficking, which seems to have intensified in recent years, and is inferred to be having a detrimental impact on population levels. For example, Pantel and Anak (2010) report that &gt;22,000 Sunda Pangolin were collected for illicit export in the state in an 18 -month period in Sabah between 2007 and 2009. In February 2019, local authorities seized ~30 tonnes of Sunda Pangolins in Sabah, involving frozen animals, live animals and their skins and scales (Anon 2019).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>In Sarawak, recent data are lacking, but it is believed that populations are under heavy collection pressure for local use, mostly as Sunda Pangolin meat is favoured as a protein source, but the species is also in trade and it is inferred to be causing a decline in the wild populations (J.L. Chong unpubl. data).&#160; </p>  <p>There is a small population in Singapore that might be stable. A recent estimate put the population in the country at 1068 individuals (D. Fung Yu En, unpubl. data). The species is listed as Critically Endangered in Singapore (Davison <em>et al.,</em> 2008).</p>  <p>There is no recent data on the status of this species in Myanmar; though seizures involving the Sunda Pangolin in China in recent years infer that trade originated in Myanmar, suggesting populations of this species here are under threat (Challender and Waterman 2017). It is thought the Sunda Pangolin has been lost from lowland areas due to hunting and habitat conversion to agricultural land.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>The Sunda Pangolin is considered threatened and is becoming increasingly rare in Thailand (Bain and Humphrey 1982).<br/></p>  <p>Evidence from seizures involving this species attest that it is present in some numbers in Indonesia (including Sumatra, Java and Kalimantan). However, the magnitude of international trafficking originating from Indonesia in the last decade suggests populations here are, or could be, in severe decline. Stating categorically that this is the case is difficult due to a lack of information on past or present population levels, and warrants further research. The estimated generation length of seven years, the indiscriminate nature of poaching and the magnitude of seized trade supports this assertion (Challender and Waterman 2017). For example, there have been seizures comprising 11, 14 and 17 tonnes of Sunda Pangolins between 2000 and 2013, each of which involved several thousand animals, and which likely comprises only a fraction of the trade, based on low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade. In Bali, local people report that thirty years ago pangolins would wander into household gardens around Ubud and central Bali whereas now it is hard to find them. Apparently, the northern parts of Bali have higher abundance but the species is generally very rare (H. Nash, unpubl. data).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sunda Pangolin is widely distributed geographically, occurring across mainland and island Southeast Asia, from central Myanmar south through western, southeasterrn and southern Thailand, lowland Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), central and southern Viet Nam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. It then occurs on Sumatra, Java and adjacent islands (Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam) and surrounding islands. The northern and western limits of its range are poorly known (Schlitter 2005). Wu <em>et al.</em> (2005) note the occurrence of the species in Yunnan Province, southwestern China based on specimens at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, but there is uncertainty over the provenance of these specimens and thereby occurrence of the species in China (Chong <em>et al. </em>2019). Further details on distribution within each range state are provided below. &#160;&#160;</p><p>Altitudinal limits are not well understood, but in the northern part of its range the species probably does not widely occur above 600 m asl (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Moreover, individuals in captivity north of the Sunda Pangolin’s estimated geographic range have high mortality rates, often dying from exposure due to colder temperatures (Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program, unpubl. data). On Borneo, the species has been recorded up to 1,700 m asl at Mount Kinabalu (Payne <em>et al.</em> 1985) and there is a specimen in the Natural History Museum in London from 1,500 m asl. from Lombok, Indonesia (P. Newton, unpubl. data). Kaicheen and Mohd-Azlan (2018) recorded the species at &gt;1,200 m in the Mt. Penrissen area, Sarawak. Despite being present in a number of protected areas (PAs - see the Conservation section) across its range, these are mostly located in poorly accessible areas – either they are at high altitudes or they have steep terrains – meaning they offer limited protection for the Sunda Pangolin, as it is mostly found at altitudes below 1,000 m asl in Indochina, Myanmar and Thailand. It is suspected that the species has been extirpated from some lowland areas of Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand, and is highly vulnerable in other lowland areas in these countries as well as Cambodia and Viet Nam.</p><p>It appears likely that the detectability of pangolins from conventional large mammal focused camera trapping is low, thus data (or its absence) from camera trap by-catch information may not provide as much value for pangolins as many other species of ground-dwelling mammals in tropical Asia. For example, the Sunda Pangolin was detected from 11 of 65 randomly set-up camera trap stations (across ~8,000 camera trap nights) in the <a name=""_Hlk12368739"">Southern Cardamom National Park, Cambodia</a>, despite no previous records from more than 22,000 camera-trap nights previously in the landscape (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017a).</p>  <p>This species is distributed in central and southern Myanmar (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992), but has apparently been eradicated widely from lowland areas due to human agricultural expansion and hunting (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). The species has been recorded in the Tanintharyi region in the south (Challender and Waterman 2017). Moo <em>et al.</em> (2017) recorded<em> Manis</em> spp. in Karen State in Myanmar which likely comprises this species. Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) recorded this species in Hkakborazi National Park in northern Myanmar in the early 2000s but there is uncertainty over the species identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and this record may refer to the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>)<em>.</em><br/></p><p><em></em>The species historically occurred throughout Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Bain and Humphrey 1982), but, like in Myanmar, has reportedly been lost from most of the lowland areas due to agricultural expansion and hunting/poaching (J.W. Duckworth and R. Steinmitz pers. comm. 2006). Camera-trap data confirms the presence of the species in <a name=""_Hlk12368865"">Khao Yai National Park</a> (ZSL 2017) and there are records from Khao Ang Ru Nai Wildlife Sanctuary (Jenks et al., 2012), Kaeng Krachan National Park (W. Sodsai, unpubl. data), Khlong Nakha Wildlife Sanctuary, and the southeastern western forest complex (sWEFCOM) in Kanchanaburi Province (ZSL, 2017), as well as Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary in the far south (Kitamura et al., 2010). The species occurs also on islands e.g., Ko Ra, Phang Nga Province (GVI, unpubl. data).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p>Recent research suggests the species is present but rare in central and southern Viet Nam (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013), however records from these areas vary in reliability. There are older records from Kon Tum Province, Tay Ninh Province and Quang Nam Province (Bourret 1942). Meanwhile, there are more recent records (summarised by Newton 2007) from Ha Tinh Province (Timmins and Cuong 1999), Kien Giang and Ca Mau Provinces (in <a name=""_Hlk12372231"">U Minh Thuong National Park</a>) (CARE 2004), Dong Nai, Bin Phuoc and Lam Dong Provinces (<a name=""_Hlk12372258"">Cat Tien National Park</a>) (Murphy and Phan 2001), Quang Binh (Le <em>et al</em>. 1997a), and Dak Lak (Le&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997b). Recent enforcement activity suggests the species is still present in Dak Nong, Kon Tum, Quang Binh and Gia Lai provinces (L. Fletcher and A. Nguyen, unpubl. data). Based on camera trap data, the species is also present in <a name=""_Hlk12372414"">U Minh Ha National Park </a>(Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2017). Additionally, camera trap records from December 2012 to August 2014 recorded this species in <a name=""_Hlk12372454"">Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves in central Vietnam </a>(T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). The species was recorded in 2013 in Cat Tien National Park (Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, unpubl. data). Surveys using trained detection dogs have recorded the species in Cat Tien National Park and camera-trapping has recorded it in Pu Mat National Park (Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, unpubl. data), though it is unknown whether these were released animals. A Sunda pangolin was observed at night during reptile and amphibian surveys in Pu Mat National Park in 2014 (S. Trageser, pers. comm<em>. </em>2018) and it has been camera-trapped in Bach Ma National Park (A. Wilting, pers. comm. 2017).</p><p>This species was likely widespread in Lao PDR historically. There are records of varying reliability from a wide range of areas below <em>ca</em> 600 m asl. However, it is possible that in Lao PDR the species is restricted to the Mekong plain and adjacent foothills up to <em>c. </em>900 m asl, with a possible occurrence on the Bolaven Plateau, north from <a name=""_Hlk12372677"">Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area </a>in the south and at least as far north as Nam Kading (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Nooren and Claridge (2001) reported that populations in Lao PDR have been severely reduced as a result of hunting for consumption and trade. Camera trap data from Nakai-Nam Thuen in 2016 recorded six instances of pangolins at six different stations, however as the range of the Sunda and Chinese Pangolins overlap here, it was not possible to identify the species (Coudrat 2017).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, the Sunda Pangolin has been recorded from sea level to 830 m asl (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2012, T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017) and historically occurred throughout deciduous forest, lowland and mountainous evergreen forest, and secondary forest prior to the extensive hunting driven declines that have likely occurred in the past 10-20 years. Extensive recent (meaning post-2012) camera trapping conducted across many of the country’s protected landscapes has generated very few records of this species (though as noted previously, it is difficult to detect pangolins within general large mammal focused camera trapping). For example, there are no post-2008 camera trap records of the Sunda Pangolin from Cambodia’s Eastern Plains Landscape despite more than 100,000 trap nights and a small number (less than five since 2012) of confiscations by law enforcement teams (R. Crouthers, O. Griffin and T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). However, there have been two records since 2010 from camera trapping in deciduous dipterocarp dominated areas of Preah Vihear Province in the Northern Plains (Songkom Thmey District, May 2017, G. McCann <em>in litt</em>. 2017, and Chep Wildlife Sanctuary (Suzuki <em>et al</em>. 2017) and one from the evergreen forest in Virachey National Park, Rattanakiri, at 830 m asl (McCann and Pawlowski 2017). The Songkom Thmey record was obtained from proactively investigating a “a small tunnel-like game trail” and further emphasises that targeted camera trapping may be necessary to detect the species. There have been more than 10 camera trap records since 2016 from low to mid (10-500 m asl) elevation evergreen forest in the Southern Cardamom National Park and northern Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong province (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017a). It is worth noting that at least two of the recent camera trap records were obtained from small sites managed for ecotourism. This level of intense benign human activity may be necessary to prevent hunting and it is possible that extinction in most of the country’s large, but insufficiently staffed or managed, protected areas is inevitable. It seems likely that numbers in Cambodia are depressed to such a level, particularly in accessible areas of the country, that detection during most biodiversity surveys is unlikely. Nevertheless, the species remains regularly confiscated by law enforcement teams throughout the country, with a total of 375 confiscations by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team between 2001 and 2016 (Wildlife Alliance <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Furthermore, between four and five individuals are confiscated annually in the landscape by the Wildlife Alliance law enforcement teams (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Other recent records (for example, there are at least two from central Phnom Penh since 2014) may involve individuals that have escaped from wildlife trade, rather than representing wild animals (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>The species is widely distributed geographically in Peninsular Malaysia, primarily in forest, but also in gardens and plantations, including oil palm and rubber plantations (Medway 1977, Numata <em>et al</em>. 2005). It is also found on the island of Penang. Numata <em>et al. </em>(2005) and Ickes and Thomas (2003) note its presence in oil palm and regenerating lowland dipterocarp forest in and around Pasoh Forest Reserve, where it was previously considered common. The Sunda Pangolin<em> </em>remains&#160;present within oil palm plantations in Selangor and Negri Sembilan, Peninsular Malaysia, based on interviews with plantation workers (Azhar <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, Azhar <em>et al.</em> (2013) also report that in areas where interviews have been conducted, it is in decline from hunting for trade. Additionally, the species is present in Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu, based on interviews with the Orang Asli hunters (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2016), who also reported that the populations there are decreasing (J.L. Chong pers. comm. 2017). Camera trap data from Kelantan and Terengganu produced just a single record of a Sunda Pangolin, despite an effort of 4,364 and 3,453 nights, respectively (Jambari <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>This species is widely distributed on Borneo, including Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia. It has been recorded in mixed dipterocarp forest and riverine forest (Azlan and Engkamat 2013), as well as remnant forests in this region (Giman <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al. </em>2007).

Panjang, unpubl. dataa). It is rarely seen in Sabah, especially compared to 10 years ago (E. Panjang, unpubl. data). Interviews were conducted with local communities and plantation workers living near Sepilok-Kabili Forest Reserve between 2011-2015 and Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary between 2016-2019. Respondents claimed that pangolins became rare about 20-30 years ago.

The species does appear as part of the bushmeat trade in Sarawak, especially in markets in Kuching, Sibu and Kapit (J.L. Chong pers. comm. 2017). Kaicheen and Mohd-Azlan (2018) recorded the species at &gt;1,200 m in the Mt. Penrissen area in 2015-2017.<br/></p><p>The abundance of this species is understood to be low in the peat-swamp forests of east and central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2012), but otherwise has a widespread distribution in Indonesia on Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Kiau and Lingga archipelago, Bangka and Belitung, Nias and Pagi islands, Bali and adjacent islands (Corbet and Hill 1992), as well as the Great Bunguran Islands (Natuna Islands) on the northwest coast of Borneo (Phillips and Phillips 2018).&#160;In Bali, local people report that thirty years ago pangolins would wander into household gardens around Ubud and central Bali, whereas now it is hard to find them. The northern parts of Bali have a slightly higher abundance, but they are very rare today (H. Nash, unpubl. data). There are also records from Tanggamus and Lampung Barat Districts in West Java, where the species was found in secondary forests and plantations, ranging between 360-900 m asl. The species was reported in Brunei Darussalam by Medway (1977), which is supported by the 'rescue' of a small number of individuals in 2013. It is reported to occur in all four districts in Brunei Darussalam: Brunei Muara, Tutong, Kuala Belait and Temburong (Fletcher 2016).</p>  <p>The species is still found in the wild in Singapore and adjacent islands, including Pulau Tekong and potentially, Pulau Ubin (Lim and Ng 2008). Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) receives around 20 wild pangolins per year – over 80% of which have been successfully released back into the wild.&#160;</p>","<p>This species has historically been exploited across its geographic range. This has primarily comprised hunting for local, subsistence level consumption, as a source of protein, as well as other uses, and for international trade in skins, scales and meat (Harrisson and Loh 1965, Anon 1992, 1999, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hafiz and Chong, 2016). There were high levels of international trade in skins from across the species' range in the 1970-1990s, most of which were destined for the United States and Mexico for the manufacture and sale of leather goods including boots, shoes and handbags among other leather items (Anon 1999, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), while the scales have been used, either in whole or powdered form, as an ingredient in traditional Chinese and Vietnamese medicine, and in other medicines (Anon 1992, 1999). Other uses include for ritualistic and spiritual purposes, such as protection against bad omens (Anon 1992).</p><p>Most trade reported to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) up to the year 2000 involved skins and scales (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), but there was also a parallel illegal trade involving substantial numbers of this species comprising a combination of live animals and scales for consumptive purposes that was principally destined to mainland China (live animals) and China, Taiwan (Province of China) and South Korea (scales; Anon 1992, 1999, Li and Li 1998, Wu and Ma 2007, Challender <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught Sunda Pangolins traded for commercial purposes (essentially a proxy trade ban). Despite this measure there has been an ongoing illicit trade in industrial volumes of live and dead Sunda Pangolins and their scales since, which culminated in the species being included in CITES Appendix I at CoP17 in 2016. Challender <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate that this trade may have involved more than 200,000 Sunda Pangolins exported from Southeast Asia and mainly destined for China and Viet Nam (see also Challender and Waterman 2017). In China and Viet Nam pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury dish and scales are used in traditional medicines (Shairp <em>et al. </em>2016, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Legislation prohibits the consumption of pangolin meat in China and Viet Nam, and scales in Viet Nam. In China, there is a legal market for pangolin scales which is regulated by the government. Although official Chinese pharmacopeia prescribe scales from the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>), Sunda Pangolins are used in traditional medicines in the country (see Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019). Prices for pangolin meat and scales in China and Viet Nam appear to have risen in recent years, plausibly due to a combination of the increasing rarity of Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, increasing demand and the risk to vendors of selling illegal products (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Challender <em>et al. </em>2015). A study on illegal trade in China suggested that illegal in trade in pangolins is considered easier than other wildlife products, such as ivory and rhino horn, because the products are small and easy to conceal, and is high-profit but apparently low-risk. In many parts of the Sunda Pangolin's range it is understood that traditional, subsistence use of pangolins and their products has been replaced by international trade due to the high financial value of pangolin derivatives (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013).&#160;</p><p>Other markets for illegal pangolin products also exist. The United States has recently been identified as an end-use market for pangolin products (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Although dated, Martin and Phipps (1996) noted Sunda Pangolin meat, scales and blood for sale in a restaurant in Cambodia. This practice continues today largely for Chinese expats and tourists (T. Gray in litt. 2017). Research suggests that animals caught in Cambodia are traded across the border to meet demand for luxury meat and scales in Viet Nam (D.W.S. Challender, unpubl. data). However, there have been a number of recent trade confiscations of the Sunda Pangolin on the Thailand-Cambodian border, originating from Thailand (Wildlife Alliance in litt. 2017), suggesting Cambodia may also be a transit or demand country for pangolin. Sunda Pangolins are also sourced in Cambodia and demand exists, particularly from Chinese restaurants in the country (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017b). </p>  <p>Lao PDR and Thailand both play key roles in illegal trade in live animals and scales from Southeast Asia to East Asia (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016). Trade routes typically follow Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand-Lao PDR-China/Viet Nam. Market observations in recent years within the northern regions of Lao PDR revealed an open trade in pangolin scales mostly for use in traditional medicine and to a lesser extent as jewellery (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>It is understood pangolin scales, as well as live animals, are sourced from Myanmar for international trade to China (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2016). Surveys in Mong La, Myanmar, revealed open trade in pangolin scales, skins, live pangolins and pangolin carcasses, including foetuses emerged in wine, which were observed at the central market, specialised wildlife shops, and in front of the restaurants and casinos. The pangolins and their derivatives are believed to be sourced locally, as well as from neighbouring countries (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2016 ).</p><p>In Malaysia, the scales of this species have been used in the belief that they cure asthma (CITES 2000) and provide protection from spirits (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). However, as above, there is evidence of heavy illicit, international trade in live animals and their scales from both Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo, largely to East Asia (Pantel and Anak 2010, Challender and Waterman 2017). In Sabah in 2016, wildlife rangers seized 25 live pangolins after they arrested a local man at a roadblock in Lahad Datu: the Sabah Wildlife Department believed these pangolins were poached from a nearby forest in Lahad Datu (New Strait Times, 2016). The Orang Asli from the Krau Wildlife Reserve in Malaysia will not consume pangolins as they believe the species is an incarnation of the human placenta, and as such, it is taboo to consume it (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). Similarly, the Orang Asli in Pos Pulat, Kelantan, and Sungai Berua, Terengganu, will burn dried pangolin scales to drive away elephants and other wild animals in the jungle (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). The Kadazans in Sabah will use dried pangolin scales to deter crocodiles while in the river (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). For the Ibans in Sarawak, the scales of the pangolin inspired the pattern called ‘tisik tenggilling’ utilised in the ketapu rotan, which is a helmet type of hat made from coarsely plaited rattan commonly used as part of the Iban cultural dress (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Around 50-100 years ago, indigenous people of Sabah (e.g. Kadazan, Dusun, Murut and Rungus) used Sunda Pangolin scales to make vests for their warriors, and for belts to cure arthritis (E. Panjang, unpubl. data). In Sabah, indigenous people who are non-Muslim consume pangolin meat, which they claim cures illnesses like asthma, and drink pangolin blood, which they regard as a tonic. However, because of the high prices offered by middle men, people frequently choose to sell pangolins rather than consume them (E. Panjang, unpubl. data)</p><p>In Indonesia, this species continues to be hunted for local, subsistence use in central and eastern Kalimantan (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013, Wirdadeti and Nash, pers. comm. 2016). Practitioners of traditional medicine in Indonesia continue to recommend pangolin scale products for heart conditions and skin disorders (H. Nash, unpubl. data). However, there is voluminous, illicit trade in the animals from Indonesia, largely from Sumatra, and primarily to China and Viet Nam (Pantel and Chin 2009, Challender and Waterman 2017). There is evidence of professional, commercial-scale hunting of the species both in Sumatra, and more widely in Indonesia, solely for the purpose of commercial but illegal international trade (Takandjiti and Sawitri 2016). While this largely involved pangolin skins prior to 2000, for the leather trade to North America (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), in the last two decades it has involved live animals, their scales and pangolin meat, and which has primarily been destined for China and Viet Nam (Sopyan 2009, Takandjiti and Sawitri 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The Sunda Pangolin is protected by legislation in virtually all its range states, being listed as a protected or totally protected which typically prohibits exploitation. There may be customary laws which permit indigenous peoples to exploit the species for subsistence purposes in some range states (e.g. Malaysia). Exceptions include Brunei Darussalam where the species is not specifically listed as protected but does receive protection under broader wildlife and forestry legislation. In China, the species is a State Category II protected species. </p>  <p>The species occurs in a number of protected areas across its range including Cambodia: Chep (Suzuki <em>et al</em>. 2017) and Pream Krasop Wildlife Sanctuaries (McCann and Pawlowski 2017), Southern Cardamom (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017a), Virachey and Botum Sakor National Parks; Thailand: Khao Yai and Kaeng Krachan National Parks (W.

123789863,2815,Bison bison,Near Threatened,C2a(i),2017,2016-09-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is listed as Near Threatened in light of its dependence on ongoing conservation program to persist beyond the next 5 years, a very limited number of viable populations (five), and large number of small (13 of 20 less than 400) isolated populations. The North America bison population underwent a drastic decline in the 19th century caused by over hunting but has since partially recovered. There has been a modest increases in the number of conservation herds and individuals in populations managed for species conservation and ecological restoration, however, all mature individuals occur within active management programs which if ceased would result in the species qualifying for a threatened status. About 97% of the continental population is managed for private captive commercial propagation; very few of these herds are managed primarily for species conservation and none is managed in the public interest for conservation. Herds managed for conservation purposes in the public interest are typically small (&lt;400), and populations are widely dispersed with few geographic situations that provide conditions for natural movements between subpopulations. The total number of mature individuals in wild free-ranging and semi-free-ranging populations is estimated to be approximately 11,248-13,123 and only 4 subpopulations have more than 1,000 individuals, thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). The species is not currently in decline but wild mature individuals could be greatly reduced if current management regimes are changed or removed. This is a conservation dependant species.<br/> <br/> The current number of ecologically restored large populations managed primarily for conservation (populations exceeding 1,000 and managed in the presence of most natural limiting factors) is small. The species is most limited in Mexico, where only one herd may remain in the wild; it is subject to adverse policies when individuals move across the international border into the United States where they are classified as livestock. Creation of opportunities for a few additional, large-scale ecological restoration projects is dependent on cooperation between government agencies and non-government organizations. Future progress in conservation and recovery of the North American bison will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by federal and state/provincial agencies, harmonization of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organizations, and public tolerance and support of wild, free-ranging bison managed as wildife on limited, large-scale landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different agencies or organizations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">The likelihood of wild bison increasing over the next five years is entirely dependent upon conservation interventions.&#160;Currently six of the 20 wild herds representing 11,956 animals (63.7%) are anchored by National Parks, Refuges or Sanctuaries. Without these large protected landscapes bison would not likely survive and the future survival of American bison would be in serious jeopardy. Beyond these 6 herds in protected areas the remaining 14 wild herds are dependent upon conservation actions and management decisions by conservation programs of States, Tribes and Provinces who regulate the populations to assure sustainability of these herds.&#160;None of the 20 wild bison herds would persist without the management prescriptions and subsequent actions of the managing authorities.&#160;Wood bison are currently protected under the Species at Risk Act and are managed under a National Recovery Strategy.&#160;Hence, wild bison (wood or plains) are totally dependent upon conservation actions and protected lands.&#160;American Bison would not persist without those intensive conservation measures.</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">North American bison are primarily grazers and forage primarily in grassland and meadow vegetative communities. They had the widest natural range of any North American herbivore, from the arid grasslands of Chihuahua State in northern Mexico, through the grasslands of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, to the riparian meadows of interior Alaska. They can persist in arid regions (e.g. Mexico and New Mexico) and in areas experiencing deep snow cover (e.g., Yellowstone National Park). Grasses and sedges form the mainstay of the annual diet in all regions. However, summer and fall diets may be broader, including flowering plants, woody plant leaves, and lichens, in addition to grasses and sedges, depending on local availability. Bison excavate snow at foraging sites by sweeping it away using side to side motions of their muzzle. The plains bison undertook seasonal migrations when they were abundant prior to European settlement of the continent. Bison no longer migrate owing to land use change contributing to range restriction and depopulation. The Wood Bison was not migratory and remains so. Both subspecies exhibit strong seasonal aggregation during the calving through breeding seasons (May through August).</p>","In the 19th Century, market, subsistence and recreational hunting nearly eliminated the bison throughout its range in North America. Conservation measures have brought about limited recovery in the wild and in captive conservation herds. Private commercial production of bison has resulted in significant numerical recovery, but does not provide for conservation of the bison as wildlife in the sense used for Red List designation. Existing threats include: habitat loss; genetic manipulation of commercial bison for market traits; small population effects in most conservation herds; few herds are exposed to a full range of natural limiting factors (natural selection); cattle gene introgression; loss of genetic non-exchangeability through hybridization between bison subspecies; and the threat of depopulation as a management response to infection of some wild populations hosting reportable cattle diseases. Canada, the United States and Mexico list bison nationally as both wildlife and domestic livestock. Legal status varies among State and Provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, four provinces and two territories classify bison as both wildlife and livestock. Bison are legally classified as livestock in the United Sates only 10 states classify bison as wildlife in all or portions of the state. An additional threat to populations of this species is culling to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.","There are approximately 31,000 total bison in 68 conservation herds (herds managed in the public interest by governments and environmental organizations) in North America. These include about 20,000 Plains Bison and 11,000 total Wood Bison. For this assessment we applied a rigorous set of criteria to classify herds as functioning as wild, functioning as wild with limitations and not functioning as wild. We excluded from this assessment 30 of 68 conservation bison herds that are very small (&lt;300) and managed on small landscapes (&lt;10,000 acres) for education, public viewing and research. Based on our criteria these bison cannot function as wild bison under current management schemes. We also did not include 9,523 bison in 18 herds managed behind fences and held in captivity, although these are important conservation herds. These herds are considered captive, intensively husbanded and culled by artificial selection.<br/><br/>There are 14,703 bison in eight herds that are in populations &gt;400 and function as wild bison subject to the full range of natural selections forces. Another 4,044 wild bison are found in 12 herds that free-range but suffer from small populations size (&lt;400) and may experience limited predation from large carnivores. For this assessment we considered the wild bison population to be 18,748 bison from these 20 free-ranging herds occupying large landscapes and primarily subjected to the forces of natural selection. We conducted Population Viability Analyses (PVA) for the eight largest herds to determine both the demographic and genetic viability of each population and their viability if they were managed as a meta-population out to 200 years (see the attached PVA report).<br/><br/>The number of calves and yearlings in a bison population will vary considerably between populations and years (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2008). Therefore It is difficult to establish the exact number of mature individuals in each of 20 bison herds but demographic data from many show that 30-40% are individuals under 2 years of age. We estimated that there are between 11,248 and 13,123 mature bison in the current populations of wild free-ranging bison in North America.<br/><br/>Populations are considered viable in the long term if they exceed 1,000 individuals (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are two Plains Bison conservation herds and two Wood Bison conservation herds each exceeding 1,000 individuals—therefore according to this criteria the total number of viable populations is only four. However, a specific population viability analysis was performed on the eight bison herds functioning as wild and results demonstrate that all are demographically viable but all but the two largest herds will lose 5-8% of their genetic diversity over the next 200 years (see the PVA report in the Supplementary Material).",Stable,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The original North American range <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">for <em>Bison bison</em> extended from northern Mexico to Alaska. Plains Bison (<em>B. b. bison</em>) occurred from Northern Mexico to central Alberta, Canada. Wood Bison (<em>B. b. athabascae</em>) occurred from central Alberta, Canada to Alaska, USA. The species' current range is restricted by land use and wildlife management policies in the southern area and by wildlife and reportable disease management policies in the northern portion of the North American range. Bison functioning as wild currently occupy less than 1.2% of their original range (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""><em> </em>2008, this report).</span></span></p>","<p>Approximately 300,000 bison are commercially propagated on 4,000 farms and ranches in North America (based on data from 2014). Conservation practices vary widely among private owners and are not regulated. Escapes from private commercial herds have been documented in Montana, Alberta, and British Columbia. Artificial selection for market traits is a cause for concern: escaped individuals may become established in the wild or interbreed with established wild populations.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">A recovery program for wood bison has existed in Canada since the early 1960s where the subspecies was designated as 'Threatened' by the Committee on Endangered Species of Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). In May 2004 COSEWIC assessed the status of plains bison and recommended listing them as 'Threatened' in Canada. National Refuges and Parks and State parks play an important role in maintaining conservation herds in Canada and the United States. Wild free-ranging herds are managed by government agencies. The Nature Conservancy manages 13 captive herds and the American Prairie Reserve manages one fenced bison herd primarily for conservation objectives. Restoration of large populations of plains bison are being considered in Alberta, southern Colorado, Arizona and northern Montana. The State of Alaska recently reintroduced wood bison to the wild in the Yukon region. Better coordination among various federal initiatives for plains bison conservation is being accomplished by a designated Department of Interior Bison Working Group commissioned by secretarial order in 2008. A Plains Bison reintroduction is scheduled for Banff National Park in spring 2017.<br/> <br/> The Bison Specialist Group (North America) produced a bison conservation assessment and action plan that provides support and guidance for policy development and conservation planning and management for public and private sector projects, including: numeric, geographic and genetic status of North American bison, including public and private herds; a review of legislation and policies of individual range states regarding bison conservation; geographic assessment of priority conservation areas in North America (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010); enhancing the capacity of members of the Bison Specialist Group and organizations they represent to provide timely, innovative and practical solutions to conservation challenges; guidelines for management in support of species’ conservation and ecological restoration. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are potential opportunities for ecological restoration of herds managed primarily for conservation on federal, state, provincial lands in some jurisdictions (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, Freese <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recently the U.S. Department of Interior published a document titled “looking forward” where they enumerated potential restoration sites in the United States (National Park Service 2014a). In addition the U.S. National Park Service has identified bison restoration as a key activity in their plan for the next 100 years. Badlands National Park is undertaking a bison range expansion within the parks boundaries that will permit increasing the population management target from 800 bison to &gt;1,000 bison.</span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There may also be opportunities for establishing herds on Native-owned lands that are managed for combined conservation and socio-economic purposes.

The Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck Reservation, Montana, also seek to host an operational quarantine facility that will provide an ongoing source of disease free culled Yellowstone bison for the purposes of conservation and cultural restoration throughout the United States.

They occur at highest densities in tropical areas, but even there are generally among the less common delphinids. The sum of existing abundance estimates is 59,157 animals, although the two largest estimates (accounting for approximately 94% of the total number) are more than 25 years old. No abundance estimates are available for a substantial part of the range of the species, and therefore total abundance is likely much higher than 60,000. Because of these whales’ low density, abundance estimates are imprecise, and thus there is no ability to assess trends in most areas.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales feed on fish species that are targeted by major high-value fisheries, including tunas and billfishes, and they regularly engage in depredation on both catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. This makes them both more vulnerable to bycatch in hook-and-line fisheries and to reductions in available prey than most species of cetaceans with similar distributions, as these other species tend to feed on small mesopelagic fish and squid or on deep-water prey such as squid.<br/><br/>The primary threats to False Killer Whales are incidental mortality (“bycatch”) in fisheries and, in some areas, directed hunting or culling. Generation length has been estimated at 25 years. Because of their life history, even low levels of bycatch or directed takes could result in population declines. Numbers taken in directed hunts in Japan have likely been great enough to reduce nearshore populations, and False Killer Whales are at least occasionally targeted in direct hunts in a few other parts of their range (Indonesia and West Indies). Bycatch is greatest in longline and other hook-and-line fisheries, but some mortality also occurs in gillnet and seine fisheries. In Hawaii, one area where they have been studied extensively, there is strong evidence of multiple subpopulations, and these have been recognized under U.S. law as separate stocks. Bycatch of the Hawaii pelagic stock in the U.S. longline fishery has been at a level thought to be high enough to limit population growth for most years since bycatch rates and abundance estimates have been available. This is a transboundary stock and foreign fleets account for the majority of longline effort in surrounding international waters, thus total bycatch levels are likely much higher than indicated by the U.S. observer program. Bycatch is known to occur in other areas but limited or no observer coverage in most fisheries and lack of abundance estimates precludes quantitative assessment of bycatch levels in relation to abundance. The only stock that has been quantitatively assessed (the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock) was estimated to have had a &gt;50% decline in abundance in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), with fishery interactions (primarily hooking and entanglement) thought to be the most important threat.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales were listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List in 2008, and the species remains data-poor for most of its range. The Red List Guidelines (Version 13, 2017) note that a taxon that comes close to qualifying for the Vulnerable (VU) category based on the Vulnerable thresholds qualifies for the Near Threatened (NT) category. This consideration combined with biological susceptibility and threat strengthens the case for a NT listing. A 30% or greater decline in three generations based on category A2(d) – a population reduction observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected, based on actual or potential levels of exploitation – qualifies a taxon for the Vulnerable category. The False Killer Whale comes close to meeting the criteria for VU for the following reasons: 1) there has been an estimated population decline of &gt;50% in two generations in the one population that has been quantitatively assessed, with the primary cause thought to be fishery interactions; 2) bycatch is a widespread threat at levels suspected to be large enough to result in population reduction throughout much of the taxon’s range, and levels of fishing effort are unlikely to decline substantially in the near future; 3) levels of directed take in some areas are likely high enough to have reduced local populations; and 4) biological susceptibility to population-level effects of bycatch exists given the life history of these whales, the overlap of their diet with the target species of high-value commercial fisheries, and their tendency to engage in depredation on catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. Given the above, False Killer Whales are therefore assessed as NT. Although the rangewide decline could be large enough for the species to qualify for VU, collecting the data necessary to quantify the extent of decline for a globally distributed, pelagic species is very difficult. Risk levels could be better assessed at the subpopulation level and efforts should be made toward that end.</p>","<p>While False Killer Whales occur in tropical, sub-tropical, and at least occasionally in warm temperate waters worldwide (Stacey <em>et al</em>. 1994, Odell and McClune 1999), their density is highest in the tropics (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). They are generally found in relatively deep, offshore waters, but individuals do approach close to shore around oceanic islands (e.g., Hawaii). Individuals from the main Hawaiian Islands resident subpopulation use both shallow (&lt;100 m) and deep (to 4,700 m) waters around the Hawaiian archipelago (Baird 2016). Some animals may move into shallow and higher latitude waters seasonally (e.g., off New Zealand; Zaeschmar 2014) or periodically (including some semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and the Mediterranean). Individuals have been documented spending extended periods of time (two to three months) in shallow water areas of the Timor and Arafura seas (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2017). Individuals and groups have been reported to enter rivers on the Chinese mainland (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995), but it was not clear whether these occurrences might have represented pre-stranding behaviour.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales eat primarily relatively large fish and cephalopods (Alonso <em>et al</em>. 1999). They have been known to attack and consume small dolphins that have been injured or disoriented when released from tuna purse seine nets, but this behavior may be more akin to learning to take advantage of opportunistic food sources than to a predilection to feed on other species of marine mammals (Baird 2018). They eat some large species of fish, such as Mahimahi (also called Dorado or Dolphinfish), Yellowfin Tuna, Skipjack Tuna, Albacore Tuna, Opah, Wahoo, pomphrets, Broadbill Swordfish and Sailfish (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Hawaiian waters observational studies suggest that large pelagic game fish (Mahimahi, tunas, billfishes) form the majority of their diet (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016). Depredation data on longline-caught fish suggest a preference for billfishes, Wahoo and tunas over Mahimahi, pomfrets, Walu, sharks or lancetfishes (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>False Killer Whales are long-lived, slow to reproduce, upper-trophic level predators, and as such are subject to effects of a number of different anthropogenic stressors. The overlap of their diet with species targeted by fisheries, in particular high-value species such as tunas and billfishes, results in a number of types of interactions that can reduce local populations, although the sparseness of observer coverage in most hook-and-line and other fisheries within the range of False Killer Whales limits the information available. In addition, the False Killer Whale is one of several species known to mass strand (Caldwell <em>et al. </em>1970, Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Liebig <em>et al.</em> 2007), with the largest known mass stranding of 835 individuals in Argentina in 1946 (Caillet-Bois 1948). Such mass strandings have the potential to affect local populations.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales are hooked in longline fisheries as they engage in depredation on both the catch and bait (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Thode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The U.S. Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery has had approximately 20% observer coverage since 2001, and has provided detailed information on bycatch rates. In this fishery, False Killer Whales are the most frequently recorded species of cetacean hooked as bycatch (Forney and Kobayashi 2005, Bradford and Forney 2014). The first abundance estimates became available for the Hawaii pelagic stock in 2003 (Barlow 2006, Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b), and documented mortality and serious injury inside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago exceeded the potential biological removal (PBR) level for 10 of the 12 years from 2003-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;2017). Rates of hooking or entanglement are approximately 1.5 individuals for every 1 million hooks set. This is a transboundary population and non-U.S. fisheries outside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago represent the majority of longline effort, thus bycatch rates for the entire Hawaii pelagic stock are likely much higher than estimated. Non-lethal but potentially significant injuries (such as those that compromise health and ability to reproduce) may also occur if animals are hooked (Baird and Gorgone 2005, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014, Alves <em>et al</em>. 2018). The rate of non-lethal line-related injuries is significantly higher in the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock than in the Hawaii pelagic stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014). The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock has only limited overlap with the longline fishery, but there are no observers in the nearshore fisheries, and thus no bycatch estimates are available. Longline fisheries occur throughout the central and western tropical Pacific, and similar interactions with False Killer Whales occur in other regions (e.g., Indian Ocean, Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010, Anderson 2014; American Samoa, Bradford and Forney 2014; Mediterranean, Bearzi 2002; western North Atlantic, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). Observers on Spanish longline vessels documented two bycaught False Killer Whales off the Azores in 2006 in approximately 810,000 observed hooks (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008), a rate similar to the Hawaii-based longline fishery. The incidental catch rate (including animals hooked but released alive) was estimated from 1992-2005 from observers in the Spanish longline fleet at 1.464, 1.685, and 0.797 individuals per million hooks for the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, respectively (Ramos-Cartelle and Mejuto 2008.) Observer programs to monitor bycatch in fisheries in most parts of the world are limited (if they exist at all), but given what is known regarding both the abundance of False Killer Whales and their predilection to take fish off lines, there is certainly potential for bycatch to result in population declines.</p>  <p>Based on observer reports, False Killer Whales were the most frequently reported species of cetacean killed in the tropical western and central Pacific purse seine fishery in 2009, with an estimated mortality of 281 (SPC-OFP 2010). Interactions with this fishery were observed within the EEZs of Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Nauru, and in international waters. Mortality of False Killer Whales has been documented in Chinese purse seine fisheries in the western Pacific (Dai <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, the only mortality documented in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery since 2001 was in 2010 (IATTC 2011).<br/><br/>Incidental takes of small numbers of False Killer Whales in gill nets have been documented off northern Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Ghana, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Japan, Republic of Korea, and China (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2014, Song 2018). Wang <em>et al</em>. (2013) noted that entanglement in large-mesh drift gillnets is likely responsible for most False Killer Whale fishery-related mortality off eastern Taiwan. Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported on cetacean bycatch rates in Chinese coastal fisheries (trawl, gill, and stow nets), which may number in the hundreds per year for False Killer Whales alone.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales have been taken in drive and harpoon fisheries in a number of areas, either for meat or oil, or to reduce populations due to real or perceived fishery conflicts. At least in some areas, the numbers taken have likely reduced local populations. False Killer Whales are occasionally taken at Saint Vincent in the Caribbean for meat and cooking oil (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Considerable numbers of False Killer Whales have also been killed in a past drive fishery in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995). Official catch records were not recorded until 1972, but from 1958 to 1960, 900 individuals were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu (Kasuya 2017). From 1972 to 2008, 2,643 were reported killed in all fishery types (including bycatch) in Japan, with the highest number in one year of 637 in 1978 (Kasuya 2017). Abundance for coastal Japan was estimated at 2,029 (Kasuya 2017), so this one-year take would have represented approximately 31% of the coastal population as estimated from 1983 to 1991. Over 1,500 were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu between 1972 and 1993, with peak mortality occurring from 1978 to 1983 when 1,358 were reportedly taken (Kasuya 2017). Smaller numbers (171) were killed in a drive fishery at Izu on the east coast of Honshu from 1978 to 1996 with 123 taken in 1978 (Kasuya 2017), and 79 were killed in a crossbow fishery in Okinawa between 1993 and 2011 (Kasuya 2017). False Killer Whales have also been killed in the drive fishery at Taiji on the west coast of Honshu, with 586 killed between 1982 and 2011 and up to 91 killed in a single year (Kasuya 2017). Quotas are in place in Japan for drive and crossbow fisheries although those quotas have only rarely been reached in recent years (Kasuya 2017). Some of the animals caught in the Japanese and Taiwanese drive fisheries have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Deliberate shooting in response to depredation may also occur in a number of areas. Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted, for example, that in Hawaii fishermen have reported shooting at False Killer Whales or other dolphins in response to depredation. Anderson (2014) noted that False Killer Whales are likely being shot by tuna longline fishermen in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although there is considerable controversy regarding the absolute extent of declines, there is good evidence of large-scale reductions in many predatory fish populations (e.g., Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Sibert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Polacheck 2006), including Yellowfin and Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2009; Langley <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition to overfishing, expansion in the extent of unproductive areas and other ecosystem changes (e.g., Polovina <em>et al</em>. 2008, Coll <em>et al</em>. 2008, Koslow <em>et al.</em> 2015) have the potential to influence fish populations at multiple trophic levels. The effects of such reductions of fish populations and subsequent ecosystem changes on populations of False Killer Whales worldwide are unknown but could have resulted in population declines.<br/><br/>Studies of persistent organic pollutants in the main Hawaiian Islands insular population have revealed that all adult males and a number of adult females sampled from the population have levels of PCBs that exceed thresholds thought to cause immunosuppression (Ylitalo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Foltz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicates that they have swallowed discarded plastic items, which may eventually lead to death (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001); False Killer Whales may also be at risk from this threat.</p><p></p>","<p>Density of False Killer Whales is highest in low latitudes; in the eastern North Pacific, for example, density drops by an order of magnitude north of approximately 15°N (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). Abundance estimates are available for a number of areas, and in general False Killer Whales are among the least abundant delphinids even in their highest density areas (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Ballance and Pitman 1998). In the eastern tropical Pacific, in an area of 19.1 million km², False Killer Whale abundance was estimated as 38,900 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.64) based on line-transect surveys from 1986-1991 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). In the western North Pacific, in an area of 2.9 million km², abundance was estimated as 16,668 (CV 0.26) based on line-transect surveys from 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Kasuya (2017) subdivided this estimate based on region, and noted for coastal Japan (30°-42°N and west of 145°E) the abundance was estimated as 2,029 (95% confidence interval (CI) 907-4,541). In the Gulf of Mexico, there are three False Killer Whale abundance estimates based on line-transect surveys: 381 (CV 0.62) for 1991-1994, 1,038 (CV 0.71) for 1996-2001, and 777 (CV 0.56) for 2003-2004 (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). For U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic, abundance was estimated as 442 (CV 1.06) based on a survey in 2011 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the western Indian Ocean, the False Killer Whale ranked 11th out of 13 species of delphinids in relative abundance (Ballance and Pitman 1998), based on a line-transect survey in 1995. Abundance off New Zealand was estimated as 111 individuals based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identification data collected during 2005-2012 (Zaeschmar 2014).<br/><br/>The only region where abundance estimates have been apportioned by stock is within the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago. The abundance estimate for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identified animals was 167 individuals (standard error 23) in 2015 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). This is the only population where trend information is available, and several lines of evidence suggest that abundance in the 1980s was much higher, likely in the 400-700 range (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2009, Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), which would indicate a substantial long-term decline. More recent trend (i.e., 2000s through 2015) is unknown due to the variability associated with recent abundance estimates (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). Abundance of the insular stock in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, in an area of 0.4 million km², was estimated as 552 individuals (CV 1.09) based on a line-transect survey in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The abundance of the pelagic stock within the entire U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago (an area of 2.3 million km²) was estimated as 1,540 individuals (CV 0.66) based on a 2010 line-transect survey although vessel attraction was not accounted for and this therefore may have led to overestimation of abundance (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Although no abundance estimate was given, Anderson (2014) noted that the numbers of False Killer Whales around the Maldives had decreased over a 20-year period and that it may have been due to interactions with longline fisheries in the area.<br/><br/>The generation length for False Killer Whales was estimated at 25 years by Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010), thus three generations is 75 years. The only subpopulation with sufficient evidence to assess trends over more than one generation is the main Hawaiian Island insular population, where there is evidence of a greater than 50% decline in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>",Unknown,"False Killer Whales are found in tropical to warm temperate zones, generally in relatively deep, offshore waters in all three major oceans. Densities are much higher in tropical regions and movements into higher latitudes may be associated with warmer currents, or they could be seasonal (Zaeschmar 2014). False Killer Whales do not generally range into latitudes higher than 50° in either hemisphere. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas and bays, including the Sea of Japan, Bohai/Yellow Sea, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, but they are observed only occasionally in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017, Baldwin <em>et al</em> 1999, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1989). There are a few records for the Baltic Sea, which are considered extralimital (Aguayo 1978).","<p>False Killer Whales are taken in hand-harpoon and drive hunts as well as small-type whaling (with a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size limit) in Japan (Kishiro and Kasuya 1993, Kasuya 2017). They are also hunted at least opportunistically in Indonesia (Barnes 1991) and the West Indies (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Quotas remain for takes of False Killer Whale in drive fisheries and hand-harpoon fisheries in Japan (Kasuya 2017). Although there is no legal hunting of False Killer Whales in the Republic of Korea, meat from False Killer Whales has been represented in markets at significantly higher rates than expected based on reports of bycaught animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006). Based on their analysis, Baker <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggested that the False Killer Whales must be killed at a rate 10-times greater than the reported bycatch.<br/><br/>Some of the animals caught in the drive hunt or bycaught in Japan have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984) and a few were live-captured in California and Hawaii as recently as the 1970s (Reeves and Leatherwood 1984).</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p>The False Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).<br/><br/>The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (subpopulation) was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2012. A number of “biologically important areas” have been recognized for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2015). Critical habitat for this stock was designated in 2018 as part of a settlement from a lawsuit. Both the Hawaiian pelagic stock and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock are subjects of a False Killer Whale Take Reduction Plan as required by the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act that went into effect in 2013, in an attempt to reduce bycatch in the Hawaii-based longline fisheries to a level below its calculated potential biological removal. The Take Reduction Plan includes both gear changes (mandating “weak” circle hooks with a maximum wire diameter of 4.5 mm and “strong” branchlines, with a minimum diameter of 2.0 mm) as well as handling guidelines to try to allow hooks to straighten, releasing animals from the gear. In addition, prior to the Take Reduction Plan the longline exclusion area around the main Hawaiian Islands would seasonally contract towards the islands for four months of the year, but the Take Reduction Plan removed that seasonal shift, thus reducing overlap between the longline fishery and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock. Overall however, as of April 2018, serious injury and mortality rates in the Hawaii-based longline fishery (with the vast majority from the Hawaii pelagic stock of False Killer Whales) had not declined.</p><p></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

While Black Rhino numbers have more than doubled since bottoming out in the mid 1990s (due to increased protection and enhanced biological management to keep more subpopulations productive), the species qualifies as CR due to the scale of the decline in numbers over the past three generations as a result of very heavy poaching in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Three generations ago (i.e., 44 years back in 1973) the point estimate for Black Rhinos was 37,807 rhinos and despite numbers more than doubling from a low of 2,354 were only 5,495 as of end 2017. This represents a decline over three generations of 85% qualifying as CR under criterion A2. An 83% reduction was projected one year (based on data up to and including 2017) into the future (from 1974–2018). This reduction was the same as observed in point estimates for these dates. The next worse projected reduction in point estimates over three generations was when modelling two years ahead from 1975–2019 (an 81% reduction from an estimated 28,674 in 1975). Numbers continue to increase at a continental-level although at a reduced rate due to the escalation of poaching since 2007.</p>","Black Rhino occur in a wide variety of habitats from desert areas in Namibia to wetter wooded areas. The highest densities of rhinos are found in savannas on nutrient-rich soils and in succulent Valley Bushveld areas. Black Rhino are browsers and favour small acacia's and other palatable woody species (<em>Grewia</em>'s<span style=""font-style: italic;"">,</span> Euphorbiaceae species, etc.) as well as palatable herbs and succulents. However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities). Surplus rhino that are removed from such established populations are routinely being profitably invested in new areas with suitable habitat and protection where populations can grow rapidly.","<p>Black Rhino face a variety of threats. The main threat to the species is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary&#160;Information&#160;file.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also reduce conservation budgets and incentives to conserve Black Rhino privately (both those privately owned and those managed for the state on a custodianship basis (due to declining live sales and greatly increased protection costs ). For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019 <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout most of the 20th century, the Black Rhino was the most numerous of the world's rhino species. Relentless hunting of the species and clearances of land for settlement and agriculture reduced numbers and by 1960 only an estimated 100,000 remained. Between 1960 and 1995, large-scale poaching caused a dramatic 98% collapse in numbers with numbers bottoming out in the mid 1990s. Over this period numbers only increased in South Africa and Namibia (Emslie and Brooks 1999). From 1992–1997 total numbers remained relatively stable with increases in some countries (those with the best-protected and managed populations) being cancelled out by declines in others. However, since the lows of the mid-1990s, Black Rhino numbers at a continental level have more than doubled reaching and estimated 5,495 by end 2017 (Emslie&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2019) and 5,630 by end 2018 (Knight 2019).

The repatriation of some of these animals back to four areas of former subspecies range in Tanzania commenced in 1997, with animals also subsequently going to found a subpopulation in Rwanda.<br/><br/><em>Diceros b. minor</em> is believed to have occurred from southern Tanzania through Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to the northern, northwestern and northeastern parts of South Africa (north of the Mtamvuna River). It also probably occurred in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Angola, eastern Botswana, Malawi, and Eswatini. Today, its stronghold is South Africa and to a lesser extent Zimbabwe, with smaller numbers remaining in southern Tanzania. The South-central Black Rhino is now thought to be extinct in Angola and only one individual has been sighted in Mozambique since the 2008 IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) meeting. The subspecies has also been reintroduced to Botswana, Malawi, Eswatini and Zambia. Based on very small sample sizes, Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2017) results suggested that perhaps the original historical Black Rhino&#160;that used to occur in Zambia but which had been wiped out by poaching by 1995 might be better classified as&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli </em>rather than&#160;<em>D.b.mino</em>r. However, on account of the small sample sizes, and given that the species was reintroduced with&#160;<em>D. b. minor&#160;</em>founders, and that historically Zambia had been considered&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range, and climate and habitats are more similar to some&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range; reviewers recommended that historical pre-1995 Zambian animals should continue to be allocated to&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;for this Red List revision (as has historically been the case). With further data this may change in future. As there were still significant numbers of Black Rhinos in Zambia in the early 1970s, how these animals are allocated influences the&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;subspecies Red List assessment which would change to Endangered under criteria A2 and A4. The <em>D. b. michaeli</em> assessment remains the same whether or not the historical animals are classified as <em>D. b. minor</em> or&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli</em>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries,  the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not  releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts  and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons. For this  reason, only whole countries of occurrence are indicated on the range  maps produced by the AfRSG.</p>","Limited hunting of specific individual surplus Black Rhino males to further demographic and genetic metapopulation goals was only recently sanctioned by CITES.  Black Rhinos, however, are currently only openly sold in South Africa and in all other Range States Black Rhino on communal or private land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state.  Black Rhinos are primarily threatened by illegal killing for horn.<br/><br/>Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat with the occasional zoo animal being reintroduced.",Terrestrial,"Black Rhino have been listed on CITES Appendix I since 1977. All international commercial trade in Black Rhinos and their products have been prohibited. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of consumer states. Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new populations both within and outside the species' former range. Following a decline in breeding performance in some areas, increased effort has recently been given to improving biological management with a view to increasing metapopulation growth rates. Increasing efforts are also being made to integrate local communities into conservation efforts (most notably in the Kunene region of Namibia). Strategically, Black Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long term security. In contrast to Southern White Rhino, most Black Rhino on privately owned land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state. Since CITES CoP13 limited sport hunting quotas have been approved for the two Range States with biggest populations (South Africa and Namibia). Removal of specific individuals can enhance demographic and/or genetic conservation. In addition to local and, national initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the SADC Rhino Management Group, the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group and the East African Community Rhino Management Group. In addition to National Rhino Plans there is a Continental African Rhino Range States Conservation Plan.

160755590,7960,Equus zebra,Vulnerable,A3bcd,2019,2018-04-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The global population of Mountain Zebra (<em>Equus zebra</em>) is estimated at 34,979 mature individuals (based on 55% to 75% mature). The majority of these are the subspecies Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra (<em>E. z. hartmannae</em>; about 33,265 mature individuals), with much fewer of the Cape Mountain Zebra subspecies (<em>E. z. zebra</em>; at least 1,714 mature individuals). The Cape Mountain Zebra has recovered from a nadir of 80 individuals in the 1950s with a steady population growth rate of 8-10% over the past three generations, leading to this subspecies recently being listed as Least Concern (Hrabar <em>et al.</em> 2015). While Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra is currently numerous, it has also recovered from a severe population reduction in the 1980s due to the effects of drought. The likelihood of increased drought frequency under climate projections, including the present four year drought, led to this subspecies recently being listed as VU A3bcd (Gosling <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>As about 95% of the global population of Mountain Zebra consists of the Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra subspecies, the listing of the species as a whole should follow the Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra listing: VU A3bcd, due to the probability of a future population reduction of at least 30% when further severe droughts occur.","Mountain Zebra inhabit rugged, broken mountainous and escarpment areas up to around 2,000 m with a rich diversity of grass species and perennial water sources. Mountain zebra are specialist grazers and browse only when forced to do so (Penzhorn 2013). Like most equids they are bulk, roughage feeders and so need to consume large daily quantities. They show seasonal movements with some individuals moving between summer and winter ranges and others staying in the same area. At the start of the annual summer rains, usually in November or December, mountain zebra sometimes move in large numbers to lower altitude green flushes (e.g., Joubert 1972). A physiological study suggest that their digestive efficiency and water requirements are similar to those of horses (Joubert and Louw 1976). Grobler (1983) showed that Cape Mountain Zebra are specialist grazers that select only a subset of the grass species available and that they prefer to feed at higher levels in the sward, sometimes selecting seed heads. Penzhorn (1982) reported that Cape Mountain Zebra make use of dwarf shrub foliage in the winter months but this was not seen by Grobler in the Mountain Zebra National Park. There are no studies of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra comparable to those on Cape Mountain Zebra. Gosling (pers ob) observed Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra browsing the leaves of <em>Catophractes alexandri </em>in Etosha NP even though grass was available nearby.<br/><br/>The typical social structure of Mountain Zebra is one of small harems comprising an adult stallion and one to three mares and their dependent foals and juvenile offspring; non-breeding groups consist primarily of bachelors, but sometimes include young fillies (Penzhorn 2013).<br/><br/>Movements between spatially separate ranges in different seasons have been recorded in some areas in Namibia, and in others seasonal movements without a clear separation of seasonal ranges have been seen. The fact that some animals move long distances to separate ranges under particular ecological circumstances means that Mountain Zebra should be regarded as a migratory species. Due to fences and other restrictions animals are not always free to migrate, however.<br/><br/>See the subspecies Red List assessments for more details on Habitats and Ecology.","Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra remains at risk of catastrophic decline under future droughts, as experienced in the early 1980s. The effects of drought and extreme weather on small populations has been documented for Przewalski's horses (<em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>) in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), and is currently affecting Grevy's Zebra (<em>E. grevyi</em>) in Kenya (B. Low-MacKaye, pers. comm. 2017). Increasingly sophisticated farming could further disrupt movements through fencing or by preventing access to surface water (Novellie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002).<br/><br/>The greatest current threat to Cape Mountain Zebra is further loss of genetic diversity through inbreeding, caused by small subpopulation sizes and/or small property sizes. New subpopulations have been created through translocation of animals, with all but one of these subpopulations originating from Mountain Zebra National Park (MZNP); the exception being De Hoop Nature Reserve, which consists of individuals from MZNP and Kammanassie Nature Reserve. Two thirds of the entire genotype is therefore located in just two populations (Kammanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserve (Moodley and Harley 2005)), while the remaining third comprises MZNP and reintroduced populations. Currently, the South African population of Cape Mountain Zebra is highly fragmented into a large number of small subpopulations yet little metapopulation management is practiced. Founder groups are often small (50% of subpopulations have had a founder population smaller than the recommended 14 animals, Hrabar and Kerley 2015), and genetic exchange between subpopulations is poor (73% of privately-owned subpopulations have only ever had a single introduction event, Hrabar and Kerley 2015), thereby increasing the risk of inbreeding and genetic drift. Vulnerability to disease also increases due to inbreeding. The subpopulations at both Bontebok National Park and Gariep Dam Nature Reserve, which have been shown to be inbred and lack genetic diversity, have both had an outbreak of sarcoid tumours (53% and 22% of the subpopulations, respectively), indicating a general immune system breakdown (Sasidharan 2006, Sasidharan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Development of a metapopulation management plan (and adoption of such plan into provincial and national conservation policy) which incorporates “resource mobilization strategies” (how human and financial resources will be utilized for successful implementation of the plan) is essential in ensuring the long-term survival of Cape Mountain Zebra.<br/><br/>Cape Mountain Zebra were once extensively hunted for their skins, because they competed with livestock for grazing, and allegedly because they broke fences (Penzhorn 1988). Today, however, the greatest threat to the Cape subspecies may stem from the risk of hybridization with Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra and Plains Zebra (Dalton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Hybridisation risk also exists for Hartmann’s Mountain zebra: possible hybridisation between mountain zebra and plains zebra (<em>E. quagga burchelli</em>) have been reported for some years in the Otjovasandu area of Etsoha NP where the two species overlap. Recent analysis of faecal DNA (Pauline Kamath pers. comm.) using microsatellite markers in samples of 21 of each species from Otjovasandu supports both hybridization and introgression. However, we do not know it this is part of a normal hybrid zone or if it is an artifact, perhaps caused by the boundary fence artificially keeping the two species in closer contact throughout the year than would be the case if mountain zebra were free to move westward. Hybridisation is also reported between the HMZ and donkeys in Angola (P. vaz Pinto unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In Namibia, there is commercial trade in Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra skins. Populations need to be carefully monitored so that harvesting does not adversely affect population viability. However, economical incentives provided through sustainable hunting also help improve prospects of coexistence with cattle farmers who occupy much of the range. Hartmann's Mountain Zebra are reportedly being harvested at a rate of about 2,000-3,000 per year, which may exceed their rate of population growth (e.g., Cape Mountain Zebra in Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve increase at about 5% per year; Watson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>A poorly understood, but emerging, threat is that of reintroduced large predators into areas containing subpopulations of Cape Mountain Zebra. This includes Lion (Addo Elephant, Mountain Zebra and Karoo national parks) and Cheetah (MZNP, some private reserves). Data indicate that Cape Mountain Zebra were preferred prey for Lion in Karoo National Park (C. Tambling unpubl. data), and anecdotal evidence suggests that cheetah suppressed population growth in at least one privately-owned population. Further research is needed to assess the extent and implications of this threat.","Mountain zebras were once widespread and numerous. In the 20<sup>th </sup>century both subspecies underwent dramatic declines, but subsequently populations have increased. See the subspecies Red List Assessments for more details on populations.<br/><br/><strong>SOUTH AFRICA</strong><br/>Hunting and habitat loss to agriculture reduced the Cape Mountain Zebra to just 80 individuals remaining in three relict populations in the 1950s (Bigalke 1952, Millar 1970). In 1998, the number of Cape Mountain Zebras had increased to about 1,200 individuals, with the largest population (reintroduced in the Karoo National Park), estimated to number 250 (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). From 1985 to 1995 the annual rate of increase was reported as 8.6 % (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996), 9.6 % between 1995 and 1998 (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002), 8.33 % between 2002 and 2009 (Hrabar and Kerley 2013) and 9.16% between 2009-2015 (Hrabar and Kerley 2015). However, estimating annual growth rate trends is challenging because most subpopulations are actively managed (maintained at sustainable stocking levels) and animals are often removed or augmented, which masks true growth rate.<br/><br/>Currently (2014/15), there are estimated to be between 1,714 and 3,247 mature individuals of Cape Mountain Zebra (using a 55% and 75% mature population structure respectively). In formally protected areas alone, there are an observed 1,714–2,338 mature individuals. A survey of animals on both formally protected and private properties found that the total population has grown to over 4,790 animals in 75 subpopulations (Hrabar and Kerley 2015). Fifty six populations (1,487 individuals) are on privately owned land and 19 are on formally protected areas (3,304 individuals). The majority of the population (69%) remains on formally protected land and the proportion on privately-owned land (31%) has not risen since 2009, despite the increase in subpopulation number. The MZNP and Karoo NP subpopulations continue to make up a significant proportion of the population, namely 25% and 18%, respectively.<br/><br/>The total formally protected population of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in 2004 was 80 individuals, increasing to 277 in Goegap Nature Reserve (M. Smit unpubl. data 2015) and Augrabies Falls National Park (Bissett <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>, 2016), plus an unknown number of animals in Richtersveld National Park. It is estimated that there are currently at least 570 Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra on private land in the Northern Cape (M. Smit, unpubl. Data, 2009-2013; A. Taylor, unpubl. data, 2014). A preliminary analysis to determine which private subpopulations can be considered wild, revealed that 64–95% of individuals on private land are eligible for inclusion in the assessment (N = 21 properties, A. Taylor, unpubl. data), which means 364-542 privately owned Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra are eligible for inclusion in this assessment. Private subpopulations are inferred to be increasing along with the expansion of the wildlife ranching industry. Overall the total mature and wild population size of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in South Africa, based on available data, is at least 592–724 (based on 75% mature). <br/><br/>There are therefore a total of 2,306-3,971 mature Mountain Zebra in South Africa, with an increasing population. However about 30% of Cape Mountain Zebra, and 25% of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra are located on private land, and the Mountain Zebras on protected areas are isolated.<br/><br/><strong>NAMIBIA</strong><br/>In 1998, the Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra population was estimated to number about 25,000, or approximately 8,300 mature individuals (Novellie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002) in Namibia. Limited data in 2008 indicated that populations were increasing on communal lands in the north-western part of the country (G. Stuart-Hill pers. comm. 2008): from 2000 to 2006 numbers increased from 6 to 27 individuals observed per 100 km of road surveyed. Nearly a decade of above-average rainfall was likely driving this increase. The national total of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in Namibia is currently estimated at 44,712 with an average density of 0.45 per km² (Gosling <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2018), although there has been a decline . This is certainly an underestimate because inadequate sampling precludes proper estimation of the numbers on private farms and freehold conservancies. Using the criterion of physiological maturity, rather than that of behavioral breeding status, the total number of mature individuals in Namibia is 32,416 mature individuals (72.5 % of 44,712). It should be noted that there has been a massive decline in zebras over the last 2-3 years due to the current drought (J. Muntifering Pers comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>ANGOLA</strong><br/>A recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Namibia in Iona National Park (Kolberg and Killian 2003) found an estimated subpopulation size of 263, or 191 mature Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra.<br/><br/><strong>GLOBAL POPULATION<br/></strong>Based on recent survey data, global population size of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra is about 33,265 (191 mature individuals in Angola, 592-724 in South Africa, and 32,416 in Namibia), with at least 1,714 Cape Mountain Zebra (in South Africa), resulting in a total global population of 34,979 mature Mountain Zebra.",Increasing,"The Mountain Zebra (<em>Equus zebra</em>) is currently found in South Africa, Namibia, and Angola. The Cape Mountain Zebra (<span><em>E. z. zebra</em>) is endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, while Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra (<span><span><em>Equus zebra hartmannae</em>)</span> is found mainly in Namibia, with small populations in Angola and South Africa. It is postulated that in historical times the two subspecies were separated by an area devoid of mountainous habitat, the Knersvlakte, which separates the Kamiesberg in the north from the Roggeveldberge in the south (Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). However there are no historical (pre-1920) records of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra south of the Orange River (Skead 2011).<br/><br/>Cape Mountain Zebra's historical distribution extended throughout the great escarpment range in the Cape, south of the Orange River, including the Cape Fold Belt Mountains (the southern parts of the current eastern Western Cape Province), and the southern extent of the Northern Cape province. Thus, although once widely distributed throughout the mountainous regions of the Cape, over-hunting and agricultural expansion reduced the population to fewer than 80 individuals located in just five areas of the former Cape province by the 1950s (Millar 1970). Only three remnant subpopulations from the former natural distribution survived: Mountain Zebra National Park, Kammanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserves (Smith <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>The current distribution of Cape Mountain Zebra is limited to (at least) 75 fenced and isolated subpopulations spread throughout the former range. Subpopulations have been reintroduced to, amongst others, Karoo, Addo Elephant, Bontebok, Tankwa Karoo and Camdeboo national parks, De Hoop Nature Reserve, Commando Drift Nature Reserve, Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area and Tsolwana Nature Reserve (Hrabar and Kerley 2015). Two of these reserve populations (Commando Drift and Tsolwana) are possibly extralimital, as there are no historical records of the species east of the Great Fish River (Skead 2007). The subpopulation at Gariep Dam Nature Reserve in the Free State Province is significantly extra-limital (Boshoff and Kerley 2013) and not included in this assessment. Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) regarded the West Coast National Park as being within the historical range but there is some doubt about this given that it is on the coast and 70 km from the closest historically-recorded subpopulation in Picketburg (Skead 2011). The issue of whether to include West Coast National Park to be within the subspecies’ range has not been resolved. The subpopulation at Oorlogskloof Nature Reserve in the Northern Cape lies in a historical range of Cape Mountain Zebra.<br/><br/>Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra primarily occupy the escarpment region of western Namibia that runs north-south along the entire length of the country and which form the boundary between an arid coastal plain (which includes the Namib Desert in the south and the Skeleton Coast in the north) and a wetter inland plateau. The current range of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra differs from the historical range in Namibia, partly because of the widespread establishment of artificial water sources which allow this water-dependent sub-species to occupy habitat that was previously unsuitable (Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/>Published accounts of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra distribution (Joubert 1973, Penzhorn 2013) refer to four subpopulations: (1) from Kunene Region southwards to the Ugab River and eastward to the Outjo District; (2) the Erongo Mountains; (3) the escarpment from the Swakop River southwards to the Naukluft Mountains and eastward along the Kuiseb and Gaub drainages into the Khomas Hochland; and (4) the Fish River canyon and Huns Mountains near the Orange River in the south.&#160; There is some evidence for these distinctions in the distribution map in Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002). However current information suggests that the three northern ‘subpopulations’ are essentially continuous. This may be due to significant population expansion or from under-sampling in some areas (especially where there are low levels of commercial farm questionnaire returns). The extent to which the Hunsberg/Fish River sub-population in the south is separated needs further investigation.<br/><br/>At the southern end of its distribution Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra extends into northern South Africa and are found in three conservation areas: Richtersveld and Augrabies National Parks and Goegap Provincial Nature Reserve (Novellie <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). They have also been introduced outside of their natural distribution range in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, North West and Free State provinces. At its northern end, the sub-species distribution extends into southern Angola and 263 were estimated in the Iona National Park in a 2003 survey (Kolberg and Kilian 2003).","Consumptive utilization of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra in Namibia is allowed through appropriate regulations and a permit system. Permits issued by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism are required for any form of consumptive use in Namibia. The permit system aims to ensure that Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra utilization is sustainable and has no detrimental effect on the long-term survival of the species. ‘Shoot and sell’, trophy hunting and ‘keep and sell’ (live capture) are the different forms of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra utilization currently permitted in Namibia. The number of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra shot as trophies was 1,820 in 2008 and 1,064 in 2009 (van Schalkwyk <em>et al.</em> 2010). The mean number of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra harvested per annum in Namibia (2008–2012) was 3,538 (Shapi 2014), which is not predicted to impact population growth negatively. The number of Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra killed illegally is not known however 6.2% of freehold farms reported losses over one recent year due to poaching (Lindsey 2011). No export of live animals from Namibia is allowed.<br/><br/>Cape Mountain Zebra are mostly traded as live animals on game auctions. The overall aim of harvesting on formally protected areas at present is population management but also to increase the national metapopulation. Overall, the offtake number is lower than the rate of population increase. No hunting takes place in any provincial or national parks where the species occurs, although translocations are used as a tool to manage subpopulation sizes. Illegal translocations and poaching occurs on a limited scale. Some poaching for bushmeat occurs in at least one subpopulation (Camdeboo National Park). Cases of Cape Mountain Zebra being hunted and sold or exported as Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra have also been reported. The CITES hunting quota is zero and thus there is no international trade.",Terrestrial,"Formally protected areas, and areas of good habitat (Lea <em><em>et al.</em></em> 206), are crucial for the conservation of Mountain Zebra, particularly in South Africa. Since Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra need to move flexibly over very large distances in response to spatial and temporal variation in rainfall and primary production, very large areas that are connected and support suitable habitat are needed if viable populations are to survive. <br/><br/>For details on specific conservation actions needed for the two subspecies see their Red List accounts. In summary, crucial actions needed for Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra include better surveys of population numbers, a regional perspective to land use planning, research on zebra ecology, hybridization and human-zebra relationships. For Cape Mountain Zebra key conservation actions are development and implementation of a metapopulation management strategy and a biodiversity management plan (also see Novellie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
160756767,6909,Dugong dugon,Vulnerable,A2bcd+4bcd,2019,2015-07-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) made a crude estimate of the Dugong’s extent of occurrence (EOO) as 860,000 km<sup>2</sup> based on potential habitat (waters &lt;10 m deep in its known range). This spans approximately 128,000 km of coastline across at least 37, and up to 44, countries and territories. Although the Dugong still occurs at the extremes of its range, Husar (1978) and IUCN (2009) list the Dugong as extinct in the waters of several islands including: the Maldives, the Lakshadweep Islands, Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues, and Taiwan (Husar 1978). Although this species may only have been vagrant at some of these islands (e.g. Taiwan, Hirasaka 1932), there is historical evidence of substantial Dugong populations off Mauritius and Rodrigues Islands; these populations were harvested in the 18th century (Cheke 1987). Cheke quotes historical accounts of a dugong fishery on Rodrigues in the 1730s. There is also anecdotal evidence that the area of occupancy (AOO) of the Dugong has declined in many parts of its range, especially along the coasts of east Africa and India. <br/><br/>The only reference site is the urban coast of Queensland between Cooktown and Brisbane, Australia where a 40 year time series of catch rates in nets set for bather protection indicates that the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) in 1999 was only 3% of that in 1962 (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2005). This CPUE is considered an index of Dugong decline in the region from all causes during this period. This decline and modern aerial survey estimates of Dugong abundance were used to backcast the population in the region in the early 1960s (which would be expected to have been lower than that at the time of European settlement as a cottage commercial industry for Dugong oil had existed at several locations along this coast since the 1850s). The extrapolation suggested that the region supported 72,000 (95% CI 31,000, 165,000) Dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4,220 (95% CI 2,360, 8,360) Dugongs in the mid 1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72,000 Dugongs, a result which suggests that the habitat had also declined or that the shark net CPUE has overestimated the decline (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2005). If the magnitude of this decline was robust and typical of the entire range of the Dugong, the Dugong would qualify for being classified as Critically Endangered at a global scale. However, there are sites in Australia that support large populations of Dugongs (e.g. Shark Bay, Torres Strait) where it is unlikely that such a decline has occurred (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). <br/><br/>The major causes of the Dugong’s decline along the urban coast of Queensland are still present in most of the Dugong’s range as follows: gill netting, subsistence hunting, habitat loss from extreme weather events that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, human settlement and agricultural pollution. The magnitude of these threats is likely to be greater in most other parts of the Dugong’s range than in Queensland. The Queensland coast supports a low human population density relative to most other parts of the Dugong’s range and has a well- developed system of marine parks and pro-active management. Nonetheless there is evidence of ongoing decline in Dugong numbers (Sobtzick <em>et al</em>. 2012) along the urban coast of the Great Barrier Reef Region largely attributed to habitat loss associated with extreme weather events. <br/><br/>Marsh <em>et al. </em>(2011) undertook a regional assessment of the Dugong and concluded that the East African population was likely ‘Endangered’; Red Sea and Gulf of Aden ‘Data Deficient’; Arabians Gulf ‘Data Deficient’; Indian sub-continent and Andaman and Nicobar Islands ‘Endangered’; continental South East Asia ‘Endangered’; archipelagic East and South East Asia ‘Data Deficient’; Western Pacific Islands ‘Data Deficient’; and Palau and the Japan (Ryukyus) as Critically Endangered. The most recent assessment of the Australian population (Woinarski <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014) concluded it was ‘Near Threatened’. The Dugong’s confirmed range states include a mix of developing and developed countries and territories including countries and territories with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), countries with a high HDI, countries with a medium HDI and three countries with a low HDI (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). The outlook for Dugongs in countries with a very small Dugong population and/or a low HDI must be poor. These countries include Brunei, Cambodia, China, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, Mozambique, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Yemen. Nonetheless, four countries/territories with a very high HDI (Australia, New Caledonia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) support substantial populations of Dugongs (hundreds or thousands; Marsh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), although even among and within these countries/territories the prospects are uneven. Because of the uncertainty associated with the assessment of the status of the Dugong, we suggest that the classification should remain as Vulnerable.","Habitat requirements for Dugongs include coastal areas, shallow to medium deep, warm waters (15-17°C minimum with behavioural thermoregulation), seagrass beds supporting sub-tropical and tropical species of seagrass, particularly low fiber species (Hines <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Dugongs show great variability in movement patterns and migration, depending on the study area and the influence of seasonal temperature or rainfall on regional ecosystems. Long-distance movements by Dugongs along the Queensland coast are well-documented (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2006), even though Dugongs do not appear to undertake regular migrations and individual movements are individualistic (Sheppard <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Gredzens <em>et al. </em>2014). Cope <em>et al. </em>(2015) used pedigree analysis based on individual genetic markers to infer the movements of Dugongs between locations in southeast Queensland including Moreton Bay and Hervey Bay. They found that approximately 30% of assigned parents had at least one offspring found in a different locality, implying recent movement of the parent or offspring. This analysis suggested markedly more movement between localities than detected through repeated direct sampling of individuals (Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2014) or through telemetry (Sheppard <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).","Threats to Dugongs vary between different populations as detailed in Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) and Hines <em>et al.</em> (2012).&#160;Major threats include:<ul><li>Incidental capture in fishing gear (e.g. gill nets), shark nets for bather protection, IUU fishing especially if meat is subsequently sold (see Pilcher <em>et al. </em>2014, for a detailed rapid assessment based on questionnaires to provide information on conservation hotpots for Dugongs in 18 countries in four geographic areas: Pacific, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Africa, with 6,153 respondents)</li><li>Hunting: legal (i.e. culturally sanctioned) and illegal</li><li>Boat strikes and boating activities (e.g. acoustic pollution)</li><li>Damage/modification/loss of habitat caused by human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling destructive fishing, natural processes (e.g. cyclones and tsunamis)</li><li>Threats to seagrass (including untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging and reclamation, inshore commercial trawling, agricultural pollution)</li><li>Chemical pollution (e.g. oil spills and heavy metal loads)</li><li>Climate change (extreme weather events and high temperatures)</li></ul>The major drivers for incidental capture in fishing gear and illegal hunting are poverty and declining fish stocks. Dugongs are legally protected in most of their range. However, enforcement is typically weak or non-existent. The imperative of artisanal fishers to break the law is increased by the opportunity to sell both Dugong meat (Robards and Reeves 2011) and valuable commodities such as swim bladders and shark fins (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011). Artisanal coastal and riverine fisheries are vital to the livelihoods and food security of coastal peoples, especially in the tropics (Batista <em>et al. </em>2014), including most Dugong range states. On a global scale, such fisheries catch the same amount of fish for human consumption as commercial fisheries, yet employ some 25 times the number of fishers (over 12 million people; Chuenpagdee <em>et al.</em> 2008, Batista <em>et al.</em> 2014). Gill nets are significant threat to many marine mammals including dugongs (Read <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2010, Pilcher <em>et al.</em> 2014). Some Dugong declines coincide with the introduction of monofilament nylon gill nets (Muir and Kizka 2012). However, it is often very difficult to convince the fishers or the fisheries managers to take the capture of Dugongs seriously. When Dugong population sizes are low, their capture in fisheries is a rare event, which becomes rarer as the Dugong population declines. Coastal development represents another important driver. Significant seagrass loss leads to Dugongs having reduced food resources, delayed reproduction and starvation (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The impact of chemical and noise pollution on Dugongs is unquantified. (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>Climate change is projected to lead to altered coastal environmental condition and increases in severe tropical storms and flood events that could affect both Dugongs and their seagrass habitats exacerbating the effects of the other drivers listed above (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011 for details).","Five countries/territories (Australia, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and the United Arabian Emirates) support substantial subpopulations of Dugongs (thousands) with tens of thousands of Dugongs in northern Australia/Papua New Guinea alone (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). The percentage of mature individuals is likely to vary between various subpopulations, but is likely to be somewhere between 45% and 70% (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). Genetic information on Dugong stocks is mostly limited to the Australian region. Recent work based on mitochondrial DNA (Blair <em>et al.</em> 2014) shows that the Australian Dugong population is not panmictic. The Australian population still has high genetic diversity, indicating that recent population declines are not yet reflected in the genetic makeup of the population. Seddon <em>et al. </em>(2014) used microsatellite markers to demonstrate low, but significant, population differentiation within a regional in southern Queensland. Further data (D. Blair unpublished data) using the same genetic markers indicate considerable differentiation between southern and northern Queensland populations. Preliminary population-genetic and phylogeographic studies on Dugongs outside Australia are ongoing. These studies suggest strong regional differentiation. Australian populations are largely distinct from those elsewhere; populations in the Western Indian Ocean (Red Sea, Persian/Arabian Gulf, East Africa) are rather uniform and with limited genetic diversity; Madagascar might harbour a distinct lineage. The situation for the Indo-Malay Region is unclear but possibly more than one historical lineage occurs there. Thailand (Palmer 2004, L. Parr unpublished data) and Australia (McDonald 2005, Blair <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) are home to distinct matrilines that possibly diverged during Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, but are now able to mix geographically within those regions",Decreasing,"Dugongs inhabit coastal and island waters between East Africa and Vanuatu between latitudes of about 27° north and south of Equator. Spanning approximately 128,000 km of coastline (860,000 km<sup>2</sup>) across at least 37 and and possibly occur in an additional seven states and territories (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, N. Pilcher pers. comm).<p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Archaeological evidence confirms exploitation of Dugongs by early humans. As long as 6,000 years ago, Dugongs on the small island of Akab in the United Arabian Emirates were hunted for food (Méry <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Excavations in the Torres Strait, Australia, has revealed that Dugong hunting in this region dates back at least 4,000 years and possibly up to 7,000 years (Crouch <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wright 2010) and that the harvest has been substantial for at least 400–500 years (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008).&#160;Although hunting is now legally banned in most countries, there are important exceptions for the subsistence use by traditional peoples. In Australia, the Dugong hunting rights of ‘Native Title Holders’ (indigenous people who can prove continuous connections to their traditional land and sea country) have been consistently upheld by the courts in a series of landmark decisions since 1993. Dugong hunting still has considerable cultural significance to coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across northern Australia, and Dugong meat is considered by these groups to be the one of the highest value traditional foods. Some subsistence Dugong hunting is also allowed in the Pacific states of Papua New Guinea (restrictions apply), Vanuatu and New Caledonia (restrictions apply), where Dugongs are still of great cultural and dietary significance.Commercial exploitation of Dugongs occurred intermittently at various places along the coast of Queensland, Australia, from 1847-1969 (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Numerous products are still obtained from Dugongs and used for food, folk medicine, cooking/lubrication, aphrodisiacs, amulets/charms/jewellery, carvings, religious artefacts, leather products and other (Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Trade in Dugong (and all other sirenian) products is regulated or banned by the Convention for Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Dugongs are currently listed on CITES Appendix I.",Marine,"Dugongs are covered under three international conservation conventions: The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or the Bonn Convention). Dugongs are also included in the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), goal five (Threatened Species). Additionally, the Convention on Wetlands (the Ramsar Convention) protects some important Dugong habitats.<br/><br/>To date, there has been little effective management intervention to reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Dugong, apart from legislative protection which is almost ubiquitous throughout its range. Protected area initiatives aim to protect Dugongs in many range states (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011) and are most developed in Australia. Most of the marine protected areas outside Australia with the potential to protect Dugongs are ‘paper parks’ where laws and regulations exist but are not implemented. Strategic Action Programmes/Strategic Plans/Action Plans to protect Dugongs have been developed by countries in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region (Gerges 2002), Indonesia (de Iongh <em>et al.</em> 2009a, 2009b) and South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP; Gillespies 2005). However, effective enforcement of conservation regulations is a problem throughout most of the region because of poverty, lack of resources and personnel. The most pressing need is for alternative sustainable livelihoods that address poverty and provide incentives for conservation. The most promising initiative is the UNEP Dugong, Seagrass &amp; Coastal Communities Initiative (see <a href=""http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative"">http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative</a>).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008). It is reportedly present in at least 29 Chinese Nature Reserves (Mallon 2002, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jutzeler <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010, <span class=""A8"">Dhendup<em> et al. </em>2019).</span></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Required Conservation Actions</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Implimentation of conservation action plan (Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019).</li><li>Confirm occupancy in protected areas within the species EOO, and extend to confirm occupancy in suitable habitats predicted using distribution models. </li><li>Establish a suitable and quantifiable monitoring method for the species.</li><li>Identify and implement population monitoring in key areas that have potential to indicate the species status at a wider scale. </li><li>Identify regions where human caused threats endanger Pallas’s Cat and implement mitigation measures.&#160; </li><li>Recommend new protected areas in Pallas’s Cat hotspots not currently protected. </li><li>Increase collaboration between Pallas’s Cat researchers to validate and refine population distribution and habitat distribution models.&#160; </li><li>Understand the species population dynamics in relation to potential prey population cycles in areas where we know large population fluctuations occur (such as the Daurian steppe).

This is compounded by the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within two or arguably three generations time, that derivatives of this species are used in traditional medicine in China, both legally and illegally, and being promoted as a means of economic growth in the country and along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which could increase demand for the species and its parts, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest.<br/><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/>Currently, only Hong Kong and Taiwan, and potentially Bhutan, are parts of the range where overexploitation is not thought to be a threat to the species.","<p>This species is found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary tropical forests, limestone, bamboo, broad-leaf and coniferous forests, grasslands and agricultural fields (Chao 1989, Gurung 1996). The species digs its own burrows, or enlarges passages made by termites (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005. Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Mro hunters in Bangladesh reported that a pangolin can excavate up to 15 burrows in a single night (presumably feeding burrows) and that resident burrows can extend up to 10m deep (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). This study also revealed that like the Indian Pangolin, the Chinese Pangolin will create an earthen wall once in a resident burrow which likely aids in predator avoidance (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Indications are that home ranges are relatively large. In Taitung, Taiwan, the home range of a male was estimated 96.0 ha (100% MCP) or 66.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel; n = 1) and 14.3-30.3 ha (100% MCP) or 15.9~19.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel) for females (n = 6) (Lin, 2011) </p>  <p>The Chinese Pangolin is solitary, primarily nocturnal (sometimes crepuscular), and largely terrestrial although it is fully capable of climbing trees and, like other pangolins, swims well (Heath and Vanderlip 1988; Chao 1989). Little is known about the species' life history, although in China (including Taiwan [Province of China]), young (normally one and occasionally two) are reportedly born from August to February (Allen and Coolidge 1940, Liu and Xu 1981, Shi and Wang 1985, Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al.</em> 1993, Chin<em> et al.</em> 2011). Hunters in Viet Nam reported that they never find this species in trees and it seems likely that it is far more terrestrial than the more arboreal Sunda Pangolin (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>Lin (2011) reported that there are two type of burrows that Chinese Pangolin use, namely feeding burrows and resident burrows. Feeding burrows are created by feeding on subterranean termites and are mainly used once. Lin found no statistically significant difference between the frequency of forest and more open habitats. Resident burrows are used for shelter and resting and sleep. A male pangolin can occupy ~80 resident burrows in its home range and a female has ~30-40 resident burrows. Different individuals may use the same resting burrow but very rarely on the same day.</p>  <p>Sun <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported the nursing period of the wild Chinese Pangolin was 157 days. The infant pangolin was observed exiting the nursing burrow alone at 11 weeks old and exploring behaviors such as s soil scraping and licking were recorded. In addition, the exploring behaviours were observe while the mother had left the burrow. The growth rate of was estimated at a constant rate of 1.2 cm/week during the nursing period, which was much faster than the only record from a hand-reared individual (0.7 cm/week; see Sun <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>  <p>The diet consists of ants and termites and it has been noted that in China, there appears to be a close correlation between the Chinese Pangolin's distribution and that of two termite species (<em>Coptotermes formosanus</em> and <em>Termes</em> (<em>Cyclotermes</em>) <em>formosanus</em>) which are assumed to form a major component of the diet (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Individuals are prey selective but known prey species include <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes, Camponotus mitis, C. nicobarensis, C. variegatus dulcis, Polyrhachis demangei, Aphaenogaster exasperata, Crematogaster dohrni</em>, and termite species <em>Macrotermes barneyi</em> : this is based on analysis of stomach contents (see Lee <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p><br/></p>","The primary threat is indiscriminate hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use, with the latter primarily driven by demand in China, and the species is subject to very heavy collection pressure across much of its range (Wu and Ma 2007, Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). As has occurred historically, exploitation for nutritional, medicinal and spiritualistic purposes takes place locally (Anon 1999, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017, D'Cruze et al. 2018). However, evidence suggests that local use is now frequently forgone in favour of entering animals into national and international trade given their high financial value (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, MacMillan and Nguyen 2014). International use involves trafficking of the species and its derivatives despite the species being included in Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated that between 2000 and 2013 international trafficking in this species potentially involved ~50,000 individuals, though the actual number between 2000 and 2018 is higher (see Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In China and Viet Nam, the meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat for which affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in traditional medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Other threats include infrastructure development, habitat loss and fragmentation, and pesticide use. In China, major developments including hydropower stations and mining also pose a threat.<br/>Taiwan and Hong Kong are exceptions where populations are not threatened by heavy hunting or poaching. The threats here include predation by feral dogs, roadkill and development, i.e. conversion of land for human use. In Taiwan, research suggests that Chinese Pangolins can become trapped in burrows or tree hollows, and is a cause of mortality, as is their capture in gin traps (Sun<em> et al.</em> 2019).<strong></strong><em></em>","<p>There is very little information available on population levels at any level (local, national or global) with few exceptions, and there is a paucity of research on abundance. This species is rarely observed, principally due to its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, solitary and primarily nocturnal. Evidence indicates it has been extirpated from parts of its current range as a result of over-exploitation, and is otherwise in steep decline across most of its range (Zhang 2008, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al</em>. 2017). An exception is Taiwan where populations are suspected to be stable and potentially increasing.&#160;</p><p>China comprises the largest range state for this species, but populations have suffered severe declines in recent decades. Between the 1960-1980s up to 160,000 Chinese Pangolins were harvested annually in China for consumptive use resulting in all but the commercial extinction of the species by the 1990s (SATCM 1996, Zhang 2008). We <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that populations declined by 88-94% between the 1960s and 1990s. In 2002, Wu <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated populations in China to comprise 50,000-100,000 individuals, and in 2008 China’s then National Forestry Administration (NFA; though now National Forestry and Grassland Administration [NFGA]) estimated the national population to comprise 64,000 individuals. In contrast, Zhang<em> et al.</em> (2010) estimated the population in China in 2008 to comprise between 25,100 and 49,450 individuals. Also in 2008, the NFA (2008) estimated the population of Guangxi Province at 990 individuals with a density of 0.043 individuals/km². Interviews as part of research in China in recent years indicate this species is present but very rare in the border areas of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces (P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data), but at some sites (e.g., Dawuling Natural Reserve and Luofushan Natural Reserve), new burrows have not been seen in approaching twenty years indicating extirpation, and it is suspected that the species has been extirpated from Jiangsu, Henan and Shanghai Provinces (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2015 and 2016, more than 20 natural reserves were surveyed in southern China, but found no fresh burrows or live individuals (F. Zhang and Q. Wang, unpubl. data). Li et al. (2018) estimated that in eastern China (Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces) the species’ range contracted by 52% between 1970s and 2000s, and populations are now largely confined to the Wuyi Mountains. On Hainan Island, extensive field research between 1997 and 2013 and interviews with hunters and local people indicate the species is of very low abundance and likely commercially extinct (Nash <em>et al. </em>2016, P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data). In Hong Kong SAR, the species is present but is considered rare (G. Ades, pers. comm).<br/></p><p>In Taiwan (P.R. China) reports from the late 1980s and early 1990s suggest that populations of the nominal subspecies, the Formosan Pangolin were decreasing due to overexploitation from hunting and populations are were greatly reduced (Chao&#160; 1989, Chao <em>et al. </em>2005). After the Taiwanese government established the Wildlife Conservation Act in 1989 it appears that domestic consumption was significantly reduced. Evidence suggests populations are stable if not increasing in Taiwan and poaching is no longer the main threat. In southern Taiwan Pei (2010) estimated densities of 12-13 individuals/km². Kao <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated very approximately that the meta-population in Taiwan may comprise 15,000 individuals - though this estimate should be treated with extreme caution given significant knowledge gaps in parameters used to inform the models used to produce this estimate.</p><p>The species is very rare in Viet Nam. There are records from the past three decades from various protected areas, including Ba Na NP (Frontier Viet Nam, 1994), Cuc Phuong NP, Khe Net Nature Reserve and in Ke Go Nature Reserve (see Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). However, hunters in three areas of Viet Nam reported that although they still find the Chinese Pangolin it is extremely rare and populations have declined dramatically in the last two decades (i.e. in the 1990s and 2000s; see Newton <em>et al. </em>2008). In Khe Net and Ke Go, hunters reported that numbers of Chinese Pangolins were lower than those of the Sunda Pangolin probably because the former is easier to capture. If this is the case, then in places where both species occur, populations of the former are likely to be more heavily depleted (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008).</p><p>The species has been so heavily hunted in Lao PDR that field sightings are exceptionally rare. There were field sightings of an individual in Nam Theun Extension PNBCA (Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area) in 1994-1995, and an individual was seen in a village in Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA during the same period (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There are unverified camera trap records from Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA in the early 2010s (Coudrat, 2017).<br/></p>  <p>In Bangladesh, Chinese Pangolins in the southeast may have disappeared (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), however, there are still a few areas where they exist, such as within the Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is an absence of high-skilled hunters (Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017). In this area, there was consensus among hunters interviewed that populations in the south has been extirpated as a result of overexploitation from poaching since 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Populations in Bangladesh are suspected to be declining.</p>  <p>This species was reported in the 1980s as common in the undisturbed hill forests of Arunachal Pradesh, however, little is known about the total population in India (Tikader 1983, Zoological Survey of India 1994). However, trafficking figures suggest this species is under severe hunting pressure in Northeast India (Misra and Hanfee 2000, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/></p><p>Surveys conducted in the Royal Nagarjung Forest in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the early 1990s determined that there was a healthy population there (Gurung 1996). Nepal's population has been loosely estimated at 5,000 individuals but is suspected to be declining as a result of overexploitation (Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p><p>There is little information on the status of the species in Thailand and Myanmar. There is a potential record from Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar form post-2000 (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, southern Bhutan, north and northeastern India, northeast, northwest and southeastern Bangladesh, northern and western Myanmar, to northern and Annamite regions of Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, part of northwestern Thailand, and across southern China. In China it occurs south of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) and on Hainan, Taiwan (P.R. China) and Hong Kong SAR. The species has likely been extirpated from parts of its current range, the limits of which are poorly known and may never be elucidated, due to high levels of exploitation historically. However, Taiwanese pangolin populations have stabilized in the last two decades and may even be increasing. The species occurs at high altitudes, especially in the southern and western parts of its range. In Nepal it has been recorded up to 3,000 m asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data), though also occurs at much lower altitudes, for example in Hong Kong and likely in the northeast of its range. Its latitudinal range is thought to overlap considerably with that of the Sunda Pangolin <em>Manis javanica</em>. Where this is apparent it is hypothesized that the Chinese Pangolin occurs in hills and mountains and the former is more generally found at lower altitudes (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Viet Nam interviews with hunters in 2007 (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008) suggested that the two species can be found in the same areas of forest, and that the differences between them are ecological, relating to diet and habitat use, rather than altitude, but ecological differences between the species have yet to be fully elucidated. <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>In China the species' distribution extends from the southern border as far north as the Changjiang, including on the island of Zhoushan at the mouth of the Changjiang (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Its distribution extends to the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Huibei, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Fujian, and in the Autonomous Regions of Guangxi Zhuang, Tibet, and Hainan Island. Zhai (2000) suggest the species occurs in Xichuan county of Henan province, which would be the only record north of the Changjiang, but they provide little detail and this requires verification. In Hong Kong, the species has been recorded from the central and northeast New Territories and Lantau Island, but not on the smaller outlying islands (Shek <em>et al.</em> 2007); it occurs here at low altitudes (Reels 1996). In Taiwan (P.R. China), the species occurs on the periphery of the Central Mountain Range, the Western Foothill Range, the Taoyuan Tableland, the Ouluanpi Tableland, the East Coast Mountain Range, the Tatun Volcano Group, Taipei Basin, Puli Basin, and the Pingtun Plain (Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al</em>. 2005). The upper limit of occurrence in Taiwan is around 2,000 m asl (Chao 1989).</p><p>Beyond China, the species is distributed in northern and central Vietnam, from Ha Giang province as far south as Quang Tri Province, but is absent from the northeast coast (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is found in Cuc Phuong National Park, Khe Net Nature Reserve, and Ke Go Nature Reserve, and Ba Na National Park (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Lao PDR, the species has been recorded in the north and central parts, but there are too few locality records to determine the geographic and altitudinal range of the species in the country with any accuracy (Timmins and Evans 1996; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species is plausibly widespread in northern Myanmar, although there are few records and its exact distribution is not well known (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992). There is a record from Karen State in the early 2010s (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) report a sighting of the Sunda Pangolin in Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar, but there is uncertainty over the species' identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and it is plausibly and perhaps more likely the Chinese pangolin. There are few records from Thailand but include those from Doi Inthanon (formerly Doi Angka) in Changwat, Chiang Mai (northern Thailand), sometime in 1937 and 1939 (Allen and Coolidge 1940) and Doi Sutep, Chiangmai (northern Thailand) in 1901.</p>  <p>In Bangladesh, the species occurs in northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of the country, including in the border areas with northwestern Myanmar and India’s Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram states. Two Chinese Pangolins were captured from northwestern Bangladesh in recent years but which is thought to be the result of flash flooding from India. The species has reportedly been extirpated from most protected areas in southeastern Bangladesh. However, it does occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (southeast), Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (northeast), and Thakurgao (northwest) but has been extirpated from some areas due to poaching since around 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Bangladesh, it may be restricted to the India-Bangladesh border area only (Trageser<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p>The species is marginally present in northern India e.g. Vamiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are photographic records of the species in Bihar and it has been recorded in northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Sikkim and the northern part of West Bengal) (Tikader 1983, Zoological Society of India 2002, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). Chinese Pangolins also exist in Kaziranga-Karbi-Anglong landscape and Manas-Bhutan landscape and there are recent (post-2015) camera trap records from Manas National Park, India (D. Lahkar, unpubl. data), and reports of the species being present near Sirohi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bunning Wildlife Sanctuary and Yangoupokpi-Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary of Manipur, India (J. Sethy, unpubl. data). The species appears to be sympatric with the Indian Pangolin (<em>M. crassicaudata</em>)<em> </em>in the Neora Valley National Park (Mallick 2010) and Manas National Park (Lahkhar <em>et al.</em> 2018; Goswami and Ganesh 2014).</p>  <p>The species occurs in southern Bhutan (though potentially central and western areas only) and Nepal, where it is typically located between 555-1740 m Asl, though there are records from 3000m Asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data). A nation-wide survey of pangolins (see DNPWC and DOF 2018) in Nepal unveiled the occurrence of Chinese Pangolin throughout Nepal largely distributed in human dominated landscapes outside the protected areas, though it does occur in protected areas as well. This suggests that Chinese Pangolins are distributed across eastern, central and mid-western Nepal and the Mid hills of central Nepal harbors likely strongholds for the species. It has been recorded as present in the lower elevation belt of the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, the Gaurishankar and Annapurna Conservation Areas, Makalubarun, Sagarmatha, Chitwan, Parsa and Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Parks, the Salyan district in western Nepal (Khatiwada <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160; It has been also recorded in the Suklaphanta NP in southwest Nepal within the last four years and in Jajarkot district in mid-west Nepal (H.S. Baral, unpubl. data). In Nepal, its distribution appears to overlap with the Indian pangolin in the south and west. The Chinese Pangolin occurs from Inner Terai to hills and mountains while the Indian Pangolin is confined to lower altitudes; however, ecological differences between are not fully understood. &#160;</p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup>","<p>This species has been hunted at a local level historically, both for the consumption of its meat as a protein source, and for its scales for use as an ingredient in traditional medicines among other spiritual and ritualistic uses (Anon 1992, Zhang 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). It has also been subject to international trade historically. Based on trade data from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, this has principally involved scales&#160;or traditional medicines containing scales, as well as skins between the 1970s and the year 2000 (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015; Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016). However, following population declines in China up to the mid-1990s (see Zhang 2008), a heavy unrecorded and seemingly illicit international trade in live pangolins has occurred between Southeast Asia and China since which has involved this species (Li and Li 1998,&#160;Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught specimens of this species traded for commercial purposes. Despite this, illegal trade has continued post-2000 which is largely driven by market demand in China and mainly involves live animals and scales originating from Southeast and South Asia based on available evidence (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman, 2017). Trade in this species in particular appears to come from Myanmar (Challender and Waterman 2017). Although local use of pangolins also continues today, evidence suggests that this is often forgone in favour of selling the animals into trade, which is primarily destined to China (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; </p>  <p>In China, as well as Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat dish for which affluent consumers are willing to pay very high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers, as in Viet Nam. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>Other consumer countries include the United States which imported large quantities of derivatives including the Chinese Pangolin between 1985 and 20111 based on CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017).</p><p>There is ongoing local use across the species' range though quantifying this across the species' range is challenging. In Bangladesh, tribal communities believe that the use of pangolin meat can reduce their illness and the scales can keep away evil spirits. Local physicians also sell the scales by promoting their supposed supernatural medicine value, occasionally in cities. Trade routes exist between Bangladesh and Myanmar and pangolins are trafficked along these routes, mainly destined to China. In Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal, scales are worshipped as an incarnation of God during Tihar festival and are kept in homes to avoid evil spirits (P. Kaspal, unpubl. data). In Nepal, jhakris, local traditional healers have been using the pangolin for its supposed medicinal benefits for generations, but it is only recently that a booming trade has developed around the species which is threatening the specie. The species continues to be exploited locally for consumptive use in China (Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016), Viet Nam (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008), Bangladesh (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), northeastern India (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018) and Nepal&#160;</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The species is present in a number of protected areas across its range including in Bangladesh:&#160;Chittagong Hill Tracts, Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017); China: Dawuling Natural Reserve; India: Vamiki Tiger Reserve (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018), Manas National Park (D. Lahkar, unpubl. data), Sirohi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bunning Wildlife Sanctuary and Yangoupokpi-Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary (J.

There are older records from Lao PDR - Nam Theun Extension Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NCBA) and Nakai-Nam Theun NCBA (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999), and a dated record from Doi Inthanon National Park, Thailand.&#160;</p><p>Whilst the Chinese Pangolin is protected by national legislation in virtually all range states there and is included in CITES Appendix I, there remains a need to ensure effective enforcement and judicial proceedings in range states where hunting and poaching, trafficking and trade occur (Challender and Waterman 2017). Additional interventions are also needed including efforts to reduce demand for pangolin products among consumers in key markets and ensure local community buy-in to conservation efforts within and around key sites. &#160;</p>  <p>Research is required into the population status of this species, including population parameters and its ability to withstand current and projected hunting and poaching pressures.

171131310,19771,Rupicapra pyrenaica,Least Concern,,2020,2020-03-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is currently increasing in numbers and range. It is not believed to approach the thresholds for any of the criteria for the IUCN Red List. Consequently, it is assessed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>R. p. pyrenaica</em> and <em>R. p. parva</em> are also Least Concern. However,<em> R. p. ornata</em> is assessed here as Vulnerable (D1+2) as this subspecies lives in very small populations and has restricted area of occupancy. It was previously assessed in 1996 as Endangered, but because of strict protection and a programme of captive breeding and reintroductions and introductions, its population has increased such that it no longer meets criterion D at this level. Ongoing conservation measures are required to ensure its future conservation.","The species is found in alpine meadows, rocky areas, forested valleys and lower slopes in mountainous regions. It generally stays above 1,800 m in alpine meadows during the warmer months of the year (Corlatti <em>et al.</em> in press). These animals make seasonal movements from steep forests in the valley slopes (in winter) to the open alpine meadows in summer (e.g. Corlatti <em>et al.&#160;</em>in press). In recent years, some populations have started to permanently inhabit forests (Herrero <em>et al.</em> 1996). Some Cantabrian populations live at 200 m. Males and females live separately outside the rutting period. Females live in groups of adults with young, while males are more solitary. The rut takes place in November and early December, and females give birth to one young after 160-170 days of gestation (Loison 1995). Longevity is about 20 years (Loison 1995).","For Pyrenean Chamois, diseases are currently the most important threat. Several keratoconjunctivitis outbreaks (Arnal <em>et al.</em> 2013) and the Pestivirus since 2001 affect populations (Serrano <em>et al</em>. 2015). Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei affects central Cantabrian population (Nores &amp; González-Quirós 2009). In Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountains, chamois coexist with domestic livestock, but there do not appear to be problems with competition; indeed, in the Pyrenees the presence of domestic livestock is considered to benefit the chamois, via maintenance of young and good quality forage, which increases the carrying capacity. Most Pyrenean and Cantabrian populations are hunted, with the exception of those living in National Parks and other Protected Areas as Nature Reserves. Pyrenean Chamois are a major game subspecies, except for Navarre region (Spain) where it was Vulnerable until 2019 and then it has been delisted (Herrero <em>et al.</em> 2016) and is important socially and economically as a source of rural livelihoods. Hunting is carefully managed and revenue from hunting is returned to the local community in Game Reserves in Spain (Pita Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Spain the regional governments and in Andorra the government set quotas, and hunting is not at an unsustainable level. In France, hunting is essentially a recreational and non-profit leisure activity, and average annual quotas are under 10% of censused populations. This is sustainable, with only a few local exceptions (C. Berducou pers. comm. 2006).The threats to the species vary in different parts of its range. Apennine Chamois may be vulnerable to many factors because their total number is small, locally decreasing, divided in only five populations, and genetic variability is very low (e.g. Lorenzini 2005, Corlatti <em>et al.</em> 2011). Space and food competition with livestock, especially domestic Caprinae, seem to have been the main limiting factors. Some poaching occurs, but does not seem to impair the viability of the populations. There are currently no problems with disease for the Italian subspecies.&#160;Presently, the major threat for Apennine Chamois seems to be the ongoing climatic change, which alters the structure, abundance and distribution of grasslands used by this ungulate, with effects on juvenile malnutrition in summer and an increase of winter mortality (Lovari <em>et al.</em>&#160;submitted).Some negative effects of high temperature/low rainfall in spring on individual survival have been reported also for an area of the French Pyrenees (Loison <em>et al.</em> 1999). Locally, chamois are also outcompeted by red deer<em> Cervus elaphus</em>, which has been recolonising Apennine areas formerly used only by chamois (Lovari <em>et al.</em> 2014, Ferretti <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Moreover, vegetation dynamics in secondary meadows of the Apennines have reduced the availability of nutritious pasture through the ongoing spread of poorly palatable plants (Corazza <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Overall, the status of this species has greatly improved since 1990. The population and range of the Pyrenean Chamois increased markedly from 1989 to 2003, although there have subsequently been some declines due to keratoconjunctivitis Mycoplasma conjunctivae (Arnal <em>et al. </em>2013) and pestivirus outbreaks (Marco <em>et al.</em> 2009, Serrano <em>et al. </em>2015). The estimate was around 53,000 in 2002 (Herrero<em> et al.</em>&#160;2004) belonging to one metapopulation. Densities of Pyrenean Chamois tend to be lower outside non-huntable areas (National Parks, Natural Reserves) and Game Reserves.&#160;<br/>The Cantabrian Chamois lives in three populations, Western, Central and Eastern. The Western and Central have around 16,000 (Pérez-Barbería <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) animals. The Eastern, result of a reintroduction in 2002-2005 (Sánchez-Martínez<em> et al. </em>2011) had 131 in 2017.&#160;<br/>Contrary to the other subspecies, numbers of the Apennine Chamois remain small. Numbers have probably been low for the last few centuries, only starting to increase in the 1920s as a result of increased protection. Numbers plummeted again to just several tens of individuals in a single population in the Abruzzo National Park during World War II (Lovari 1989). As a result of conservation actions, including re-introductions and conservation introductions, numbers have increased again and total population size is currently estimated at no less than 2,500 individuals, in five separate populations (Mari and Lovari 2006, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2019), up from a total of c. 400 individuals in the late 1980s (Lovari 1989). Presently, the number of mature individuals does not exceed 1,500.",Increasing,"<em>Rupicapra pyrenaica</em> is endemic to south-west Europe, where it occurs as three subspecies: Pyrenean Chamois <em>R. p. pyrenaica</em>, Cantabrian Chamois <em>R. p. parva</em> and Apennine Chamois <em>R. p. ornata</em> (Shackleton 1997, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). The Pyrenean Chamois is found in the Pyrenean mountains, in Andorra, France and Spain. The Cantabrian Chamois occurs in the Cantabrian mountains (Spain). The Apennine Chamois now survives only in five small to very small populations in the Abruzzo, Majella, Gran Sasso-Monti della Laga and Monti Sibillini National Parks, as well as in the Sirente-Velino Regional Park in Italy, although earlier in the Holocene it ranged from the Sibillini mountains (Marche Region, Italy) down to the Pollino massif (Calabria Region, Italy) (Masini 1985, Masini and Lovari 1988). The altitudinal range of the species is 200-3,000 m.",Hunting of this species is generally well managed and sustainable.,Terrestrial,"The species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and Annex V of the EU Habitats and Species Directive (as part of <em>R. rupicapra</em> sensu lato).&#160;In Spain, the species occurs in several Protected Areas and Game Reserves, including non-huntable areas (Picos de Europa, Ordesa y Monte Perdido and Aigüestortes i Llach de Sant Maurici National Parks; Larra-Belagoa and Muniellos Nature Reserves); and huntable ones, as Natural Parks (Fuentes del Narcea, Degaña e Ibias, Somiedo, Las Ubiñas-La Mesa, Ponga, Redes, Alt Pallars-Aran, Posets-Maladeta, Cadí, Los Valles Occidentales); Game Reserves (Los Valles, Viñamala, Los Circos, Benasque, Cerdanya, Cadi, Fresser Setcasas, Mampodre, Saja, Somiedo), among others. In France, it occurs in a number of protected areas (Pyrenees National Park, Roc-Blanc, Moudang and Mont-Vallier Mountain Reserves, Orlu Natural Reserve) and other small reserves where hunting is banned. A study of population dynamics is ongoing in France in Orlu and Bazes, epidemiological situation, as well as a detailed survey of the population size and distribution (Richard <em>et al. </em>2017, Lambert <em>et al.</em> 2018). In France, there is a hunting plan that is designed to correct geographic imbalances in numbers and distribution, but might be difficult to achieve. A major restoration effort was carried out in the French Pyrenees between 1981 and 2000, involving the translocation of more than 600 individuals (Herrero<em> et al. </em>2004, C. Novoa and C. Berducou pers. comm. 2006). New reintroductions have been carried out in the last years. In Andorra there is a monitoring and a sustainable hunting quota inside and outside reserves&#160;Apennine Chamois inhabit five separate protected areas. A group of 22 chamois was released in the Majella National Park between 1991 and 1994, and 26 were re-introduced into the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. Small captive breeding groups have been kept in six large enclosures in five parks. No studbook has been kept, which is a major shortcoming in this captive breeding program (Shackleton 1997). The subspecies is strictly protected under national and international legislation - it is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, Annex II* and IUCN Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive, Appendix II of CITES, and as a “specially protected species” under Italian hunting law. Proposed conservation measures include the following: 1) consider conservation introductions to other protected areas in the central Apennines, once their suitability has been adequately assessed. 2) When selecting individuals for transplants and captive breeding, consider the low genetic variability of this subspecies. This was most likely a result of living at low density for a long time and of population bottlenecks occurring at World Wars I and II. 3) Keep detailed breeding records, genetic profiles, and develop a studbook, for each of the captive breeding populations. 4) Avoid releasing Alpine Chamois into areas of potential (re)introduction of Apennine Chamois as, if such an action was carried out, it would prevent the subsequent release of the latter species (Shackleton 1997).<br/>Future priorities for the species as a whole include extending monitoring of all populations and increasing knowledge of demography, global change and the impact of hunting. It is particularly important that monitoring and research should take place also outside protected areas, i.e. where chamois are hunted.",Palearctic,,false,false,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean"
