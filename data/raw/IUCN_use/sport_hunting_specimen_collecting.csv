Within this range the species  is highly fragmented, occupying highly specialized patches of scarce  heath habitat. These fragmented populations form a dispersed  metapopulation within a matrix of unsuitable habitat. Population  declines have been observed along the northern portion of its range and  in the marginal habitat in which it occurs (Ballesteros 2003, 2007,  2018), the continuing decline is due to hunting, predation, poisoning  and habitat change. The Broom Hare is listed as Vulnerable in Spain,  although it is not included in the Spanish Catalog of Endangered Species  or the Spanish List of Wildlife Species of Special Protection Regime.  The species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion B1ab(v).","Little is known about the home range, population density, or food  preferences of the Broom Hare, although they are likely similar to those  of European Hares in comparable habitat.<br/><br/>The Broom Hare occupies  an elevational range of 1,300-1,900 m, descending in winter to 1,000 m  to avoid snow. This habitat consists of heathland where the dominant  vegetation forms are Erica, Calluna, and Vaccinium, and where the shrub  cover consisting of <em>Cytisus</em>, <em>Genista</em>, and <em>Juniperus </em>(Flux and Angermann  1990, Ballasteros and Palacios 2009, Ballesteros 2018). A habitat  suitability model determined that the Broom Hare preferentially selects  areas characterized by a high percentage of broom and heather  scrublands, high altitude and slope, and limited human accessibility  (quantified as distance to roads) (Acevedo <em>et al.</em> 2007). Its  habitat also includes cleared areas of mixed deciduous forest of <em>Fagus  </em>and <em>Quercus</em>. The Broom Hare also selects habitat that has been burned  and areas where broom has been cleared – such as within Somiedo Natural  Park.","There has been excessive hunting at the western edge of the distribution  of the Broom Hare, where hares are isolated from the rest of the  population during the summer. The species is also subject to predation,  poisoning (fertilizer and pesticides), and habitat change due to climate  change. Apparently grazing by native livestock breeds has provided an  increase in favourable habitats for the Broom Hare.","The Broom Hare is experiencing a decline in relation to specific  portions of its distribution that are disturbed by human activities and  excessive hunting. Fragmentation, resulting from the patchy distribution  of suitable habitat, has produced a dispersed metapopulation of this  species (Ballesteros 2007). A habitat suitability model indicated that  the Broom Hare was experiencing a decreasing population trend of 16.67%,  while the fragmented metapopulation structure was increasing by 4.1%,  although there was no appreciable change in these elements for 71% of  the populations (Acevedo <em>et al.</em> 2007). Nocturnal censuses with  spotlights have determined average densities of 4.83/100 ha, 6.89/100ha,  and between 8.83 and 23.32/100 ha in various protected areas. The species  apparently does not cycle in density, although some differences can be  noted among years due to variation in reproductive success (Ballesteros  2018).",Decreasing,"The distribution of the Broom Hare is limited to the Cantabrian  Mountains in the northwest of Spain (Ballesteros 2018). It occupies  elevations from 1,000 to 1,900 m between the Sierra de los Ancares and  the Sierra de Pena Labra. Its range is approximately 25-40 km from north to south, and 230 km east to west. The EOO is 8,437  km². Within this range the Broom Hare is highly fragmented, as it  occupies highly specialized patches of scarce habitat (Ballesteros 2007,  2018).","Although the Broom Hare is listed as vulnerable in Spain, it is still  hunted as a game species in some regions (Cantabria, Leon).",Terrestrial,"Research to determine the effects of habitat change, predation pressure,  and illegal hunting. It is important to develop a hunting plan for all  the regional reserves and private hunting areas designed to accommodate  the specific characteristics of the Broom Hare. Care should be taken to  ensure that there is no release of any other hare species within the  range of the Broom Hare. Feral dogs and cats should be controlled within  the range of the Broom Hare. Habitat improvements should be made where  the environment has been altered and is no longer suitable for  occupation by Broom Hares. Corridors should be established among local  populations to bolster interbreeding within the existing metapopulation.

Subspecies <em>marmota </em>is common within at least parts of its range and has no major threats. However, subspecies <em>latirostris </em> has a restricted range and small population, and should be monitored and protected.","It inhabits alpine meadows and high-altitude pastures, typically on south-facing slopes from 1,200-3,000 m (although it is occasionally found at lower altitudes). Colonies inhabit deep burrow systems in alluvial soil or rocky areas (Preleuthner 1999). It has a herbivorous diet, primarily composed of green parts of grasses, sedges, and herbs (Krapp 1978).","Marmots were previously hunted for meat, fur, and fat (which was used for cosmetics and medicines). Hunting continues today, but is primarily a leisure activity (Preleuthner 1999). In Slovenia and Austria, hunting levels are sustainable, but in Austria at least populations living below the timberline are threatened by loss of open habitats through abandonment of high-altitude cattle grazing (Spitzenberger 2002, B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006). Hybridisation with introduced <em>M. m. marmota</em> is a potential future threat to remaining pure-bred populations of <em>M. m. latirostris</em> in the High Tatras.","<em>M. m. marmota </em>is abundant in at least parts of its core range in the Alps, although some subpopulations may be under threat (e.g. in the Jura and in Germany). Reported population densities for <em>M. m. marmota </em>range from 24-36 individuals per 100 hectares (Gran Paradiso, Italy) to 40-80 individuals per 100 hectares (Tessin, Switzerland). In Romanian Carpathians, the population is estimated at 1,500 individuals. It is known from three areas in Romania: Retezat, Fagaras and Rodna. In Retezat and Fagaras the populations are stable; in Rodna the population is very small and is threatened by poaching (Popescu and Murariu 2001, Botnariuc and Tatole 2005).

2952954,41305,Lepus corsicanus,Vulnerable,A2bcde,2019,2018-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This assessment is based on field surveys (spotlight censuses, hunting  bag, captures, etc.) and on molecular analyses of specimens collected by  a network of helpers (hunters, park rangers, etc.). This species has  been monitored since 1997 in continental Italy and Sicily. The Corsican  Hare shows a variable conservation status across its distribution range.  Due to the fragmentation and scarcity of Corsican Hare populations in  continental Italy, its mainland status is classified as nationally  endangered (following Angelici and Luiselli 2001). However, the creation  of several protected areas in southern and central Italy should help  the populations to recover. In Sicily, the Corsican Hare is widespread  and the populations are locally abundant, although in this restricted  area. Furthermore, since its official recognition as true species  (1998), the local government has forbidden hare hunting on the island.  However, hunting of this species was permitted during the 2004-2005  hunting season in Sicily. Therefore, in Sicily the Corsican Hare does  not appear to be threatened.<br/><br/>The species was introduced to  Corsica, probably in the first half of the 14th century, then the  species was wrongly deemed extinct in Corsica in 1984 (Dubray and Roux  1984) and then rediscovered on the island by Scalera and Angelici  (2002). The populations are increasing in the northern region of the  island, but are found in a more precarious status in the south (Pietri  2015).<br/><br/>Globally, this species is classified as Vulnerable due to  its variable conservation status across its geographic range. Utilizing  information currently available regarding the historical range on  continental Italy, we replicated this portion of the range using GIS to  calculate the total area (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 1999). The result  showed that the historical range on continental Italy was approximately  79,700 km². Online sources gave an area of approximately 25,700 km² for  Sicily. This provides a total area of 105,400 km² as the historical  range for the Corsican Hare. We infer an approximate decline of 91% for  the actual continental occupancy areas of populations in 2015 from the  map provided in Pierpaoli (1999). From this we derived an overall  decrease in occupied area of 69.2% for the species as a whole. Over the  past decade Corsican Hares have declined 50% for continental  populations, and thus an estimated 38% for the species as a whole  (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2018). These declines have resulted from a  variety of causes. Although the species is protected from hunting in  continental Italy and Sicily, it remains difficult to distinguish the  species from the European Hare and there may be significant collateral  deaths due to hunting and illegal poaching. Additionally, increasing  habitat degradation and predation by foxes and feral dogs negatively  impact Corsican Hare populations. The species has undergone significant  fragmentation of populations which reduces gene flow and may lead to  inbreeding depression. Corsican Hares are susceptible to EHBS and RHDV2  viruses (Camarda <em>et al.</em> 2014), which can lead to severe local declines in numbers. The species is confirmed as Vulnerable under criterion A2bcde.","Information about the ecology of this species is still limited. However,  it seems well adapted to the Mediterranean environment, although it has  been recorded from sea level to 2,400 m asl on Mount Etna (Sicily).  The preferred habitats are the Mediterranean maquis and the mosaic of  clearings (also cultivated), bushy areas, and broad-leaved woods.  Furthermore the Corsican Hare inhabits also coastal dune habitat. When  it is in sympatry with the European Hare, the latter species tends to be  more a habitat generalist, while the Corsican Hare seems to inhabit  almost only pastures and grasslands. In Sicily, the species inhabits a  variety of natural and artificial habitats: open grassland, bushy  pastures, cultivated areas, etc.<br/><br/>In terms of elevation, the  European Hare and Corsican Hare do not differ significantly when they  live allopatrically. According to Angelici and Luiselli (2001), when the  two species coexist in sympatry, the Corsican Hare occurs at elevations  significantly higher than the European Hare. The Corsican Hare inhabits  significantly higher elevations when it lives allopatrically than when  it lives sympatrically, and the Corsican Hare inhabits significantly  higher elevations when it lives sympatrically than when it lives  allopatrically. However, this ecological allocation is not shared by  Trocchi and Riga (2005) who always directly observed, in sympatric  condition, the European Hare occupying the mountain grassland and the  Corsican Hare inhabiting the lower and warmer areas with thermophilous  oak woods.<br/><br/>The diet of the Corsican Hare, studied in Sicily,  varies seasonally as the available vegetation changes. Monocotyledones,  Cyperaceae and Juncaceae, are ingested year round, while Gramineae and  Labiatae are consumed during spring and summer, respectively (De  Battisti <em>et al.</em> 2004). Dicotyledones ingested year round by the Corsican Hare are Leguminosae and Compositae (De Battisti <em>et al.</em>  2004). In southern Italy the Corsican Hare is known to consume over 70  different species of plants, primarily grasses and herbs (Freschi <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2015, 2016).<br/><br/>The Corsican Hare may serve as a prey item for native carnivores and endangered raptors.","The main threats to the Corsican Hare have been identified in the following aspects: fragmentation of the range, low or absent genetic flow between populations, low population density, habitat loss, introduction of the European Hare in central and southern Italy (with interspecific competition); competition with European Rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) - mainly in Sicily (where this species is widely distributed), disease spread – the Corsican Hare is fully susceptible to EBHS and RHDV2 (see Camarda <em>et al.</em> 2014), over-hunting, poaching, and predation by foxes and feral dogs (both abundant and largely distributed in southern Italy). The Corsican Hare is susceptible to accidental mortality due to difficulties distinguishing it from the European Hare by hunters (Angelici and Luiselli 2001). Potential hybridization between the European Hare and Corsican Hare could constitute a future threat to the species in continental Italy (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003, Mengoni <em>et al. </em>2014); however hybridization with the Iberian Hare and the European Hare has been assessed in Corsica (Pietri <em>et al.</em> 2011). On the major threat list ""other"" has been checked and identified as intraspecific genetic pollution.","Populations of the Corsican Hare in the Italian peninsula have a fragmented distribution and are sometimes in sympatry and syntopy with the European Hare. Density estimates highlight low values in hunting areas (0.5 hares/km²) and higher in protected areas (11 hares/km²). In mainland Italy the Corsican Hare is decreasing because of habitat degradation, hunting pressure, and probably from competition with introduced European Hares. However, in Sicily, where there are not populations of the European Hare, the Corsican Hare is continuously distributed and locally abundant (protected areas: 10 hares/km²; hunting areas: 2 hares/km²). In Corsica’s main range, namely Haute-Corse, the species appears to demonstrate a population increase. In the other two parts of the island (Cap Corse and Sagone) the status of the species has proven to be much more precarious, the small population size or the hybridization with the Iberian Hare and European Hare being major threats to the species (Pietri 2015).",Decreasing,"Until the 1930s, the Corsican Hare was distributed in south-central  Italy (the northern limit being marked by Elba Island on the Tyrrhenian  coast and the province of Foggia on the Adriatic coast) and Sicily. It  was also present in Corsica, where it was introduced by man in  historical times (maybe between the 14th and 17th centuries). The  current distribution of the Corsican Hare is still poorly known. In  Sicily, the distribution seems to be continuous, whereas in the Italian  Peninsula, populations are known only in Tuscany (in Grosseto province),  Latium, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia (Gargano), Campania, Basilicata and  Calabria. It has been recorded from sea level to 2,400 m a.s.l. on Mount  Etna. Recently the presence of the Corsican Hare has been rediscovered  in Corsica, too (Scalera and Angelici 2002). The distribution of Italian  Hare covers three distinct parts on the island, for a total surface  area of close to 2,900 km², 97% of which is situated in a single region,  namely Haute-Corse, the other two areas are Cap Corse and Sagone.  Habitat suitability models for central Italy suggest high suitability of  the internal mountain ranges as well as the Mediterranian maquis along  the coast (Angelici <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).","Today the Corsican Hare is legally protected in continental Italy because of the poor conservation status of its populations. However, the problematic discrimination in the field between the Corsican Hare and the European Hare (a game species) produces remarkable problems for effective protection. Since the Corsican Hare was recognized as a true species (1998), hare hunting has been banned in Sicily. During the 2004-2005 hunting season, this ban was lifted allowing the hunting of all hares in Sicily. In Corsica it is a game species, since it is not distinguished from the European Hare in the French hunting act.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Corsican Hare is legally protected in continental Italy because of its poor conservation status (primarily low population size).

Moors and bogland are the preferred habitats for this species in Ireland and Scotland (Flux and Angermann 1990).  However, <em>L. timidus hibernicus</em> will also utilize cultivated land, rich agricultural area, in Ireland (Thulin 2003).  <em>L. timidus</em> occupies lowland woodlands of open steppe in southern Russia along with reed belts around lakes (Flux and Angermann 1990).  In Mongolia, it occurs in forests located on the Altai, Hingan, Hentei, Hovsgol, and Hangai mountain ranges (Mallon 1985). <br/><br/>The diet of <em>L. timdus</em> varies in relation to the type of habitat it occupies (Flux and Angermann 1990).  <em>Calluna</em> (heather) constitutes the bulk of the diet in Scotland, while birch, juniper, poplar, willow, and <em>Vaccinium</em> are selected in Europe (Flux and Angermann 1990).

The reason for this is believed to be competitive exclusion, <em>L. timidus</em> yields habitat to <em>L. europaeus</em> (Thulin 2003).<br/><br/>Litter size of <em>L. timidus</em> is variable (two to six) according to the number of litters and the latitude (Angerbjorn pers. comm.).  Gestation time is between 47-55 days (Angerbjorn pers. comm.).  The breeding season is February to August (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).   <em>L. timidus</em> reaches maturity at one year of age.  Longevity for <em>L. timidus</em> is nine years (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).  Natural mortality for juveniles is 80%, while adult mortality is 58% (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).

The pathogens, European Brown Hare Syndrome (EHBS) and Tularemia, are considered problematic, but require research to determine how great an impact they inflict (Thulin 2003).  Competitive exclusion occurring between the mountain hare and the European brown hare could be restricting the distribution of the former (Thulin 2003).  The discovery of an introduced population of <em>L. europaeus</em> to Ireland could pose a threat to <em>L. t. hibernicus</em> (Reid pers. comm.).","<em>L. timidus</em> is an abundant species within its range (Flux and Angermann 1990).  Populations appear to be stable across much of its geographic distribution, with fluctuations occurring in northern Europe and possible declines in the Alps (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em> 1999).  Population declines have been observed in Russia and in the extreme, southern portions of Sweden, <em>L. timidus</em> has disappeared entirely (Thulin 2003).  <em>L. timidus</em> is found at low densities in tundra areas (Angerbjorn pers. comm.).  In Northern Ireland, historical game bag records indicate that there has been a substantial decline in hare abundance (Dingerkus and Montgomery 2002).

In Scotland and Ireland heather moors and bogland are favoured habitats, and in southern Russia copses in the middle of open steppe and reed belts around lakes. The diet varies with the habitat. In Scotland and Ireland much heather, <em>Calluna</em>, is eaten, but this is not a major food item elsewhere in Europe where willow, aspen, birch, juniper, poplar, and <em>Vaccinium</em> are favoured (Flux and Angermann 1990). Palatable grasses and clovers are taken when available. Mountain hares are nocturnal, but there is increased daylight activity in summer when nights are short, or in winter when food is scarce (Flux and Angermann 1990). In areas where <em>L. timidus</em> and <em>L. europaeus</em> coexist, <em>L. timidus</em> retreats to areas of higher elevation, presumably as a result of competitive exclusion (Thulin 2003).","It is hunted as game, but current hunting rates appear to be sustainable in most parts of its European range. <em>L. timidus</em> has successfully hybridized with <em>L. europaeus</em> in areas where the latter has been introduced (Thulin 2003). The pathogens European Brown Hare Syndrome (EHBS) and tularemia may be problematic, but research is required to determine how great an impact they have on wild populations (Thulin 2003). Competitive exclusion of the mountain hare by the European brown hare may restrict the distribution of the former (Thulin 2003), and anthropogenic climate change may affect competitive relationships between these two species. The discovery of an introduced population of <em>L. europaeus</em> to Ireland could pose a threat to the Irish subspecies <em>L. t. hibernicus</em> (N.

Periodic population crashes occur, potentially as a result of disease (tularaemia, a bacterial infection), parasitism, predation, or starvation (Angerbjorn and Flux 1995, Sulkava 1999). Population densities of 1-10 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> are typical in range states (e.g., Scotland and Finland).

It is difficult to quantify population trend, but it seems reasonable to suspect an overall decline, based on the data gathered by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (LCIE 2007). There is unlikely to be any significant rescue effect because populations are fragmented and isolated.","Throughout Europe and Siberia, lynx are associated primarily with forested areas which have good ungulate populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Central Asia lynx occur in more open, thinly wooded areas. The species probably occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the treeline. On the better-forested southern Himalayan slopes, there are only a few records from Nepal (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Karan Bahadur Shah pers. comm. 2008).  Lynx occur sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau, and are found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Eurasian lynx is the largest lynx, and the only one to primarily take ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller prey where ungulates are less abundant (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In European Russia and western Siberia, where roe deer are absent, mountain hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base. Hares and birds are important prey also in other Central Asian regions where habitats are dryer and less forested (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).  Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smallest ungulate species in the community (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Home range size varies widely (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), but averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland's Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 1997).

Detailed status and trend information can be found on www.kora.unibe.ch/en/proj/elois/online/index.html (ELOIS, the European Lynx Online Information System).<br/><br/>The lynx's stronghold is a broad strip of southern Siberian woodland stretching through eastern Russia from the Ural mountains to the Pacific, and the Russian lynx population has been estimated at 30,000-35,000 (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).  Although large portions of its range lie in China, status there is poorly known, and the government considers the population to be decreasing in a recent global survey of lynx status (Govt of US 2007).

Shackleton (1997) proposes the following measures for agrimi on Crete: 1) Establish a strict control program to eliminate feral goats inside Samaria National Park to remove the threat of hybridization with the agrimi. Only reducing or eliminating the herds of domestic goats from the surrounding areas will prevent their immigration into the Park. 2) Continue improving the control of poaching by regularly patrolling the Park during winter, and by allowing no further increases in access. 3) Impose greater controls on tourism developments in the Park. These should include banning the development of major tourist facilities (chair/ski lifts, hotels, restaurants, roads, etc.) in the mountain regions of the Park and its surroundings, and strictly controlling visitor use (e.g. specific hours of use enforced, no overnight use of the Park). 4) The population should be censused and the area surveyed regularly throughout the Lefka mountains, paying special attention to the degree of hybridisation and human encroachment. 5) Overall, it may be desirable to eradicate domestic x wild goat hybrids, unfortunately F1 hybrids are difficult to distinguish from agrimi in either external appearance or behaviour. (However, compared to agrimi, the hybrid' s coat appears to be slightly longer and interspersed with black hairs, the horns are curved outwards a little more and are more robust, and the resting tail is held more horizontal than downwards.) 6) Determine the degree of hybridization of the goats found on the various islands to help direct conservation management decisions. <br/><br/>On Majorca, the wild goat has been studied since 2001 and several groups have been protected in fenced areas and captive-bred (B.

There is no recent estimate of the overall population size for the species, and its trends are unknown.",Unknown,"This species is found in Russia, where they occur in the Putorana Mountains, north central Siberia, northeast Siberia from Lena River east to Chukotka and Kamchatka (Baskin 1985, Grubb, 2005, Pavlinov <em>et al</em> 2002).<br/> <br/>The snow sheep is distributed throughout most of the mountain regions of eastern Siberia (Russia). The main distribution area begins just east of the Lena River and stretches as far as the Tenkany mountains on the Chukotsk peninsula on the western edge of the Bering Strait (Pavlinov <em>et al</em> 2002). This sheep also occurs in the volcanic mountains running down the Kamchatka peninsula, and the southern limit of the species appears to be in the Yablonovoi Range, south of the Lena River (Pavlinov <em>et al</em> 2002, Bunch <em>et al</em>. 2006). In addition, a totally isolated population, referred to Putoran snow sheep (<em>O. n. borealis</em>) is restricted to the Putoran Mountains south of the Tamyr peninsula (about 66° to 70°N and 92° to 98°E), east of the Yenisey River, and separated from the nearest Yakutian population by about 1,000 km (Sipko <em>et al</em>. 1999, Pavlinov <em>et al</em> 2002).",,Terrestrial,"The Kamchatka sheep (<em>O. n. nivicola</em>) was listed as Category III in the Russian Red Data Book (Ivanenko, 1999 <http: nature.ok.ru="""" index.htm="""">). Despite this, some have been hunted recently by foreign trophy hunters. Sheep in the Koryak and Chukchi ranges are listed under <em>O. n. koriakum</em> as Category II in the Russian Red Data Book (1983). The other subspecies are considered as game animals and a limited number of licenses are being sold in Yakutia and Kamchatka, many to foreign hunters. Approximately 1,300 Putoran sheep are protected in the Putoran Reserve, about 600 of the Kamchatka subspecies occur in Kronotsky Reserve, while for Okhotsk sheep, about 1,700 are protected in the Magadan Reserve and 1,200 in Dzhugdzhur Reserve. Conservation measures proposed: 1)  Establish the several reserves for conservation of the Yakutian subspecies in the Tuora-Siz range (Lower Lena river) and in the Chersky range. Reserves would also be valuable in Chukotsk, Koryak Uplands and’in Kamchatka for the conservation of their respective populations. 2) Undertake censuses of numbers to verify distributions and population estimates.

There are records of lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer in press).  Although lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills. <br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting.  Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g.,  from 266-4,532 km²  in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001), and 20,500 km² in the Serengeti (West and Packer in press). <br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic lion is dry deciduous forest.  The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock.  Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic lion's diet, although the most common prey is the chital deer.  Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The main threats to lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect life and livestock) and prey base depletion.  Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of populations becoming small and isolated (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that each lion cost ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-lion conflict (Frank <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for providing financial resource for lion conservation for both governments and local communities.  However, there is concern that current management regimes can lead to unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Disease has also been a threat to lion populations (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by lions, with up to 400 human lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda 2007).","There have been few efforts in the past to estimate the number of lions in Africa. Myers (1975) wrote, ""Since 1950, their [lion] numbers may well have been cut in half, perhaps to as low as 200,000 in all or even less"". Later, Myers (1986) wrote, ""In light of evidence from all the main countries of its range, the lion has been undergoing decline in both range and numbers, often an accelerating decline, during the past two decades"". In the early 1990s, IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group members made educated ""guesstimates"" of 30,000 to 100,000 for the African lion population (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>The most quantitative historical estimate of the African lion population in the recent past was made by Ferreras and Cousins (1996), who developed a GIS-based model to predict African lion range and numbers, calibrated by surveying experts about the factors affecting lion populations. First they correlated vegetation (Leaf Area Index) with lion densities, using known values from 37 studies in 19 African protected areas, and mapped potential lion range. Then the reduction effect of human activities on lion range and numbers were estimated. Lion experts were surveyed in order to develop and rank a set of factors which would lead to lower lion densities as well as lion absence. These included agriculture, human population density, cattle grazing, and distance from a protected area, and were derived from GIS databases of varying age. For example, in areas identified as main cattle grazing areas lion density was reduced by 90%, and in areas identified as having widespread agricultural cultivation or high human population density (&gt; 2.5 people/km²) Lions were considered absent. Lion density was reduced by 50% in areas with low human population density (1-2.5 people/km²). Because of the age of their data sources on extent of agriculture and pastoralism, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) selected 1980 as the base year for their predicted African lion population of 75,800. They emphasized the need for ground-truthing their estimate by censusing lions, particularly outside protected areas.<br/><br/>Two recent surveys have provided current estimates of the African lion population, with some ground-truthing. The African Lion Working Group, a network of specialists affiliated with the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group, conducted a mail survey and compiled estimates of 100 known African lion populations. Not included were populations of known existence, but unknown or unestimated size. The ALWG African lion population estimate is 23,000, with a range of 16,500-30,000 (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). The second survey was carried out by Philippe Chardonnet and sponsored by the International Foundation for the Conservation of Wildlife and Conservation Force (Chardonnet 2002). He also compiled estimates for 144 individual African lion populations, grouped into 36 largely isolated subpopulations. His methodology included extrapolation of estimates of known populations into areas where lion status was unknown, and his total figure is not surprisingly larger: 39,000 lions in Africa, with a range of 29,000-47,000.<br/><br/>Approximately 30% of the individual population estimates compiled by the African Lion Working Group were based on scientific surveys. Techniques for these surveys included total count based on individually identified body features, sampling by use of calling stations playing recordings of hyaena and/or lion prey, and mark-recapture methods including radio telemetry, photo databases, and spoor counts (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). Seventy percent of their population figures were derived from expert opinion or guesstimate. In the other survey, 63% of Chardonnet's (2002) individual population estimates were based on expert opinions or guesstimates. Twelve percent of Chardonnet's (2002) estimates were based on scientific surveys, and a further 25% were derived from extrapolation of variables from nearby populations and catch-per-unit effort-estimates based on lion trophy hunting.<br/><br/>Estimating the size of the African lion population is an ambitious exercise involving many uncertainties. The three main efforts (Ferreras and Cousins 1996; Chardonnet 2002; Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004) all use different methods. The African Lion Working Group compiled individual population estimates primarily from protected areas (23,000 lions: Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). In 1980, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted 18,600 lions to occur in protected areas. This was probably an underestimate as not all protected areas inhabited by lions at that time were included. Still, the comparison suggests that the number of lions in African protected areas has remained stable or possibly increased over time. But Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted that most lions in 1980 were found outside protected areas. Chardonnet (2002) finds that unprotected areas still comprise a significant portion (half) of the lion's current African range. Comparison of Ferreras and Cousin's (1996) prediction of 75,800 lions in 1980 (roughly three lion generations ago) to Chardonnet's (2002) estimate of 39,000 lions yields a suspected decline of 48.5%. This calculation suggests a substantial decline in lions outside protected areas over the past two decades. Ferreras and Cousins (1996) may have over-estimated the African lion population in 1980, as their number was derived from a model rather than actual lion counts, and so it is possible that the rate of decline of the African lion population may be lower.  A group exercise led by WCS and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group estimated that 42% of major lion populations were declining (Bauer 2008).  The rate of decline is most unlikely to have been as high as 90%, as reported in a series of news reports in 2003 (Kirby 2003, Frank and Parker 2003).<br/><br/>Genetic population models indicate that large populations (50-100 lion prides) are necessary to conserve genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding, which increases significantly when populations fall below 10 prides.  Male dispersal is also an important factor in conserving genetic variation (Bjorklund 2003).  These conditions are met in few wild lion populations, although there are at least 17 lion ""strongholds"" &gt;50,000 km² in extent (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> occurs as an isolated single wild population in India's Gir Forest.  The Gir lion population had been reduced to a very low number in the early years of the 20th century, possibly fewer than 20.  In 1936, 234 lions were estimated, falling to approximately 100 iin the 1970s, and estimates in the 1980s and 1990s around 200 adults (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In 2005,  the population was estimated at 359, +/- 10, including cubs, based on, according to the Chief Minister of Forests for Gujarat state, a total count of lions by direct sighting in a block-system methodology.  This is an increase from 327 reported in 2001 (Anon. 2006).  The Wildlife Protection Society of India reported 34 lion deaths in 2007, due to poaching, electrocution, falling into open wells, and death by motor vehicle and unknown causes.  Single populations are vulnerable to extinction from catastrophic events, and it has long been recommended by scientists to establish a second wild population in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, but this has not yet been done (Jackson 2008).  The Asiatic lion shows reduced genetic variation due to small population size (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 1987).  It is feared that the size of the population is larger than the estimated carrying capacity of the habitat and prey base (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",,"Lions are found in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  In 2005-2006 the Wildlife Conservation Society and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map and assess current lion range in sub-Saharan Africa (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008).  Extent of occurrence is estimated at over 4.5 million km², 22% of historical range.  Most lion range is in eastern and southern Africa (77%).  Current lion status is still unknown over large parts of Africa, 7.6 million km².  <br/><br/>The lion formerly ranged from northern Africa through southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Today, the only remainder of this once widespread population is a single isolated population of the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer in press).",,Terrestrial,"<em>P. leo</em> is included in CITES Appendix II; the Critically Endangered Asiatic lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> is included in CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Africa, lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for lions in west and central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and eastern and southern Africa (IUCN 2006b).  The West and Central African Lion Conservation Strategy focuses on three primary objectives to address threats that directly impact lions:  to reduce lion-human conflict, and to conserve and increase lion habitat and wild prey base.  The objectivs of the Eastern and Southern African Lion Conservation Strategy are aarticulated around the root issues in lion conservation, including policy and land use, socio-economics, trade, and conservation politics.  For example, the policy and land use objective is ""to develop and implement harmonious and comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks that provide for the expansion of wildife-integrated land use, lion conservation and associated socio-economic benefits in current and potential lion range.""  The trade objective is ""to prevent illegal trade in lions and lion products while promoting and safegarding sustainable legal trade.""  Both regional strategies share common priorities of conserving and restoring lion populations, improving managemetn capacity, and increasing the flow of benefits to communities living with lions.  These strategies should be used by governments to guide national lion action plans, policies and programs, and by the conservation community to guide their project development.  By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>For the Asiatic lion, resolving human lion-conflict is a high priority, as well as establishing a second wild population (Jackson 2008).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

During a five month study during 1993 in suitable habitat in Israel only eight squirrels were encountered at two different sites. This number was considered low.

The species has proven to be extremely difficult to locate in the wild, making estimates of population trends difficult. While one may expect a broadly distributed species with confirmed occurrences in fragmented or altered habitat to have a generally stable population,&#160;preliminary evidence from the field suggests that these areas may alter the Bush Dog’s ecological requirements resulting in an increase in the minimum area needed to support a group (and thereby putting the species at increased risk of either direct or indirect exposure to other threats). The species is here listed as Near Threatened based on an estimated decline of 20–25% in the past 12 years (estimated generation length = 4 years), thereby approximating the threshold for listing as Vulnerable under criterion A2. This decline is attributable to multiple threats, including ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, reduction in prey abundance due to illegal hunting and predation by domestic dogs, and an increased risk from canid-related disease.","<p>Bush Dogs are reported to be a habitat generalist by indigenous peoples, within the context of occurring generally near water sources, particularly small streams, where prey densities may be higher (Zuercher <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005; E.S.

Observations have also been recorded from cerrado habitat in Brazil (Silveira et al. 1998; Oliveira 2009, C.

With the latter, 13 of 15 individuals in a large family group suddenly died from severe haemorrhagic enteritis when they contracted Campylobacter from an infected Coati that they were inadvertently fed (L. Saboia pers. comm.). This loss of multiple animals in a short period emphasizes both the species sensitivity to various diseases and the susceptibility of group living species to pathogens. With increasing proximity to human areas and intrusion into protected areas with hunting dogs, the risk of exposure to disease is potentially high.&#160;Exposure to disease may also result from feral or semi-feral, non-vaccinated, domestic dogs that regularly hunt prey independent of humans (K.

The species is seldom recorded with camera traps; however, caution should be taken when interpreting the lack of detection, as this may actually be associated with the species actively avoiding features associated with this technique (e.g., placement of traps along animal trails used by other carnivores) or assumptions on animal movement (e.g., placement along roads assumes the animal will walk along the road versus cross over the road).<br/></p>  <p>Demographic data for Bush Dogs are lacking throughout their range and population estimates have been reported only for a few areas: &lt;100 in Misiones Argentina (DeMatteo 2008), &gt;1,000 in Bolivia (DeMatteo 2008), &gt; 1,000 in 4,022 km²<sup></sup> or one individual/4 km²<sup></sup> in Cusco Peru within the Camisea River region (DeMatteo 2008), 0.04 individuals/km²<sup></sup> (B.

Populations fluctuate significantly. Population decreases are dramatic, caused by catastrophic climatic events, and numbers can drop tenfold within the space of a single year. Corsac foxes have the ability to forego water and food for extended periods of time. They are well adapted to a hot and dry climate. Current population status, and the nature of major threats, is unknown in most regions. However, the species is not considered threatened at present.","The corsac typically inhabits steppes, semi-deserts and deserts, avoiding mountains, forested areas and dense bush. In the western part of the range they occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall grass steppes. In Kaspyi Sea region the steppes and tarragon-cereal semi-deserts are favoured. It also occurs in fixed-sand habitats (Nogaiskaya Steppe). In Volgo-Ural watershed the corsac inhabits most usual habitats, but prefers semi-deserts. To the east of the Ural Mountains, the species inhabits steppes and in favourable years occurs even in forested steppes. In Kazakhstan typical habitats are low grass steppes and semi-deserts, often inhabiting low hills, but avoiding low mountains. In Middle-Asia it inhabits semi-deserts and ephemeral-deserts, avoiding drifting sands. One limiting factor is snow height in winter, and this species avoids areas where the depth of snow exceeds 150 mm, preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed.<br/><br/>Corsac foxes appear to depend on distribution of ground squirrels and marmots for food and shelter (the burrows being enlarged and used for refuge).","Development in Kazakhstan in the mid-1850s caused a significant reduction of corsac numbers in previously undisturbed habitats. In the 20th century several catastrophic population declines were recorded. During such crashes hunting on corsac foxes in the former Soviet Union was banned. For example, hunting of corsac foxes was stopped within the entire Kazakhstan territory from 1928 to 1938. Current population status, and the nature of major threats, is unknown in most regions. The western part of the range populations are recovering and their range expanding. In Kalmikiya large desert areas are changing into grass steppes, less suitable for corsac foxes. In Middle Asia and Kazakhstan a dramatic decrease of livestock during the last decade influenced many ecosystems and wildlife populations. However, the exact influence of this process on corsac populations remains unknown.<br/><br/>Corsac pelts have been intensively traded. In general, over much of Russia during the 19th century, as many as 40,000–50,000 corsac pelts were traded in some years. For the time being, corsac pelts are not as highly appreciated as red fox pelts, and corsac foxes are usually trapped only incidentally.","Corsac populations fluctuate significantly. Population decreases are dramatic, caused by catastrophic climatic events, and numbers can drop tenfold within the space of a single year. On the other hand, in favourable years numbers can increase by the same margin and more within a three to four year period. Corsac foxes have the ability to forego water and food for extended periods of time. They are well adapted to a hot and dry climate. Current population status is unknown in most regions. Dramatic population changes were reported during the last century in PredKavkazie, between Kuma and Terek rivers and in Kuma-Manich Channel region. A drastic population decline was reported at the beginning of the last century (Dinnik 1914). Numbers had recovered by 1924 to 1925; one hunter during that time could take up to 15–30 corsac foxes in one season (Ognev 1931). By 1931 numbers decreased again with a subsequent increase in 1951 (Verezhagin 1959). In the Ural region during particular years up to 5,500 animals were taken by trappers, and up to 1,700 in the Gurievskaya region. To the south, in Mangishlak and Ustyurt, the corsac is widespread and in some years abundant. In Russia the corsac is rare in most regions, but common in West Siberia and Transbaikalie. It sometimes occurs in northern parts of West Siberia's forested steppes, but in low numbers. The species is common everywhere between the Volga and Ural rivers. In Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and northern China, the corsac is common or abundant, although in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is usually rare. Population status in Afghanistan and Iran is unknown.",Unknown,"Narrower than the historical range and includes two parts. The first covers the Middle Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, as well as steppe and forest-steppe areas of Russia, including the southern region of Western Siberia. In Europe its range reaches the Samara Region, Tatarstan to the North and northern Caucasia to the South. The second, much smaller area lies in southern Transbaikalye representing the northern periphery of the Mongolian and Manchurian section of the species area. Outside Russia the species area includes the steppe part of north-eastern China, including Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and the region between Argun and Big Khingan, the entire Mongolian republic except for its forested and mountain regions, Dgungaria, Kashgaria, Afghanistan (probably only northern) and north-eastern Iran. Southern limit of distribution is unknown, but possibly it reaches to the mountain ridges separating the Tibet Highland from the North. Thus, the two ranges (western and eastern) are connected by a relatively narrow neck in the Dgungar Gate and Zaisan Basin region. In recent years a westward area expansion has been recorded, particularly into the Voronezh region following active recovery of baibak (<em>Marmota bobak</em>) populations. Occasionally, the species is recorded from the Ukrainian steppe (as far as Pavlodar to the West), eastern Transcaucasia (Azerbaijan) and, probably, western Kyrgyzstan.",,Terrestrial,"Corsac foxes are protected in strict nature reserves (the highest protection status for the territory) and in national parks in China, Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia.<br/><br/>Not listed on CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>Listed in some regional Red books in Russia: Bashkir (Volga tribute) and Buryat (Transbaikalia region) with category III status (species with declining populations).<br/><br/>Hunting of corsac foxes is regulated by special national legislation, in which the species is considered a fur-bearer species (Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia).

Red Foxes are adaptable and opportunistic omnivores and are capable of successfully occupying urban areas. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with man, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. The species currently is not under threat.","Red Foxes have been recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert and forest, as well as in city centres (including London, Paris, Stockholm, etc.). Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with abundant ""edge"" of scrub and woodland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains (even above the treeline, known to cross alpine passes), deserts, sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4,500 m. In the UK, they generally prefer mosaic patchworks of scrub, woodland and farmland. Red foxes flourish particularly well in urban areas. They are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing and are less common where industry, commerce or council rented housing predominates (Harris and Smith 1987). In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with man, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas.","The main threats include habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation, and exploitation, and direct and indirect persecution. However, the Red Fox's versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. There are currently bounties on subspecies <em>V. v. pusilla</em> (desert foxes) in Pakistan to protect game birds such as Houbara bustards (<em>Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii</em>), with a high hunting value.<br/><br/>The number of foxes raised for fur (although much reduced since the 1900s) exceeds that of any other species, except possibly mink (<em>Mustela vison</em>) (Obbard 1987). Types farmed are particularly colour variants (""white"", ""silver"" and ""cross"") that are rare in the wild. <br/><br/>Worldwide trade in ranched red fox pelts (mainly ""silver"" pelts from Finland) was 700,000 in 1988-1989 (excluding internal consumption in the USSR). Active fur trade in Britain in 1970s was negligible.","Red Fox density is highly variable. In the UK, density varies between one fox per 40 km² in Scotland and 1.17/km² in Wales, but can be as high as 30 foxes per km² in some urban areas where food is superabundant (Harris 1977; Macdonald and Newdick 1982; Harris and Rayner 1986). Social group density is one family per km² in farmland, but may vary between 0.2-5 families per km² in the suburbs and as few as a single family per 10 km² in barren uplands (Macdonald 1981; Lindsay and Macdonald 1986). Fox density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is three foxes per km² (Meia 1994). In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, they occur at densities of 0.1/km², and in southern Ontario, Canada at 1/km² (Voigt 1987). The average social group density in the Swiss mountains is 0.37 family per km² (Weber <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The pre-breeding British fox population totals an estimated 240,000 (Harris <em>et al.</em> 1995). Mean number of foxes killed per unit area by gamekeepers has increased steadily since the early 1960s in 10/10 regional subdivisions of Britain, but it is not clear to what extent this reflects an increase in fox abundance. Although an increase in fox numbers following successful rabies control by vaccination was widely reported in Europe (e.g., fox bag in Germany has risen from 250,000 in 1982-1983 to 600,000 in 2000-2001), no direct measures of population density have been taken.",Stable,"Distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central America, and the Asiatic steppes, the Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million km²).

Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the European Union, Canada, and the Russian Federation, trapping methods are regulated under an agreement on international trapping standards between these countries, which was signed in 1997. Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the UK and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained ""use"" may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport&#160;<em>–</em>&#160;the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint&#160;<em>–</em>&#160;hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs. This type of fox hunting may also be perceived as a sport by its participants. <br/><br/>An individual deciding whether or not to control foxes, and by what means, has a complex set of factors to consider, including other interest groups, practicality and economics. For some farmers, there is evidence that a decision to control foxes may be economically perverse. Macdonald <em>et al</em>. (2003) modelled the interactions between foxes, rabbits, and rabbit-induced crop damage. For some farmers at least, a decision to kill a fox may, in some circumstances, cost that farmer a significant amount of crop loss to the rabbits that the fox and its descendants would have killed.<br/><br/>In addition to fur farms, Red Foxes are widely kept in small wildlife parks and zoos, but there appears to be no systematic data on their breeding success.

Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006). The causes of decline of the Novaya Zemlya subspecies <em>pearsoni </em>are not known (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006). Loss of habitat in Finland (through logging) may pose problems, and there is increased disturbance to the species in some areas due to winter sporting activities. Hybridization with semidomesticated reindeer is a potential problem for some subspecies and subpopulations (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006, Ruusila and Kojola in press).","There are approximately 30,000 wild reindeer in southern Norway and 10,000 in Svalbard (Andersen and Hustad 2004). The population trend in Norway is believed to be stable, and hunting is controlled. In Finland, forest reindeer (subspecies <em>R. t. fennicus</em>) were driven extinct in the early 1900s, but are now starting to recover as a result of animals moving in from Karelia in Russia and from some captive bred stock that were released (Ruusila and Kojola in press). Forest Reindeer remain very rare in Finland (about 1,200 in the eastern subpopulation and 1,000 individuals in the western subpopulation). The Finnish population trend is difficult to determine, as the population in eastern Finland has expanded rapidly from c. 40 reintroduced individuals in 1980 to c.1,200 today, whereas the western subpopulation has declined from c.1,800 to c.1,000 during 2001-2006 (although in the last few years prior to 2001 it had been increasing) (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006, Ruusila and Kojola in press). Overall, the current Finnish population trend is one of growth rather than decline.  Numbers in European Russia are very low with presumed ongoing declines, and the reindeer is now absent from large tracts of tundra and taiga.

Although it is declining in some parts of its European and global range, the bulk of the population is found in the Alps and is relatively secure. Consequently it is classed as Least Concern. However, several chamois subspecies qualify as globally threatened, and require urgent conservation action.","Alpine chamois inhabit steep, rocky areas in the mountains, utilising a variety of habitats including alpine meadows, open rocky areas, mixed broadleaf woodland, and coniferous woodland (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). They feed on grasses and herbs, and on the leaves of trees (Sägesser and Krapp 1986).","Poaching and over-hunting may be a problem for the species in parts of its range, especially where it occurs outside protected areas and private hunting reserves (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Many of the less numerous subspecies (e.g. <em>R. r. balcanica</em>, <em>R. r. cartusiana</em>, and <em>R. r. tatrica</em>) are threatened by the deliberate introduction of subspecies from other geographic areas (especially <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>), leading to hybridisation and genetic swamping (Shackleton 1997). Human disturbance, particularly as a result of increased tourism and leisure activities in mountain areas, may also be a problem (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Competition with domestic livestock and introduced species such as the mouflon <em>Ovis aries</em> is a threat to the more vulnerable subspecies, although it is not considered to be a major problem for <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>. <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> does, however, suffer periodic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, causing local population declines (Shackleton 1997). In 2006 a new disease, pestivirus, was first recorded in this subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In general, habitat loss is not a major threat to the species, as much of its range falls within protected areas. However, habitat loss may be a problem in some areas (e.g. for subspecies <em>balcanica </em>in Albania) (Shackleton 1997). Because its population is very small indeed, subspecies <em>cartusiana </em>is susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic demographic or environmental events (Shackleton 1997, S.

Although declines have been reported in some areas, it is not believed to approach the criteria for listing in a more threatened category.","<em>Lepus europaeus</em> is a highly adaptable species that can persist in any number of habitat types (Flux and Angermann 1990).  There is a positive association with hare abundance and habitat density and diversity (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005).  When available, weeds and wild grasses are selected by L. europaeus; however, intensified agro-practices have reduced this food source resulting in the selection of crop species (Reichlin <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>L. europaeus</em> averages three litters/yr, but can vary from one to four litters/yr (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).  Litter size can vary with respect to the season, smaller litters produced earlier in the season and larger litters later (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).  The birth weight of <em>L. europaeus</em> is approximately 100 g (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).  Gestation is 41-42 days and reproduction occurs year round (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).  Average life expectancy for this hare is 1.04 years, with a maximum age span in the wild of 12.5 years recorded in Poland (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).  Females reach maturity around seven to eight months and male at six months (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). The total length of L. europaeus is 48.0-70.0 cm (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).","A study, reviewing available literature regarding population densities in connection with habitat that was identified as primarily farmland from 12 European countries, concluded that the primary cause of <em>Lepus europaeus</em> decline was intensification of agriculture (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005).  It is inferred that this threat is pertinent to the species across its geographic range where farming is practiced.  Smith <em>et al</em>. (2005) also identified negative associations with predation and precipitation in respect to abundance.  However, ""Field size, temperature, precipitation, and hunting had no effect on density throughout Europe"" (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2005).  L. europaeus is susceptible to localized extinction when hare densities become too low (Soule 1987).  In Greece, the restocking of hares has been identified as a threat to regional gene pools (Mamuris <em>et al</em>. 2001).  This issue has also been identified as a concern for the Cantabric population in Spain (Palacios <em>et al</em>. 2004).  Disease is an additional threat to L. europaeus and several have been identified as the principle sources of mortality (Lamarque <em>et al</em>. 1996). These diseases are European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS), Pasteurellosis, Yersiniosis (Pseudo-tuberculosis), Coccidiosis and tularaemia (Lamarque <em>et al</em>. 1996).<br/><br/>Genetic diversity of <em>L. europaeus</em> in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany indicates that hare populations still retain sufficient diversity (Fickel <em>et al</em>. 2005).  However, it is cautioned that restricted gene flow could eventually lead to allelic fixation and inbreeding depression within populations that become isolated (Fickel <em>et al</em>. 2005).","Populations of <em>Lepus europaeus</em> have been experiencing declines in many areas across its geographic range in Europe (Flux and Angermann 1990).  Population densities range from 0.1/ha to 3.4/ha (Flux and Angermann 1990). <br/><br/>A study conducted in the Czech Republic found mean hare densities were highest in habitat with the following characteristics (Pikula <em>et al.</em> 2004): elevation: sea level to 200 m (231.47/10 sq. km); annual snow cover duration: 40-60 days (183.95/10 sq. km); mean annual precipitation: 450-700 mm (174.71/10 sq. km); annual sunshine duration: 1801-2000 (169.72/10 sq. km); mean annual air temperature: &gt;10.0°C (245.00/10 sq. km); and Pikula <em>et al.</em> (2004) states the highest mean densities with respect to climatic areas was in: ""A warm and dry district with mild winter and longer duration of sunshine; a warm and dry district with mild winter and shorter duration of sunshine; a warm and moderately dry district with mild winter"" (227.91/10 sq. km) (Pikula <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Decreasing,"The current Eurasian distribution of <em>Lepus europaeus</em> extends from the northern provinces of Spain, to introduced populations in the United Kingdom and southern regions of Scandinavia, south to northern portions of the Middle East, and has naturally expanded east to sections of Siberia (Flux and Angermann 1990).

There are concerns about loss of prey, persecution, loss of suitable habitat, etc. Hence the species is listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies under Criterion A4. The assessment is not adjusted because it is difficult to say if there would be a rescue effect or not and likewise it is unknown if the European population is a sink or not.","A generalist, it is found in almost every type of lowland habitat. It is often found in lowland woods in riparian zones, and in areas close to farms and villages in the winter; but it also uses wooded steppe, sand dunes, marshes and river valleys, agricultural land, forest edge and mosaic habitats (Birks 1999, Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). Mountainous areas are avoided. It feeds on live rodents (voles, mice, hamsters) and other vertebrates, also sometimes on invertebrates and carrion. In wetland areas it often feeds on amphibians (Birks 1999).","In western and central Europe, it was formerly widely hunted for sport and fur and persecuted as a pest, although this threat has become less serious as the species is now protected in a number of range states and rates of hunting have greatly reduced (Birks 1999). Accidental mortality in car collisions and via secondary rodenticide poisoning is a problem (Birks 1999, Battersby 2005). Declines in prey species, e.g. hamsters (Nechay 2000) and rabbits in southern Iberia (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005) may contributing to declines in parts of the range.

Population trends are poorly known; although generally the population trend appears to have stabilized in recent years owing to better protection, it is possible that there is a slow continuing decline as persecution continues in some areas. In the western part of the region remnant populations are tiny, isolated, and under severe threat. Consequently this species is classed as Vulnerable (C2a(i)). The assessment is not adjusted because there is little interchange with populations outside the region. If better information shows that the overall trend is stable or increasing, reassessment should be considered.</p>    <p>Details of the Mediterranean populations are given below:<br/></p><p>1. Cantabrian.</p><p>The two Cantabrian populations apparently have been separated since the beginning of the century and now show genetic differences. Today, they are separated by 30-50 km of mountainous terrain and interchange between the populations is thought to be unlikely, mainly due to unsuitable habitat and a high speed railway and motorway. In the Western Cantabrian Mountains the population seems to be stable or increasing in the last decade and is distributed over an area of 2,600 km2. The most recent estimate using genetic methods (García-Garitagoitia et al. 2004) calculated 85-143 bears for the western nucleus, with an average number of 107. In the Eastern Cantabrian Mountains (20 bears) the population shows less potential for recovery, unless the corridor with the western portion is re-established. The total population for both Cantabrian nuclei may be approximately 100-150 bears; not all of these are mature individuals. <br/> <br/> 2. Pyrenees<br/> The autochthonous western population was estimated to be 3 individuals. The last documented reproductions occurred in 1995 and 1998. In 2006 the reintroduction action provided 5 (4F, 1M) bears from Slovenia mostly to central area. The autochthonous central population was gone before the last decade of 20th century. In 1996-1997 three bears were reintroduced from Slovenia. There was subsequent reproduction, including one male dispersal to Western  Pyrenees. Until recently the Western and Central  Pyrenees were treated as separate units. With the dispersal of one male bear from the central to the west portion the connectivity is now reastablished. The local bears have been totally isolated for over one century and had low genetic diversity. The recent reintroductions have resulted in the influx of new genes.<br/> <br/> 3. Alps<br/> The Central Austrian subpopulation now consists of about &lt;10 bears. After increases following reintroductions and local reproductions, in recent years numbers have declined again. No more than 4 autochthonous bears survived in north-eastern Italy until 10 were reintroduced from Slovenia in 1999-2003. With subsequent reproduction the population has exceeded 20 bears, and continues to grow; in 2006 a population of about 6-7 adults and 16-17 sub-adults and cubs was recorded. <br/> <br/> At least three individuals from the Trentino nuclei dispersed into Austria, Switzerland and Germany. None of them became established, but this demonstrated the connectivity of the habitat within the Alps and the potential for recolonization. One bear was legally shot in Germany in July 2006 because of the potential threat it posed to human safety (the bear repeatedly entered villages and broke into barns), whereas the other two bears disappeared without leaving any tracks. Occasionally individuals dispersing from the Eastern Alpine nucleus have reached the Central Italian Alps, confirming a potential connectivity among all the alpine nuclei.<br/> <br/> 4. Appenine Mountains<br/> An estimate yielded a figure of 70-80 bears in 1985. However, since then there has probably been a population decrease and 40-50 bears may be a more realistic estimate. Some expect this population to increase as poaching has been reduced in recent years, and areas surrounding Abruzzo National Park have been protected to secure suitable habitats. However, this population exists within a densely human populated area and there are potential conflicts between bear conservation and development and recreation activities.<br/> <br/> 5. Dinara-Pindos<br/> The population seems to be genetically very close to the remnant bears in the Alps. The population overall has been more or less stable in recent years. However, trends vary in different areas, with steady growth in Slovenia and Croatia, a marked drop in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s due to the war, and probably stable or slightly decreasing trends in the south of the Dinarids, whereas in Pindos range it is characterized as stable (150-200) with locally positive trends and recolonization of former range. The population size estimate of 2,800 is based on weak supporting evidence. Approximately half (1,400) of these individuals are mature, and the population is divided into subpopulations with each numbering less than 1,000 individuals. The population trend data is likewise based on little quantitative data and it is possible that the trend is declining rather than stable. In countries with bear hunting there might be a political tendency for overestimation to justify higher quotas. In Slovenia in the north this population is close to that of the Alps. There is not a continuous distribution of female bears in the Alps, but there is movement of male bears. In Greece in the south the nearest bears are those of the Rila-Rhodope portion of the Balkan population along the border of Greece and Bulgaria, but there is no evidence of connection.<br/> <br/> 6. Balkan<br/> It consists of two segments: Rila-Rhodope Mountains (520 bears) and Stara Planina  Mountains (200 bears). Little is known about genetic structure. The connections between subpopulations were recently proven, and there may be signs of recolonization. In the early eighties Carpathian bears were released in Rhodope and Stara Planina  Mountains. The numbers are not known since there is restricted access to this data.</p>      <p>7. Anatolian</p><p>The population numbers a few hundreds. The population trend has stabilized as a result of strict protection.&#160; </p>","Brown bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests.  Their range overlaps that of both the American and Asiatic black bear (<em>U. americanus</em>, <em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the polar bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>).  Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m asl (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items.  In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004).  In North America, brown (grizzly) bears are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006).<br/><br/>The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats.  Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;10 bears per 100 km²) of brown bears (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al</em>. 1999).  Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al</em>. 2001).  More moderate densities of bears occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al</em>. 2003), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available.  Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al</em>. 2005).  Lower densities are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most such areas (e.g., northern India, western China, Mongolia) density estimates are not available.<br/><br/>Breeding occurs during May to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn.  Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or more), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating.  In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every 3 or 4 years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al</em>. 2003).  In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Frković <em>et al</em>. 2001).","Although, as a whole, this species is secure, with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, several small, isolated populations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans.  These small populations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development.  As wide-ranging omnivores, brown bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence.  Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006).  Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions) or poached for parts or products: even small numbers of bears removed from small populations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al</em>. 1998, Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Even where brown bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes at unsustainable rates.  Estimates of sustainable exploitation rates are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size.  Many countries do not have the resources to develop, implement, or enforce adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for brown bears.  Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal take may equal or exceed the legal take.  This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006).<br/><br/>In addition to direct removal of brown bears, many human activities such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric developments, and human settlements eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 2005, Waller and Servheen 2005).  Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 2004).  With increasing human populations, the value of brown bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007).","The total world population of brown bears is estimated to exceed 200,000.  Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1997, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Bellemain <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2005), but few areas in Asia.  Russia has the largest number of brown bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 14,000.  <br/><br/>Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small populations.  In North America, the southern fringe has isolated populations ranging in size from over 500 in and around Yellowstone National Park (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005) to approximately 15 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 2004).  <br/><br/>In southern Europe there are several extremely small, isolated populations: two populations in the Pyrenees (France and Spain) each have &lt;10 bears, two populations in the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain) contain 20-30 and 80-100 bears, a population in the Appenine Mountains (Italy) has 40-50 bears, and the Alps (Italy, Austria, and Slovenia) has 35-40 bears (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000; http://www.largecarnivores.maverik.ch/bear-ois/index.htm).  <br/><br/>Small populations of brown bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but little is known of numbers or connectivity.  In Pakistan there are an estimated 150–200 bears in seven separate populations in the Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush Ranges, only one of which has more than 20 individuals (Nawaz 2007).  In India, brown bears exist in 23 protected areas in the northern states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttaranchal, but they are regarded as fairly common in only two of these; country-wide there are likely &lt;1,000 individuals, and possibly half that (Sathyakumar 2006).  In China, brown bears exist is sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006).  A more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,000+ brown bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006).",Stable,"The brown bear is the most widely distributed ursid.  It once ranged across a large portion of North America, including northern Mexico (plus, at one time, much of the eastern half of the continent), throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and even across North Africa.  It presently occupies approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 800,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia.  The largest numbers exist in Russia, U.S. (Alaska), and Canada.  Many populations in Europe, and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000).  A history of prolonged over-exploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries.  The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998).  During the 20th Century, brown bears (called grizzly bears in interior North America) were extirpated in Mexico and a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), while in Asia and the Middle East they have apparently been eliminated from Syria, and possibly Bhutan.  Very small numbers of brown bears still remain in Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006).  Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees.  A few wandering individuals recently crossed into Switzerland from Italy and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered extant populations.<br/><br/>The brown bear currently occurs in Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra (recently reoccupied), Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan (possibly extinct), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic (possibly only vagrants), Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Greece, India, Iraq, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United States, and Uzbekistan. The species has become Extinct during past 500 years in Algeria, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, Palestinian Territory (Occupied), Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland, and Syrian Arab Republic. Extinctions due to human agency have taken place more than 500 years ago in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Jordan, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Tunisia, United Kingdom, and the Vatican.",,Terrestrial,"Conservation actions for brown bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations.  Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal.  Hunting regulations designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits, a quota system, and restricted season length.  <br/><br/>Most small populations are legally protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement.  All international trade in brown bears is restricted by either CITES I (in parts of central Asia) or CITES II.  In parts of the U.S., small populations of grizzly bears have successfully rebounded under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions and population augmentations also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S. and Western Europe (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1994, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2002).  <br/><br/>There are numerous protected areas around the world with brown bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, brown bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2006).  Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on brown bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or nonexistent (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zedrosser <em>et al</em>. 2001).",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

It is found in a variety of habitats. In Europe, it prefers broadleaved forests and especially evergreen oak forests, but may also be found in more open habitats such as steppe, mediterranean shrubland, and farmland, so long as there is water and tree cover nearby (Spitz 1999). In Europe it is found from sea level to 2,400 in the Pyrenees (Palomo and Gisbert 2002), but it can be found at higher elevations in Asia.<br/><br/>The species is omnivorous, though stomach and fecal contents analyses indicate that vegetable matter, principally fruits, seeds, roots and tubers, constitutes about 90% of the diet (Spitz, 1986). A field study of the Indonesian wild pig, <em>S. s. vittatus,/i&gt;, in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, indicated that these animals are predominately frugivorous, feeding on about 50 species of fruits, especially those of strangling figs (<em>Ficus</em> spp.), and that they are important seed dispersal agents (Pauwels, 1980). By comparison, analyses of the stomach contents of wild pigs (also <em>S. s. vittatus</em>) in agricultural areas of West Malaysia by Diong (1973), revealed that sugar cane, tapioca and rice were the commonest food items, but that usually more than one type of food had been eaten, even where a single cultivated crop was abundant. Other items commonly consumed by these pigs included soil, earthworms, roots and other vegetable matter and, in mangrove areas, molluscs, crabs and other arthropods and even fishes. The consumption of invertebrate and small vertebrate prey may be a necessary component of the diet, since a study of free-ranging domestic pigs in Papua New Guinea revealed that animals fed <em>ad libitum</em> lost weight when denied earthworms (Rose and Williams, 1983). In common with its feral derivatives (Oliver and Brisbin, 1993), <em>S. scrofa</em> has also occasionally been reported to predate larger vertebrates, such as deer fawns and (tethered) goats (Hoogerwerf, 1970), though it is possible that such incidents involve only a few individuals in the population; an aspect also noted by Pauwels (1980) when referring to the predation of sea turtle nests by wild pigs in Ujung Kulon. Similarly, a large boar (<em>S. s. cristatus</em>) in Royal Chitawan National Park, Nepal, which was seen to displace an adult leopard from its kill, a domestic buffalo calf, which it then partly consumed (W. Oliver, pers. obs.), was reported by Park staff to regularly commandeer such kills, but that no other individual pigs had been seen to do this.<br/><br/>Wild pigs are normally most active in the early morning and late afternoon, though they become nocturnal in disturbed areas, where activity usually commences shortly before sunset and continues throughout the night. A total of 4 to 8 hours are spent foraging or traveling to feeding areas. Feeding is generally a social activity (even solitary males may join feeding groups) which also provides an opportunity for display and other agonistic behaviours (Beuerle, 1975). Radio telemetry studies in southern France indicate that they generally travel between 2 and 15 km per night, though this is often within an area of only 20 to 150 ha. However, the home range estimates for adult females and adult males over a 2-3 month period varied from 500-1,000 ha and 1,000-2,000 ha, respectively. During this same period, subadults covered an area of 500- 5,000 ha, and after 6 to 12 months they may have covered more than 10,000 ha; the larger home ranges of these animals being related to their expulsion from their natal groups and then undergoing a wandering phase. Movements over long distances (50 to 250 km) have also been recorded in Europe, but the extent and purpose of these movements has yet to be studied (Spitz, 1986). Experiments in which tagged animals are released and subsequently recovered provide evidence that they disperse freely over even larger areas (500 to 750 km²), which may also indicate the area occupied by large population units. The density of free-ranging <em>S. s. scrofa</em> in Europe rarely exceeds 5 individuals/km² (Spitz, 1986), though much higher concentrations have been reported elsewhere, e.g. 27-32/km² on Peucang Island in Ujung Kulon National Park, Java (Pauwels, 1980) and 32.2-72.1/km² in sugarcane areas in the Punjab, Pakistan (Shafi and Khokhar, 1985). <br/><br/>Wild pigs are gregarious, forming herds or 'sounders' of varying size depending on locality and season, but usually of between 6-20 individuals, though aggregations of over 100 have been reported (Prater, 1971; Legakul and McNeely, 1977; Briedermann, 1990)). The basic social unit is a nucleus of one or more females and their last litters. Animals peripheral to this comprise subadults from previous litters, and adult males during the mating season. However, the latter tend to stay in relatively close contact with 1 or 2 female groups at other times of the year, and subadult males or mixed sex groups of subadults may also form longer-term associations (Spitz and Janeau, 1990). The dynamics of the basic group include the isolation of the preparturient female, her re-entry with young, entry of nulliparous females, the arrival of adult males with the simultaneous departure of subadult animals (Spitz, 1986). In contrast to its domestic derivatives, reproductive activity in <em>S. scrofa</em> tends to be seasonal and positively correlated with the relative availability of principal foodstuffs or related climatic factors. In tropical countries, such as Sri Lanka, peak estrus activity has been recorded during the wettest months of November and December (Santiapillai and Chambers, 1980). However, social organization may also play a role in modulating the timing of reproductive events, since farrowing is often synchronized amongst females in the same social groups, which suggests a mechanism for synchronizing the onset of estrus (Spitz, 1986).<br/><br/>Wide fluctuations in the numbers of animals killed by hunters, particularly in the (former) U.S.S.R. and in France, suggest cyclic changes in the numbers of wild pigs available for hunting. Annual recruitment into the total population depends on reproductive rate (i.e. the number and prolificacy of females) and juvenile mortality, both of which factors may be influenced by the availability of foodstuffs and other external factors (Spitz, 1986). In western Europe, litter size is usually between 4 and 7 piglets (Briedermann, 199), though Harrison and Bates (1991) cite reports of 5 and 7-10 piglets per litter as being usual in Iraq and Armenia, respectively. Pauwels (1980) recorded an average litter size of 6-10 piglets at the beginning of the breeding season in Java, but this number dropped to only 2-4 piglets per litter towards the end of the breeding season. In the Ryukyu Islands, S. Japan, there is evidence that the wild pigs (<em>S. s. riukiuanus</em>) have two breeding seasons per year, though it remains uncertain whether individual sows normally produce litters twice a year (Yasuma, 1984). Juvenile mortality averages 15% in the first three months in western Europe, though between 50% and 75% mortality have been reported by the end of the first year of life (Jezierski, 1977; Briedermann, 1990). These mortality rates are thought to be highly dependant on such external factors as predation and climatic hazards, at least in wilderness areas (Spitz, 1986). Similarly, Pauwel (1982) suggested that the principal causes of juvenile mortality in wild pigs in Ujung Kulon were predation (particularly as a consequence of the accidental separation of infants from their mothers), along with differences in the relative rate of development of litter-mates and various parasite-related causes. These factors resulted in only about 15% of all progeny surviving to independence.</em>","At a global level, there are no major threats to the species. However, there are many threats at a more local level, principally habitat destruction and hunting pressure, either for food, sport or in reprisal for crop damage, particularly in areas near human habitation. In Afghanistan, Hassinger (1973) cited reports of the decrease in the numbers of wild pigs in the Pul-i-Khumri District in the 1950s as a result of the draining of marshlands for agricultural purposes, and hunting by Europeans; but noted that they were still numerous in other districts where: ""they invade the fields and cause serious damage during the harvest"". In parts of Perak and Johore in West Malaysia, Diong (1973) reported that the numbers of wild pigs (<em>S. s. vittatus</em>) had diminished drastically as a result of increased hunting pressure, particularly for commercial purposes, and that most hunting methods, whether with guns, dogs or snares, was entirely non-selective. Nonetheless, wild pigs are still included in Malaysia's 'Agricultural Pest Ordinance, 1977', on account of their damage to a variety of crops, including sugar cane, tapioca, rice and even coconuts. Lay (1967) also remarked upon the damage to crops by wild pigs in Iran which: ""...brings great wrath upon them, usually ineffectual, from the local farmers"". In Pakistan, the expansion of the sugar cane industry in the 1960s and early 1970s brought about local increases in the numbers of wild pigs (<em>S. s. davidi</em>), whose depredations in the cane fields (estimated at an annual loss rate of Rs.5 million in 1978) led to the development of control measures, including the use of poison baits (Shafi and Khokhar, 1985). <br/><br/>Although actually referring to wild pigs in India, it is clear that Prater's (1971) opinion that: ""No animal is more destructive to crops and, in cultivated areas, it is impossible to make a plea for its protection"", would find popular support in many other countries. In the Ryukyu Islands, S. Japan, the endemic <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> is actively regarded as an environmental pest, and bounties are paid to farmers for killing them by the Japanese Government, despite the fact that this taxon is recognized internationally as being seriously threatened throughout it extremely restricted range (see later text). In various places in Indonesia, most notably in Java, deliberate attempts have been made in the past to eradicate wild pigs altogether by means of organized shooting parties and poisoning campaigns. However, despite many thousands of wild pigs being destroyed in this way, it is clear that this has had little lasting effect on these animals which, according to Hoogerwerf (1970), have: ""remained further removed from extinction than any other species of game in Java"". This situation evidently obtains in a number of other countries, including Viet Nam (R. Ratajszsak pers. comm.) and Taiwan (K. Nowell pers. comm.), where wild pigs are reported to survive in a number of nominally protected areas where all or most of the other principal 'game' species have been eradicated by sustained hunting pressure. <br/><br/>In these and many other (non-Islamic) countries or local communities, wild pigs often constitute the single most important game animal to subsistence and/or recreational hunters. Sport hunting accounts for about 30 to 50% of animals heavier than 20 kg in southern France, though this figure may be as high as 50 to 75% in some heavily populated countries, where hunting remains largely or wholly uncontrolled (Spitz, 1986). For example, the wild pig population inhabiting the 25,000 ha of broadleaved woodlands around Monticiano in Italy, has apparently been able to sustain its numbers despite an annual hunter-kill rate of about 50% (c. 500 animals) of the population (Devitt, 1984). <br/><br/>According to figures produced by the Japanese Environment Agency a total of 1,279,453 (an average of 63,973 per annum) wild pigs were harvested in Japan between 1970 and 1989 (incl.), of which 1,083,858 (85%) were taken by hunters, and the remaining 195,596 were destroyed as crop pests during the closed season. The great majority of these animals are <em>S. s. leucomystax</em> from the main islands of Honshu, Shikoko and Kyushu, and this subspecies is evidently able to withstand high levels of harvesting to judge from contemporary reports of marginal expansions in the overall range of this subspecies (Hanai, 1982; Takahashi, 1980). Unfortunately, however, these totals do not differentiate between the numbers of <em>S. s. leucomystax</em> and those of <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> from the three small islands of Amami Oshima, Tokuno Shima and Kakeroma Jima, which are also included in these figures. As previously indicated, the latter subspecies is declining rapidly in numbers on these islands, and on the neighbouring island of Okinawa, largely as a result of over-hunting (Barber <em>et al</em>., 1984; H. Obara pers. comm.). This conclusion is also borne out by official figures on the annual harvest of <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> from two other islands, Iriomote and Ishigaki, in the Ryukyu chain between 1965 and 1981, which indicate a downward trend in the numbers of these animals (Yasuma, 1984) and a marked increase in the amount of effort required by local hunters to obtain smaller catches (Hanai, 1982). Nonetheless, according to these figures an average of 530 and 190 wild pigs were still being taken annually on Iriomote and Ishigaki, respectively; of which slightly more than 50% were killed as 'agricultural pests', i.e. mostly out of season, often with a Government bounty being paid. Moreover, it is certain that these totals are a serious underestimate - perhaps by as much as 50-100% - of the actual numbers killed, since many hunters operate without licenses and do not declare their catches (Barber <em>et al</em>., 1984; Yasuma, 1984). Formerly, virtually all of these pigs were consumed locally but, following the restoration of electricity (and, hence, refrigeration) in 1972, commercial traders began operating on the islands, and the majority of carcasses are now exported to gourmet markets in Osaka, where they realize relatively high prices and ensure a continued demand for wild-caught meat (Yasuma, 1984). <br/><br/>Wild pigs are also susceptible to a variety of highly contagious diseases which can decimate their populations. Santiapillai <em>et al</em>. (1991) referred to a catastrophic crash in the wild pig population of Ruhuna National Park in Sri Lanka in 1989 owing to an outbreak of swine fever, but that population numbers had apparently recovered by June 1991. Many wild pigs are also reported to have died during an outbreak of disease in the Kanto Region on Honshu Island, Japan in 1877 (Yanagida, 1913). It is possible that this was hog cholera, contracted from domestic pigs which were imported to the region at that time (Chiba, 1975), and this may have been one of the factors contributing to the extirpation of <em>S. s. leucomystax</em> throughout the north of their range on this island. An outbreak of severe skin disease (tentatively identified as sarcoptic mange) on Iriomote, which was first noted in 1976, had spread throughout the Island by 1980, and infected up to 83% of the <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> population according to data based on hunter-killed samples (Yasuma, 1984).<br/><br/>The Ryukyu pigs are also threatened by genetic contamination through contact with free-ranging domesticates. On Ishigaki Island, interbreeding with domestic pigs has been so prevalent that it is doubtful if the remaining wild stock can be considered genetically pure (Obara, 1982). Moreover, it is unlikely that this problem will be confined to Ishigaki, given that the meat from wild x domestic hybrids or 'ino-buta' is popular and local farmers will continue to produce it. Indeed, ino-buta have been farmed commercially on Iriomote for many years, often in poorly controlled conditions. As a result, feral ino-buta have become established on the adjacent, smaller islands of Sotobanare and Uchibanare, and it is claimed that a number of these animals have crossed onto Iriomote at low tide; thereby posing a further, serious threat to the remaining wild stock there (Yasuma, 1984; Takahashi and Tisdell, 1992). <br/><br/>Similarly, Genov <em>et al</em>. (1991) reported that the traditional practice of rearing 'domestic' pigs in semi-wild conditions in Bulgaria has resulted in their hybridizing with the wild boar populations in the eastern and north-eastern parts of that country, and that genetically pure wild boars now occur only in the Rila-Pirin-Rhodopes Mountains in the south of this country, where domestic pigs are not reared in the wild. The principal threat to the survival of the Monticiano population in Italy, lies not so much with the high annual hunter-kill rate but with the fact that the genetic integrity of the native population has been seriously compromised by the introduction of Central European boars after World War II, which have interbred with these animals. Indeed, the introduction of non-native wild pigs, by hunting interest groups in the belief that these were more desirable because of their larger size and reputed greater fecundity, has been so widespread in Italy that the only surviving pure-bred native stock is thought to be in the presidential reserve in Castel Porziano, near Rome (Devitt, 1984).","This species is abundant in many parts of its range, though populations can be depressed in places where hunting intensity is high (for example in eastern and southeastern Asia). Eurasian wild pig populations in Europe increased markedly during the latter part of the 20th century (Spitz 1999), but are now thought to be stable in most areas. Populations in England, southern Sweden and Finland may still be increasing (Battersby 2005). Although there is no global population estimate, numbers can be high in many places. For example, in 1982 in Mongolia, there was a population density of 0.9 per 1,000 ha in the Khovsgol area. By 1989, it was estimated that 34,000 individuals were living in the Khentii and Khangai Mountain regions of Mongolia, with an average density of 1 - 2 per 1,000 ha.",Unknown,"The Eurasian wild pig has one of the widest geographic distributions of all terrestrial mammals, and this range has been greatly expanded by human agency. The species now occurs in pure wild or barely modified feral form on all continents excepting Antarctica, and on many oceanic islands. It is the ancestor of most (but not all) ancient and modern domestic pig breeds, and there is evidence to suggest that it was independently domesticated in several different parts of its range, including Southeast Asia, the Far East and Asia Minor. As a wild form, it has constituted a primary resource of subsistence hunters since the earliest times, and it is one of the most important targets for recreational hunting wherever it remains sufficiently abundant. Over-hunting and changes in land use have resulted in the fragmentation of its range and its extermination throughout the British Isles, Scandinavia, parts of North Africa, and relatively extensive parts of its range in the former Soviet Union. and northern Japan. Nevertheless, the species remains widely distributed and is often locally abundant. As a result of its depredations on crops it is regarded as a pest in many countries, where it remains unprotected outside designated wildlife reserves or is managed as a game animal.<br/><br/><em>S. scrofa</em> has by far the largest range of all pigs. It occurs throughout the steppe and broadleaved forest regions of the Palaearctic, from western Europe to the Russian Far East, extending southwards as far North Africa, the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East, through India, Indo-China, Japan (including the Ryukyu Chain), Taiwan and the Greater Sunda Islands of South-east Asia. Populations east of Bali are probably all introduced. It has been extinct in the British Isles since sometime in the 17th century, despite attempted introductions of new stock from Europe (Harting, 1880) (though see below for more recent information). It is also extinct in southern Scandinavia (but see below), over extensive portions of its recent range in west-central and eastern parts of the former Soviet Union (Heptner <em>et al</em>., 1961), and in northern Japan (Chiba, 1964, 1975). The species was last reported in Libya in the 1880s, and it became extinct in Egypt in about 1902 (Hufnagl, 1972). <br/><br/>Groves and Grubb (1993) distinguished four 'subspecies groupings', based on both geographic and morphological criteria, as follows:<br/><br/>1.  'Western races' of Europe (<em>scrofa</em> and <em>meridionalis</em>), North Africa (<em>algira</em>) and the Middle East (<em>lybicus</em>), extending at least as far east as Soviet Central Asia (<em>attila and nigripes</em>);  <br/><br/>2.  'Indian races' of the sub-Himalayan region from Iran in the west (<em>davidi</em>) to north India and adjacent countries as far east as Myanmar and west Thailand (<em>cristatus</em>), and south India and Sri Lanka (<em>affinis</em> and subsp. nov.); <br/><br/>3.  'Eastern races' of Mongolia and the Soviet Far East (<em>sibiricus</em> and <em>ussuricus</em>), Japan (<em>leucomystax</em> and <em>riukiuanus</em>), Taiwan (<em>taivanus</em>), to south-east China and Viet Nam (<em>moupinensis</em>); and <br/><br/>4.  'Indonesian race' (or banded pig) from the Malay Peninsular, Sumatra, Java, Bali and certain offshore islands (<em>vittatus</em>).<br/><br/>In Europe, it is widespread in most continental areas, with the exception of northern Fennoscandia and European Russia. As mentioined above, it disappeared from the British Isles and Scandinavia in the 17th century, although it has now been reintroduced to Sweden and escaped animals have established themselves in the wild in Britain (Spitz 1999). Animals have escaped from captivity in the UK and have established themselves in the wild. There are at least three small wild populations in England, on the Kent/East Sussex border, in Dorset, and in Hereford (Battersby 2005). It is native to Corsica and Sardinia, but the population in Sicily was introduced (Spitz 1999).<br/><br/>Introduced populations are not included in the distribution map.",,Terrestrial,"Generally, few, if any, practical measures have been taken in any country for the specific purpose of conserving wild populations of any subspecies of <em>S. scrofa</em>, except in the sense of maintaining stock levels for hunting, particularly for sport hunting. Thus Genov <em>et al</em>. (1991) reported a gradual increase of the wild boar population in Bulgaria in the late 1950s following legal measures to regulate hunting, and because of the reintroduction of animals from breeding farms in the north-east of the country, in the Balkan Range and Sredna Gora. Even in this instance, however, other factors may also be operating, since similar increases in the local wild pig populations in Spain, France, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and eastern Russia have been described by Sáez-Royuela and Tellería (1986), who simply attributed this trend to a progression to a more temperate climate and, hence, progressively milder winters of benefit to these animals. <br/><br/>Local wild pig populations are also reported to be increasing in numbers in several countries as a consequence of the spread of Islam. For example, the north-west African race, <em>S. s. algira</em>, although extinct in Libya, is thought to be expanding in neighboring Algeria where it is designated a game animal but, as the meat is now seldom eaten in this country, hunting pressure has been greatly reduced since colonial times (Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalski, 1991). These authors also cite earlier reports of wild boars hybridizing with domestic pigs, but the latter are no longer kept in Algeria.<br/><br/><em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> has been included in the IUCN Red List since 1982, where its 'Vulnerable' status reflected a widespread concern about the environmentally destructive development of the Ryukyu Islands and the growing number of threats to the ecosystems and endemic species of Iriomote and other islands in this region. In 1978, these concerns led to the passing of a resolution at the 14th IUCN General Assembly in Ashkhabad, which called upon the Government of Japan to take immediate steps to ensure the conservation of Iriomote Island and its endemic taxa, and for the subsequent designation of the whole of the Nansei Shoto Region (often referred to as the 'Galápagos of the East' on account of the high percent endemicity of its fauna and flora) as a bio-geographical priority region in the World Conservation Strategy. In 1982, the 'Nansei Shoto Conservation Project' was launched by WWF-Japan, with initial emphasis being placed on the conduct of wildlife and socio-economic surveys on Iriomote and Amami Oshima (Obara, 1984a,b). In the interim, however, the desired increased protection of the Nansei Shoto Region was clearly at odds with the Japanese Government's regional policies, and the development of the islands continued - a circumstance which led to the passage of a another resolution, highlighting Japan's treatment of the region, at the 16th General Assembly of IUCN in Costa Rica in 1986. This also appears to have had little affect, as evinced by further major development plans, including the controversial Ishigaki Airport extension, and recent plans to construct a new dam and road on Iriomote Island. Although one third of Iriomote has been designated as a national park, the proposed road will cut through the park and will also increase access by poachers who have already reduced the wild pig to less than half of its numbers before the park was created (Brazil, 1988). <br/><br/>Of all wild pigs species, <em>S. scrofa</em> is by far the most widely maintained and bred in captivity, though general perceptions about the relative abundance of this species has resulted in diminished interest in its propagation. Many zoos, particularly in western Europe, have therefore disposed of their stocks of these animals, mostly to 'wild boar breeding farms', which have escalated in number to meet growing demands in the gourmet meat markets and for commercial diversification. In addition, increasingly restrictive quarantine and other veterinary regulations appertaining to the international movements of all live suids, has made it extremely difficult to establish new breeding programs.<br/><br/>Contrarily, since these animals are most easily acquired in their countries of origin, local stocks are most likely to be pure-bred and, hence, most valuable for research and conservation purposes. In this situation, priority should be given to the establishment of national or regional breeding programmes for each of the rarest subspecies, especially <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em>.<br/><br/>As a general rule, <em>S. scrofa</em> is both highly adaptable and highly resistant to a variety of degradative processes, and may thrive under conditions of habitat modification and hunting pressure which have devastated other forms of wildlife. In addition, most subspecies are well represented in protected areas in their relatively extensive ranges. Nonetheless, there are reasons for concern about a number of distinct populations of <em>S. scrofa</em>, of which the Ryukyu pigs are undoubtedly the most seriously threatened. Indeed, <em>riukiuanus</em> is the only subspecies of <em>S. scrofa</em> to be included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals (IUCN, 1990), where it has been accorded the status of 'Vulnerable' since 1982, but is already thought to be 'Endangered' on at least four of the six islands in the Ryukyu Chain which constitute its entire, and therefore extremely restricted, range. This particular form is also the most distinct, and (with an average adult male body weight of only about 45 kg; Barber <em>et al</em>., 1984) by far the smallest, subspecies. It is therefore of some interest as a potential genetic resource, as well as being one of the principal 'flagship' animals for increased conservation activity in the crucially important Nansei Shoto Region. For all of these reasons, the following recommendations (taken from Oliver <em>et al</em> 1993) are mostly confined to the immediate and longer-term management requirements of this taxon.<br/><br/><strong>Objectives<br/>1. To promote local interest in, and the enhanced future protection and management of, the Ryukyu Islands' dwarf wild pig, <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em>, and any other threatened native subspecies may be identified in the future;<br/><br/>2. To promote further applied research on the taxonomy, distribution, conservation status and biology of the species, particularly the least known forms; <br/><br/>3. To discourage any future releases of any specimens of any subspecies of this species, or its domestic and feral derivatives, outside their known former ranges, and encourage the eradication or control of such introduced populations as may exist at present; and<br/><br/>4. To investigate the cultural and economic significance of these animals to local people, particularly in Southeast Asia, and their potential genetic importance in terms of: a) possibilities for their further domestication and/or b) an enhanced understanding of the origins and relationships of present day domestic and wild populations.<br/><br/><strong>Priority Projects:</strong><br/>1. Provide all appropriate support to any existing or proposed future conservation initiatives in the Nansei Shoto Region, relevant to the enhanced future management and protection of the Ryukyu Island's dwarf wild pig, <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em>. <br/><br/>2. Conduct (preliminary or repeat) status surveys on all (six) islands in the Ryukyu Group known to support remnant populations of <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> (i.e. Iriomote, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Tokunoshima, Amamioshima and Kakerome), and implement emergent recommendations. <br/><br/>3. Promote development of a coordinated breeding programmed for <em>S. s. riukiuanus,/i&gt;, both nationally and internationally.<br/><br/>4. Collect, evaluate and disseminate data on the taxonomic relationships, distribution and conservation status of other, less-known forms, with a view to the resolution of certain outstanding taxonomic problems and the development of recommendations for their enhanced future protection, if so required. Additional data is needed on the distribution and status of some, poorly-known subspecies and populations, including a tentatively assigned form (subsp. nov.) from the central highlands of Sri Lanka and the insular <em>taivanus</em> (Taiwan). Efforts should also be made to resolve outstanding questions relating to the genetic distinctness and range limitations of many of the continental races, which are poorly understood at present.<br/><br/>5. Promote further research on the biology and ecology of all less-studied populations, particularly those in extreme habitats, or in areas of sympatry with other species of <em>Sus,/i&gt;. Most of the information on this species has originated from studies conducted in Europe or on the feral populations in the U.S.A., Australia and New Zealand. Priority should therefore be given to studies of other populations elsewhere, particularly those in semi-desert regions or other extreme habitats, and/or studies focused on the ecological and genetic relationships between this and other species of Sus in those areas where sympatry occurs (e.g. with <em>S. barbatus</em> in the Malaysian Peninsular and Sumatra, and with <em>S. verrucosus</em> on Java).</em></em></strong>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

However, in its native range in Turkey, this species has suffered severe declines and has disappeared most of its former distribution (M. Masseti pers. comm.). There is only one surviving population of <em>D. dama</em> that is considered to be an original native population. This population is restricted to Telmessos National Park in Turkey and numbers fewer than 30 individuals (Masseti 2007), with apparently fewer than ten animals remaining outside the fended area. It has declined by over 50% in the last ten years and is genetically distinct from <em>D. dama</em> occurring elsewhere (Masseti 2002, 2007). The population of <em>D. dama</em> on Rhodes has not been subject to any systematic research on population size (D. Mertzanidou pers. comm.). The distribution range of fallow deer on Rhodes is about 550 km², and a subjective estimate of the population size ranges between 400 – 800 individuals (D. Mertzanidou pers. comm.). Masseti (2002, 2007) estimated that there were 400-500 animals on Rhodes. There are recent signs of population recovery on Rhodes (D. Mertzanidou pers. comm.).",Unknown,"This is a western Palaearctic species. Its original range is unclear, but current knowledge suggests that Turkey and southern Europe (southern Italy, Sicily and the southern Balkan peninsula) were the post-glacial refuges of the species (Heidemann, 1976 and 1986; Chapman and Chapman, 1980; Bökönyi, 1986; Masseti and Rustioni, 1988; Masseti, 1996, 1999 and 2002; Burgio <em>et al</em>., 1998), though the palaeontological and archaeozoological evidence of the species’ diffusion in all these areas is very fragmentary. Records from Iran and the Middle East refer to <em>Dama mesopotamica</em>. Only one undoubtedly natural wild population survives, in the Düzlerçami Game Reserve in the Termessos National Park in southern Turkey, though this is now largely fenced. Other populations in Turkey, at Ayvalik Adalar, Gokova, Adakoy and Stavros-tis-Psokas appear to have died out in recent years (M. Masseti pers. comm.). The population on the island of Rhodes (Greece) is said to have been introduced in Neolithic times (Masseti 2007; Masseti <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2008). Certainly, fossils of fallow deer on Rhodes go back to Neolithic times, and there are no signs of prolonged periods of domestication, and so it could be considered a native population (D. Mertzanidou pers. comm.). The population on Cyprus was introduced in the 20th century (Masseti 1999). The animals on Rhodes are genetically very distinct from all others, as are those in Termessos National Park (Masseti 2007; Masseti <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2008).<br/><br/>The species was introduced to the western Mediterranean by the Phoenicians, and to central and northern Europe by the Romans and Normans. However, most of the currently existing populations in Europe result from much more recent introductions (with the exception of some older ones in, for example, the United Kingdom, and at Castel Porziano in Italy). The distribution in Europe is much more scattered and patchy than indicated on the map (which shows its general extent of occurrence). Furthermore, most European populations are fenced and closely managed, and there are rather few truly free-ranging populations (though some are in the United Kingdom). The population on Rhodes is, however, free-ranging. In most places the fallow deer is managed as a park animal, as almost the whole of its present geographic range is attributable to humans. In Portugal, for example, most of the specimens occur within confined areas, such as parks and private hunting areas, and apart from a few scattered individuals there is no wild population (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). Also in other areas such as Sicily and Calabria (Italy) there are only fenced and managed populations (M. Masseti pers. comm.). Most European animals (with the excepton those in Termessos National Park and on Rhodes) are essentially descended from domestic stock, and there are colour varieties that are considered to be a result of domestication.  <br/><br/>More recently, the species has been introduced to many countries worldwide (not included in the distribution map), including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand (considered a pest there), the United States, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as islands in Fijian group, the Lesser Antilles, and off the Pacific coast of Canada (Apollonio 1999). (Apollonio 1999).","Most hunting for the species is sustainable, but poaching of the tiny remaining native population in southern Turkey is a major problem.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention. It occurs in a large number of protected areas. The main conservation priority for this species is to protect the surviving native population in the Düzlerçami Game Reserve in the Termessos National Park in southern Turkey. This will require strong anti-poaching measures, recovery management, captive breeding and re-introductions. <br/><br/>The population on Rhodes is also very important genetically and should also be the focus of conservation programmes. The free-ranging animals on Rhodes are protected by Greek law. Although poaching is still taking place, this is to a much lesser extent than was the case in the past. Thanks to more effective control of poaching, as well as the reduced number of large fires on the island, the fallow deer population seems to have recovered and regained much of its former range (up until 1960 it occurred in almost all of the rural and natural areas on the island). A fallow deer conservation plan for Greece is now needed, which should include: a) the establishment of a population and habitat monitoring program; b) the creation of a compensation system as well as a monitoring programme for agricultural damage caused by deer; c) the introduction of fallow deer of Rhodian origin to other places in Greece; and d) the implementation of public awareness and participatory programmes for the conservation of the species (D.

10695218,42397,Capra ibex,Least Concern,,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is not declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. The species needs conservation action to prevent future decline.","Alpine ibex typically inhabit open, rocky habitats at high altitude, above the tree line. Steep, south-facing slops with rugged topography and grassy vegetation are preferred. Below the tree line, at subalpine levels, ibex are only found in open, sunny woodland interspersed with rocky outcrops (Nievergelt and Zingg 1986, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). Ibex feed on alpine grasses, herbaceous plants and shrubs (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). This species is diurnal, but most active during the early morning and late afternoon. Living in montane pastures, they eat grasses and some woody plants.  They migrate seasonally to different altitudes, spending the harsher winter months at medium elevations. The animals occur in maternal herds of 10-20 members, while males roam solitarily or in bachelor groups.  Females gestate for about 170 days, and usually carry one kid per pregnancy.  Females are sexually mature by 18 months, and males are mature at 2 years. The species lifespan is typically 10-14 years.","Although the species is not considered threatened at present, there is concern regarding genetic diversity, the founder effect and minimum viable populations (Shackleton 1997, Maudet <em>et al.</em> 2002). Genetic variability in ibex populations is among the lowest reported from microsatellites in mammal species, and the Alpi Marittime-Mercantour population in particular has suffered from a severe genetic bottleneck associated with its reintroduction (Maudet <em>et al.</em> 2002). The ibex's distribution remains fragmented and many colonies are small and thus vulnerable to epizootics and stochastic events as well as inbreeding depression. Colonies with &gt;60 individuals are believed to be viable as long as diseases (most importantly mange) do not affect them (Shackleton 1997, EMA Workshop 2006). Hybridization can be a threat where populations are small and sympatric with high densities of domestic goats, as is the case in Italy (Randi <em>et al.</em> 1990, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). High densities of domestic goats and sheep may also have a negative impact on the ibex through parasite and disease transmission and resource competition (Shackleton 1997, J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Appropriate habitat for the species may be decreasing, as the abandonment of traditional agriculture means that high-altitude alpine meadows are reverting to forest through natural succession (EMA Workshop 2006). Human disturbance as a result of increased tourism and recreation is suspected to be a general threat to mountain ungulates (Shackleton 1997). Alpine ibex are legally hunted in some areas (e.g. Bulgaria, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia), although hunting is completely prohibited in several range states (Shackleton 1997). Legal hunting is not considered a threat if it is properly planned and regulated, but poaching is a potential threat (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001).","After centuries of decline caused primarily by intensive hunting, at the beginning of the 19th century at most a few hundred Alpine ibex survived in the Gran Paradiso massif (Valle d'Aosta region, Italy). Current ibex populations in the Alps are generally restricted to mountain areas above the tree line and are the result of both translocations from the original core of c.100 individuals and natural colonisation (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001). These efforts, together with spontaneous migration from adjoining countries, have increased the population and the number of areas inhabited by ibex, although the distribution is still discontinuous (Stüwe and Nievergelt 1991, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006). In the 1990s it was estimated that c.30,000 ibex lived in the Alps (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). Populations grew steadily from the 1960s to the 1990s, showing a mean annual growth rate between 3% and 6% (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001). About 15,000 ibex were estimated in Switzerland, 9,700 in Italy, 3,200 in Austria, 3,300 in France, 250 in Slovenia and, and 220 in Germany (Shackleton 1997).",Increasing,"The Alpine ibex is endemic to Europe, where its native range is the Alps of France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and northern Italy (Shackleton 1997; Grubb, 2005). It has been introduced to Slovenia and Bulgaria (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). The ibex was driven very close to extinction in the early 19th century, and with the exception of the population in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), all current populations originate from re-introductions or introductions. Although the range of the ibex has increased over the last century as a result of translocations and natural colonisation, its distribution is still rather patchy in the Alps. It occurs from 500 to 3,000 m (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999).<br/><br/>In Austria, all current populations originate from re-introductions, although not always into former or even suitable habitat. The first colony was re-established in 1924 in the Bluhnbach valley (Hagen mountains), and the second in 1936, farther east in Wildalpen, so that by 1988, <em>ca</em>. 740 ibex had been released (Bauer, 1991). By the 1990s, the species is now found in the Bhihnbach valley (Hagen mountains), in the Northern Limestone alps in Wildalpen, and in the Pitz and Kauner valleys of Tyrol, and in the Styria (Hochlantsch massif). In France, it is found mainly in the eastern part of the Alps. Four ibex populations had been re-established in Germany by the 1990s. The first introduction was made at Koenigsee (Berchtesgaden) in 1936 with 24 animals. The founding animals came from the Aosta valley (Italy), from Peter and Paul, and from the Berlin and Munich Zoological Gardens. The animals dispersed after a few years to the Austrian Bluebachtal. In 1951, the population was reduced considerably after an outbreak of sarcoptic mange, but since then numbers have increased slowly. The population straddles the German-Austrian border, wintering in Austria and summering in the Bavarian Alps in Germany. A second population was established at Jachenau, partly the result of immigration of one male from the Austrian colony at Baechental, supplemented by four animals from Swiss founder populations in 1967. After the addition of several more ibex, this population increased to about 100 animals by the 1990s; however, its range is very restricted and there is little potential for expansion. A small colony in Oberaudorf was the result of a re-introduction in 1963 which failed to disperse. It is now restricted to an area of about 100 ha, and foresters consider it a problem because of range over-use. Another small, restricted population became established through natural dispersal from Austria, but its size is unknown. Ibex were introduced into the Rila mountains of Bulgaria (Atlas of the Mammals of Bulgaria) in the mid-1980s. In Italy, re-introductions, combined with some spontaneous migration from adjoining countries (Peracino and Bassano, 1986; Tosi <em>et al.</em>, 1986a), have increased areas with ibex, but its distribution is still rather discontinuous in the Alps.",This species is hunted for sport and food. Legal hunting is well-managed and is not considered to be a threat to the species.,Terrestrial,"The Alpine ibex is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and Annex V of the EU Habitats and Species Directive, and is protected under national legislation in most range states. It occurs in a number of protected areas (e.g. Hohe Tauern and Kalkhochalpen National Parks, Austria; Vanoise, Ecrins, and Mercantour National Parks, France; Gran Paradiso and Stelvio National Parks and Maritime Alps Natural Park, Italy), and it has been the subject of intensive conservation management in the form of reintroductions and introductions (Shackleton 1997). Reintroductions began at the end of the 19th century in the Swiss Alps, while in Italy they have been significant only since the 1970s (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>According to Shackleton (1997) and Dupré <em>et al.</em> (2001), the main proposal for ibex conservation is to continue restocking populations in appropriate habitats. Reintroductions should also be carefully planned, e.g. by  (1) Using environmental evaluation models for selecting areas for reintroducing ibex, in conjunction with (2) a conservation strategy that aims to make the separate colonies part of a single metapopulation; (3) Giving priority to protected areas, or to other areas capable of guaranteeing efficient surveillance against poaching and disturbance (although this does not mean that controlled hunting areas should be <em>a priori</em> excluded); (4) Selecting founder individuals for new colonies according to specific criteria; (5) Limiting domestic sheep and goat grazing in reintroduction areas to decrease the possibility of parasite and disease transmission, resource competition, and hybridization; and (6) Screeing reintroduction sites for suitability in relation to health and disease transmission.<br/><br/>Other conservation recommendations include ensuring that any harvest is sustainable (through research, legislation, and international cooperation), reducing poaching (through legislation, enforcement, education and communication), reducing the impacts of human disturbance (e.g. by providing refugia in areas with intense tourism), and monitoring all populations.",Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean
12689285,63543,Camelus ferus,Critically Endangered,A3de+4ade,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is assessed as Critically Endangered. The Wild Bactrian Camel is facing a population size reduction of at least 80% within the next three generations (estimated at 45 to 50 years). This projection is based on observations made during five expeditions (1993 - Mongolian Gobi and 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 - Chinese Gobi). The population is the target of continued hunting (mainly persecution because the camels compete with domestic camels and livestock for water and grazing, but also sport hunting). Mining, both legal and illegal, and the proposed construction of a gas pipeline and the associated industrial development, as well as a proposed kaolin mine, would also have an impact on the main Chinese subpopulation of Wild Bactrian Camel. The effects of hybridization with domestic camels both in Mongolia and China and increased human competition and economic pressures within the designated habitat of the wild Bactrian camel, have also prompted this listing. The Mongolian subpopulation is known to have declined by 46% since 1985. However, due to increased hunting and wolf predation it is now expected that 25-30 animals will be lost annually from this subpopulation (a substantial increase in the mortality rate). Based on these observations and assuming that the trends will continue into the future, it is estimated that there will be at least an 84% reduction in the population size by the year 2033 (approximately three generations from 1985). Given the increasing threats to the Chinese subpopulations (where at least 20 animals are killed annually) there is no reason to expect the situation for these subpopulations to be any different.","This species is found in the Gobi and Gashun Gobi deserts of northwest China and Mongolia. While vegetation is sparse, the desert itself varies from rocky mountain massifs, to the flat pavement-like areas of the extremely arid desert; stony ""gobi"" desert plains; poplar fringed oases; vast washed-out plains and high sand dunes. In some areas, in the absence of fresh water, it has adapted to drinking salt water slush which the domestic camel will not touch.","It is estimated from information received from the Protected Area staff and Mongolian scientists working in the 'Great Gobi Reserve A' that in Mongolia, 25 to 30 Wild Bactrian Camels are being killed annually when they migrate across the international border into China on the southernmost boundary of the protected area 'Great Gobi Reserve A'. The hunting is mainly for local subsistence use.<br/><br/>Due to the reduction in water points (oases) because of drought, wolves have increased their predation of Wild Bactrian Camels. This activity is concentrated at the remaining water points in the area. The remaining habitat in Mongolia is also being degraded by domestic livestock.<br/><br/>In China in the new Arjin Shan Lop Nur Nature Sanctuary, up to 20 Wild Bactrian Camels are killed annually by miners and hunters for subsistence use. Economic pressure to use the areas adjoining the Nature Reserve as grazing for domestic Bactrian camels has increased  hybridisation on the southern border and this poses a significant threat to the unique genetic strain of the Wild Bactrian Camel which current scientific DNA research suggests is a separate species.<br/><br/>For 45 years, this area of the Gashun Gobi was the nuclear test site area of China. In spite of this, the Wild Bactrian Camel survived and is apparently breeding naturally. Since the cessation of nuclear tests in China, the Wild Bactrian Camel now faces new threats including highly toxic illegal mining and hunting for food and sport. Parts of the Wild Bactrian Camel's designated habitat are likely to be designated for industrial use (gas pipe line laying, exploitation of minerals).  Domestic Bactrian camels and goats have also been introduced to the designated areas and hence compete for grazing and water.","In the year 2004, there were approximately 600 individuals surviving in China and 350 in Mongolia, with numbers continuing to decrease (J. Hare pers. comm.). In 1985 the Mongolian subpopulation numbered 650 animals.",Decreasing,"The Bactrian Camel is restricted to four subpopulations in China and Mongolia: Gashun Gobi, Gansu, China; Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang, China (this population has declined and may now be extinct); the northern slopes of Arjin Shan mountains and adjacent areas in Lop Nur Wild Camel National Reserve, China; and the Great Gobi Section A Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia, and adjacent areas in China (Reading <em>et al</em>. 1999, Mix <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Mongolia, the species is found in the Trans Altai Govi Desert (Mix <em>et al</em>. 2002), including the foothills of the Edren Range to Shiveet Ulaan, and the Hükh Tömörtei Range to the state border (Mix <em>et al</em>. 2002, Adiya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Adiya and Dovchindorj 2005).<br/><br/>A domestic form, considered under a separate species name (<em>Camelus bactrianus</em>), exists in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China (Grubb 2005).<br/><br/>The range of the wild Bactrian camel in historic times extended from about the great bend of the Yellow River, across the deserts of southern Mongolia and northwestern China to central Kazakhstan. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the species had been extirpated from the western part of its range, and persisted only in remote areas of the Gobi and Taklimakan Deserts. These populations have become increasingly fragmented over the past 150 years (Schaller 1998).",This species is still hunted for food and sport.,Terrestrial,"The 'Great Gobi Reserve A' was established in Mongolia in 1982 and in 2000, the 'Arjin Shan Lop Nur Nature Reserve'  was established in China.

This is an urgent conservation priority. Only fifteen wild Bactrian camels are currently in captivity in China and Mongolia. With so few captive animals, the whole species could be wiped out if their natural habitats in China and Mongolia are destroyed.

It is assessed as Data Deficient.,"The jungle cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with the classic rainforest ""jungle"" habitat, but rather with wetlands - habitats with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments.  Hence its other common and more applicable name, the swamp cat. Water and dense ground cover can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert (where it is found near oases or along riverbeds) to grassland, shrubby woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br><br>Areas with extensive deciduous dipterocarp forest and at least scattered surface water are the species predominant known habitat in Indochina. However, areas such as the Nakai Plateau which support other forms of savanna-like vegetation may support the species. It is probably absent from all closed canopy forests, including rainforest. The species may make use of agricultural areas with a low intensity of human use and which retain patches of scrub (Duckworth <i>et al.</i>, 2005).<br><br>Jungle cats have adapted well to irrigated cultivation, having been observed in many different types of agricultural and forest plantations throughout their range, such as sugar cane plantations in India.  In Israel they can be found around pisciculture ponds and irrigation ditches.  Vereschagin (1959) noted that the jungle cat's use of the semi-arid plains of Azerbaijan increased with the development of a local irrigation system and decreased with its abandonment.  However, mowing the seasonally flooded riverine tugai vegetation (trees and shrubs with dense stands of tall reeds and grasses) of this region for livestock fodder, as well as plowing it under for agriculture, is known to be associated with the decline of jungle cat populations in the European-central Asian parts of its range (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).  <br><br>Jungle cats feed mainly on prey that weighs less than one kilogram.  Small mammals, principally rodents,  are the prey most frequently found in feces and stomach contents.  A study in India's Sariska reserve estimated that jungle cats catch and eat three to five rodent per day (Mukherjee <i>et al.</i> 2004).  Birds rank second in importance, but in southern Russia waterfowl are the mainstay of jungle cat diet in the winter.  With overwintering populations of waterfowl congretating in large numbers on unfrozen rivers and marshes, the jungle cat hunts among reeed beds and along edges of wetlands, searching for injured or weakened birds.  Other prey species are taken more opportunistically, including hares, nutria, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and fish.  In India, they have been seen to scavenge kills of large predators such as the Asiatic lion.  In a study in southern Uzbekistan, the fruits of the Russian olive made up 17% of their diet in winter.  While jungle cats specialize on small prey, they are large and powerful enough to kill young swine, subadult gazelles, and chital fawns (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).<br><br>Density estimates from natural tugai habitat in central Asia range from 4-15 individuals per 10 km², but where this vegetation type has declined due to development density does not exceed two cats per 10 km² (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).","Jungle cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker <em>et al.</em> 2003, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2005).  India formerly exported large numbers of jungle cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979), and some illegal trade continues there (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), as well as in Egypt (Glas in press) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004).","The jungle cat is considered common in some parts of its range, primarily in India (Mukherjee 1988), but also Pakistan and Bangladesh (Duckworth <i>et al.</i>, 2005).  <br><br>In southern China and southeast Asia (with the exception of northeastern Cambodia),  however, it appears quite rare in comparison to sympatric small cats (Duckworth <i>et al</i>. 2005).  This rarity appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon associated with unselective trapping and snaring, especially in Lao PDR and Thailand as well, where it was described as common by Lekagul and McNeely (1977) but has since suffered drastic declines and is rarely encountered (Duckworth <i>et al</i>. 2005; Lynam <i>et al.</i> 2006, W. Duckworth and R. Steinmetz, Southeast Asia mammal assessment 2003).<br><br>In Europe, it is of marginal occurrence, with small populations in Cis-Caspian region and the Caucasus along the Caspian Sea. The European population has been rapidly declining since the 1960s. There was no records of this species in Astrakhan State Reserve (Russian Federation) since the 1980s. In Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation) only about 150 animals were recorded (Kuryatnikov and Varziev 1983). Marked population fluctuations are characteristic of this species in this region, probably because of absence of adaptations to cold winters. Despite these fluctuations the long-term trend in Europe is of decline in both population and area of occupancy. Data from Russia suggest that there are about 500 animals left in the wild (Prisazhnyuk and Belousova 2007). A very small population persists in Georgia (I. Macharashvili pers. comm. to K. Tsysulina 2007).  This species is considered threatened in a number of range states in Europe and the Caucasus, and is included in the Red Books of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (IUCN 2007).<br><br>In southwest Asia the species is also considered rare and threatened (Abu-Baker <i>et al</i>. 2003, Habibi 2004).",Decreasing,"The jungle cat has a broad but patchy distribution.  In Africa, it is found only in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley south to Aswan, and in El Faiyum, Farafara, Dakhla and Kharga oases (Glas in press).  Into southwest Asia, it occurs through Israel, southern Lebanon, northwestern Jordan, western Syria, and into Turkey and western Iraq (Abu-Baker <em>et al.</em>, 2003).  In this region its occurrence is highly localized around riparian vegetation and permanent water sources.  In central Asia, it is found in the Caucasus mountains (up to 1,000 m), around the Caspian and Aral Seas and associated river valleys, and through Iran west to Pakistan.  It occurs widely in tropical and sub-tropical Asia, including almost all of India as well as Sri Lanka, ranging up to 2,400 m in the Himalayan foothills, and through Southeast Asia to southern China, but absent from Malayan peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).

Some farmers consider the jungle cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker <i>et al.</i> 2003), and conservation measures should include better protection for domestic fowl and halting of indiscriminate poisoning and trapping.

Newby, in Scholte in press). Known remnant populations are all very small and extremely fragmented; the only known populations of any size are in Manga (Chad), eastern Air (Niger), and the Mali/Niger border area. In all areas surveyed, numbers have been very low and the size of observed gazelle groups very small (range=1-5 individuals) (Lamarque <em>et al.</em> 2007).

In North Africa, Dama Gazelle are now probably extinct, although they may survive in the Drâa (where observations were made by nomads in 1993) (Cuzin 1996; Aulagnier <em>et al.</em> 2001). It is also possible, though increasingly unlikely, that they may survive in very small numbers along the border between southern Morocco and Mauritania (Cuzin <em>et al</em>. in press).

Other prey include ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares.  Cheetahs, unlike other African predators, rarely scavenge and do not remain long with their kills, many of which are stolen by other carnivores.  Cheetahs are primarily active during the day, unlike other predators, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are primarily found in open grassy habitats, but also make use of dry forest, savanna woodland, semi-desert and scrub, being absent from tropical rainforest.  There are reports of cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In the central Sahara, cheetahs occur in high mountain habitat - the Saharan mountains are hyper-arid, but still receive slightly higher rainfall than the surrounding desert.  They are thus better vegetated and support small permanent waterholes and antelope populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Cheetah habitat in Iran consists of desert, much of it with precipitation of fewer than 100 mm per year. The terrain ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m. The vegetation, if any, consists of a sparse cover of shrubs, most less than one meter tall, of the genera <em>Salsola</em>, <em>Artemisia</em>, <em>Zygophyllum</em>, <em>Astragulus</em>, <em>Aphaxis</em>, and others. Gazelles <em>Gazella subgutturosa</em> and <em>G. bennetti</em> were preferred prey, but they have now become scarce through over-hunting and replacement by livestock (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Opportunistic recovery of cheetah kills suggests that wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian ibex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are the key prey species today though none are considered optimal for cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among the felids.  Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three.  Some coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group.  Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, which remain attached to and mate with the females in a single pride, cheetah male coalitions mate with as many females as possible (Caro 1994), and females show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Female cheetahs in areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains) follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km²) and attempt to mate with females passing through (Durant <em>et al</em>. 1988; Caro 1994).  However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females have smaller, overlapping ranges that are similar in size (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  On Namibian farmlands, where prey is non-migratory, both cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km²); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range.  The reasons for such large home ranges were unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002).   <br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for lions, leopards, tigers and jaguars in prime habitat: Durant, 2007).  On the Serengeti plains, cheetah densities range from 0.8-1.0 per 100 km², but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km² (Caro 1994).  Caro (1994) attributes lower cheetah densities to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as lions and hyenas that can kill cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands, where lions and hyenas have been eradicated, cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km²) (Marker 2002).","In Eastern Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation was identified as the primary threat during a conservation strategy workshop (Anon. 2007).   Because cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of cheetahs (Durant 2007).<br/><br/>A depleted wild ungulate prey base is of serious concern in northern Africa (Berzins and Belbachir 2006).  Cheetahs which turn to livestock are killed as pests (Claro 2003; Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 2003; Wacher <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Conflict with farmers and depletion of the wild prey base are also considered significant threats in parts of Eastern Africa (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah <em>A. j. venaticus</em> is threatened indirectly by loss of prey base through human hunting activities. In addition, most protected areas are open to seasonal livestock grazing, which potentially places huge pressure on the resident ungulate populations through disturbance and potential competition (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, domestic dogs accompanying the herds present a likely threat to both cheetahs and their prey (H. Ziaie pers. comm. 2008)  An emerging threat is the possibility of fragmentation into discontinuous subpopulations as a result of increasing developmental pressures (mining, oil, roads, railways); this is particularly the case in Kavir N.P., currently the north-western limit of the Asiatic Cheetah's range (L. Hunter and L. Marker pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Conflict with farmers and ranchers is the major threat to cheetahs in southern Africa (Purchase <em>et al</em>. 2007).  Cheetah are often killed or persecuted because they are a perceived threat to livestock, despite the fact that they cause relatively little damage. In Namibia, very large numbers of cheetahs have been live-trapped and removed by ranchers seeking to protect their livestock (from government permit records, Nowell [1996] calculated that over 9,500 cheetahs were removed from 1978-1995).  While removal rates have fallen, in part due to intensified conservation and education efforts, many ranchers still view cheetahs as a problem animal, despite research showing that cheetahs were only responsible for 3% of livestock losses to predators (Marke, 2002). Although cheetah in Iran have been killed because of predation on livestock, since 2003, there has been no direct evidence of killing cheetahs (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007), though it is likely most incidents go unreported. <br/><br/>Cheetahs are also vulnerable to being caught in snares set for other species (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>Another threat to the cheetah is interspecific competition with other large predators, especially lions. On the open, short-grass plains of the Serengeti, juvenile mortality can be as high as 95%, largely due to predation by lions (Laurenson 1994). However, mortality rates are lower in more closed habitats (Caro in press). <br/><br/>CITES allows legal trade in live animals and hunting trophies under an Appendix I quota system (annual quotas: Namibia - 150; Zimbabwe - 50; Botswana - 5).  This was accepted by CITES as a way to enhance the economic value of cheetahs on private lands and provide an economic incentive for their conservation (Nowell 1996).  The global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining; cheetahs breed poorly in captivity and in 2001 30% of the captive population was wild-caught (Marker 2002).  While analysis of trade records in the CITES database shows that these countries have reported almost no live exports since the late 1990s, Purchase <em>et al.</em> (2007) are concerned that there is a substantial illegal cross-border trade in live animals.  There is also concern about illegal trade in skins, as well as capture of live cubs for trade to the Middle East (Anon. 2007).  There is an increasing trade in cubs from north-east Africa into the Middle East (Amir 2005),  but there is currently little trade in cubs from the Sahel region, where it was previously considered a major problem (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are active during the daytime and there is concern that they can be driven off their kills by tourist cars crowding around, or mothers separated from their cubs.  Burney (1980) conducted a study and concluded that tourist cars did not seem to harm cheetahs, and in fact sometimes helped, as cheetah chases more often ended in a kill when there were cars around, distracting prey, providing cover from which to stalk, or otherwise waking cheetahs up to notice prey in the area.  However, tourist numbers have risen sharply by then, and its potential impact on cheetahs remains a concern (Caro 1994; Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>The Eastern African cheetah conservation strategy (Anon. 2007) identified four sets of constraints to mitigating these threats across a large spatial scale.  Political constraints include lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability in some ecologically important areas, and lack of political will to foster cheetah conservation.  Economic constraints include lack of financial resources to support conservation, and lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife.  Social constraints include negative conceptions of cheetahs, lack of capacity to achieve  conservation, lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes leading to subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation.  These potentially mutable human constraints contrast with several biological constraints which are characteristic of cheetahs and cannot be changed, including wide-ranging behaviour, negative interactions with other large carnivores, and potential susceptibility to disease.<br/><br/>Disease is a potential threat to the cheetah (Anon. 2007), as its reduced genetic diversity can increase a population's susceptibility  (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1983).  However, the most serious disease mortality thus far documented in wild cheetahs was from naturally occurring anthrax in Namibia's Etosha National Park; cheetahs, unlike other predators, do not scavenge carcasses of ungulates killed by anthrax, and thus had no built-up immunity when they preyed upon springbok sick with the disease (Lindeque <em>et al</em>. 1998).  The cheetah's low density may offer some measure of protection against infectious disease; for example, cheetahs were not affected by an outbreak of Canine Distemper Virus in the Serengeti National Park which killed over 1/3 of the lion population.  Serological surveys of cheetahs on Namibian farmland indicate some exposure and survival of the disease (Marker 2002).","Southern Africa is the cheetah's regional stronghold, with a ""roughly"" estimated population of at least 4,500 adults (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).  This regional estimate breaks down as follows:  Angola - present but unknown; Botswana - 1,800; Malawi - &lt;25 (and probably extirpated: Purchase and Purchase 2007); Mozambique: &lt;50; Namibia - 2,000; South Africa - 550; Zambia - 100; Zimbabwe - 400.  A large proportion of the estimated population lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game, and where lions and hyenas have been extirpated.<br/><br/>The number of known resident cheetahs in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents.  Most population estimates were derived from applying a density estimate of one adult per 100 km² to mapped resident range areas during a conservation strategy workshop, although a few are based on research.  Only four of the 15 known populations were estimated to number &gt;200 animals; the largest population (Serengeti/Maro/Tsavo in Kenya and Tanzania) is estimated at 710.  It would be much smaller if unprotected lands were included.  Overall, less than half of the estimated cheetah population inhabits protected areas.  In addition, approximately half lives in habitat blocks which are trans-boundary, requiring international cooperation for conservation of the population.  Cheetahs possibly occur over an area which is several times as large as the range of the known population (Anon. 2007).  <br/><br/>These estimates can be compared with previous population estimates based on extensive field interviews and application of density estimates.  There is rough accord for Kenya at 793 (Gros 1998) and Tanzania at 569-1,007 (Gros 2002).  However, in Uganda, Gros and Rejmanek (1999) estimated 40-295 with a wider range in the Karamoja region, whereas now cheetahs have been extirpated and just 12 are estimated to persist in Kidepo National Park and surroundings (Anon. 2007).<br/><br/>In the remainder of Africa, there are few reliable population estimates.  Cheetahs are considered extinct or possibly extinct in many countries (Marker 2002).  In northwest Africa the population is probably fewer than 250 mature individuals and the subspecies A. j. heckii is listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>In Asia cheetahs are now known to exist only in Iran, where the subspecies A. j. venaticus is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007) and listed as Critically Endangered.  <br/><br/>The known cheetah population is not much greater than 7,000, and the total population is unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, thus meeting the criteria for Vulnerable.  The current known population is half the 15,000 estimated by Myers (1975) from his continental status assessment.  The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) could be less than half of the total population (Kelly 2001). <br/><br/>While the current rate of population decline is of most concern, and the historical rate of decline has been severe (Nowell and Jackson, 1996; Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005), attention has also focused on the cheetah's having perhaps suffered even more extreme losses in the distant past.  The cheetah species exhibits remarkably low levels of genetic diversity in comparison to other felids (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1986) (but not compared to carnivores in general: Merola 1994).  This is consistent with inbreeding among a very few individuals surviving one or more catastrophic population bottlenecks in the past, with the first possibly occurring during the late Pleistocene extinctions, around 10,000 years ago, according to analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien 1995).  <br/><br/>It is unclear what sort of agent could have caused such an extreme population decline in a wide-ranging species, and alternative explanations have been explored.  Hedrick (1996) suggested the low levels of genetic variation could result from a very low effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population that is actually passing on its genes), and Kelly's (2001) calculations of effective population size in cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains were quite low (44% or less of the actual population).  She found that only a few females contributed disproportionately to future generations by raising offspring which survived and reproduced (Kelly 2001).  Genetic analysis by Gottelli <em>et al.</em> (2007) showed that male cheetahs, on the other hand, passed on their genes more successfully than expected.  Female cheetahs mated with multiple males, many non-resident, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity.  This indicates that rates of genetic loss should be lower than anticipated by Kelly (2001), and underscores the importance of cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.   <br/><br/>While the causes of the cheetah's low levels of genetic variation are unclear, what is clear is that large populations are necessary to conserve it.  Since cheetahs are a low density species, conservation areas need to be quite large, larger than most protected areas.",Stable,"Cheetahs have disappeared from huge areas of their historic range.  They still occur widely, but sparsely, in Africa, but Ray <em>et al.</em> (2005) estimate that the cheetahs have disappeared from 76% of their historic range on the continent.<br/><br/>In Asia, the cheetah has lost almost all its vast historic range, which within the last century extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Habibi 2004; Mallon 2007).  Part of the reason for their disappearance in Asia is live captures of cheetahs, which were trained to hunt for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh, 1995).  The main cause, however, was likely depletion of the wild prey base, especially gazelles, as well as direct killing of cheetahs and development of their habitat (Mallon, 2007).  The Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered.  Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001).  While Habibi (2004) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, a cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, although there has been significant range loss in parts of these regions.  Cheetahs are known to occur only in 6% of their historical range in Eastern Africa (310,586 km²), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (Anon. 2007).  Current distribution in several countries remains largely unknown (Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Angola, Mozambique and Zambia).  Cheetahs are known to be extirpated from large areas in Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi (Anon. 2007, 2008).  In some parts of southern Africa they occur extensively outside protected areas on commercial ranch land where other large predators (lions and hyenas) have been extirpated (Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe) (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined most drastically in northern and western Africa (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).  The subspecies (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information on northwest Africa.  <br/><br/>Cheetah persistence in the eastern Sahara is unlikely.<br/><br/>Cheetahs are possibly extinct in Libya. Specimens were previously collected near the Egyptian border (northeastern part of the country), in Dahra, Sirtica (north-central), Bir Ghazal and Hamada-el-Homra (northwestern). Other records include Fezzan, Khor-el-Gifa, Gikherra (eastern), El Ftaia (near coastal area) and Mizda (Hufnagl 1972). Myers (1975) mentioned that cheetahs were noted in Niger/Libyan borders as well as Niger/Algerian borders. An inquiry with local Tuaregs suggested that the species might not longer be present in Akoukas Mountains (J.-L. Bernezat pers. comm. 2007).  <br/><br/>In Tunisia, cheetahs were formerly reported to roam in sandy expanses south of Chott-el-Djerid, the desert areas south of Foum Tatahouine and the Grand Erg Occidental and its surroundings (Schomber and Kock 1960). There are no recent records on the species in the country which make it presumably extinct. The El-Borma region, near the Algerian boundaries, was probably among the areas where cheetahs have last been seen in 1974 and documented (Louis 1979).  <br/><br/>As far as Egypt is concerned, data collated during the last few decades suggest that cheetahs are extremely rare, if not extinct, in the country. Osborn and Helmy (1980) provided original and literature-based records from the Matrouh Governorate and Sinai. According to Saleh <em>et al</em>. (2001), cheetahs became extinct from most of the Mediterranean coastal region and easily accessible inland habitats of El-Maghra and Siwa oases one decade after being widely distributed in the northern Egyptian Western Desert until the 1970s. The main reasons explaining cheetah extirpation have been attributed to extensive and uncontrolled hunting and the development of coastal lands (Saleh <em>et al</em>. 2001). If not completely vanished, the species is believed to be confined, with a very low density, to the Western Desert and around the Qattara Depression (Saleh <em>et al</em>., 2001; Hoath, 2003). Recent records from North Sinai, including one female and three cubs killed by Bedouin hunters in 1993, as well as one female seen with two cubs in November 1994, have not been verified (Hoath 2003). <br/><br/>In the eastern Sahel and central Africa, there is little current information:<br/><br/>Current cheetah distribution in most of its historic range in Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia are unknown (Anon. 1997).  In Chad, although cheetahs were still present and seen occasionally in Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim in the 1970s (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008). A recent wildlife survey in western and central Chad, including Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve, conducted by the Sahelo-Saharan Interest Group in 2001, failed to detect any cheetah presence in the region (Monfort <em>et al</em>. 2003). In the Central Saharan (northern) part of the country, cheetahs still occur, in very low density, in and around the Ennedi Massif (J. Newby pers. comm. 2008 based on Rava's pers. comm.). There is no information on previously reported populations in the Tibesti Mountains (Central Sahara). In southeastern Chad, cheetahs may still survive to date in Zakouma National Park (population still present in the protected area as of 2006 [N. Vanherle pers. comm. 2008]). <br/><br/>In central Africa, current cheetah distribution in the savanna regions of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo is unknown (Marker 2002).  It is considered extinct in Rwanda and Burundi, and possibly extinct in Nigeria.  Rosevear (1974) underlined the paucity of positive records for Nigeria and mentioned Lake Chad, Yan Tumaki (Katsina Division) and possibly Bauchi Plateau as localities for three specimens kept in the British Museum. Happold (1987) raised the possibility of their occurrence near Cameroonian boundaries, and also in the Yankari Game Reserve (Happold 1987). Recent reports from protected area managers and wildlife traders indicate that a threatened small cheetah population may still range in restricted areas in north-centre and northeastern parts of the country (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2008).","Cheetahs are hunted for sport and trophies, as well as handicrafts products. Live animals are also traded - the global captive cheetah population is not self-sustaining. Pest animals are also removed.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson, 1996. However, a number of countries permit cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock (Purchase <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  In Namibia, for example, one is permitted to retain the skin as long as the killing is reported  (Nowell, 1996).  Such policies may at least permit cheetah killing to be monitored.<br/><br/>Promotion of livestock management regimes which minimize conflict with cheetahs are an important conservation measure, pioneered by the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia (Marker <em>et al.</em>, 2003) but now being applied more widely.  Elements of successful conservation management include availability of wild prey and more intensive livestock herd protection, especially using guard dogs.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Cheetah is protected in Iran. The main protected areas for this species include Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park and Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh P.A., and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge. A radio-telemetry study in Iran is providing the first detailed data on cheetahs in Iran (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Several countries, including Namibia and Kenya, have developed national action plans or conservation strategies for cheetahs (Nowell, 1996; Durant, 2007); regional conservation strategies have been developed for Southern (Dickman <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Anon., 2008) and Eastern Africa (Anon., 2007); and there is also a global strategy (Bartels <em>et al.</em>, 2002).  These plans call for a number of improvements in monitoring, surveys and information exchange (to better understand cheetah distribution and status); promotion of human-cheetah coexistence (to reduce conflict and develop incentives to conserve cheetahs); national land use planning (to ensure viable national cheetah populations); capacity building (to improve management); policy and legislation (to ensure legal consistency and remove loopholes) and advocacy (to raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation needs).<br/><br/>Several specialist networks of cheetah conservationists have been established, including the Global Cheetah Forum (affiliated with the IUCN Conservation Breeding Specialist Group) and the North African Regional Cheetah Action Group (NARCAG/OGRAN).  The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (www.catsg.org)<br/><br/>Important protected areas that represent strongholds for Cheetah populations in Africa include the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa, Botswana), Nxai Pan and Chobe National Parks, and Okavango Delta (Botswana), Etosha N.P. (Namibia), Liuwa Plains N.P. (Zambia), and, of course, the Serengeti N.P. (Tanzania, Kenya) (Caro in press). In West Africa, the major remaining stronghold for the species is the WAPO protected areas complex. There is a surviving population of Cheetah in the Ahaggar National Park in Algeria (Wacher <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>However, most cheetah occur outside of protected areas (where they are often persecuted as pests), and given their need for large areas they require conservation action on a landscape scale (for example, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, zoning for land-use to maintain habitat connectivity, and wild prey restoration) (Marker, 2002; Anon., 2007).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

the wild in the region considered by the Mediterranean regional assessment.","The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby in press). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby in press; and references therein). <br/><br/>Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing. In the Sahel, movements tend to be north-south in direction, i.e., from the more arid desert to the less arid sub-desert and Sahel (Gillet 1965; Newby 1978). In central Niger, movement may also be east-west, i.e., from the open desert towards the better-wooded and more varied habitats of the Aïr and Termit mountains (Hue 1960).","The primary factors in the decline of Addax are uncontrolled hunting and harassment. Drought and the extension of pastoralism into desert lands, thanks to the increase in wells, have also taken a heavy toll (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al.</em> 2005; Newby in press). Demographic factors (very small size of subpopulations, extreme fragmentation) are also expected to have an adverse effect.","Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby in press). Today, the total global population is estimated at probably less than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Bodélé Depression in Chad (Newby in press). Ground and aerial surveys of Termit/Tin Toumma carried out in 2004 (Wacher <em>et al.</em> 2004) indicate a population of between 100 and 200 head. A total count carried out by SOS Faune du Niger in October 2004 returned a figure of 128 Addax for a little under 10,000 km² of prime habitat in Termit, Niger (see Newby in press). Otherwise, Addax seem to retain a highly fragmented distribution, based on sightings of individuals and small groups.",,"Addax were formerly widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley, and present in suitable habitats in all countries sharing the Sahara Desert (Newby in press). As with other ungulates of the Sahelo-Saharan fauna, the Addax has undergone an unprecedented reduction in geographical range over the past century. Today, the only known remaining population survives in the Termit/Tin Toumma region of Niger. However, there are sporadic records of small isolated groups and individuals from eastern Air Mountains/Western Ténéré desert in Niger, and from the Equey region of western Chad (Newby in press). Possible rare vagrants from these areas may be seen in north Niger, southern Algeria and Libya (Newby in press). There are continued rumours of Addax along the Mali/Mauritania border (Majabat Al Koubra), but no confirmed sightings for several years. However, in early March, 2007, the fresh tracks of about 15 Addax were seen in central Mauritania, in an area where they had not been reported for over 20 years (R.

Continued support for gazetted reserves in Chad and Niger, together with the establishment of new protected areas, especially along the Mali/Mauritania frontier (Majabat), Niger (Termit/Tin Toumma) and Chad (Bodélé, Egueï), is essential, but must be supported and combined with programmes to create incentives for the local people to protect wildlife wherever it is found (Newby in press).<br/><br/>Addax have been reintroduced to fenced sectors of protected areas in Tunisia (Bou Hedma NP) and Morocco (Souss-Massa: 70 animals released 1994-97, increased to c. 550 by 2007; Cuzin <em>et al</em>. in press).

They have been recorded to 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). Almost exclusively grazers, Hartebeests feed selectively in medium-height grassland; they are less water dependant than other alcelaphines, but nonetheless dependent on the availability of surface drinking water.","Hartebeest have decreased markedly in numbers across their range, and their distribution has been increasingly fragmented, as a result of over-hunting for meat and the expansion of settlement and livestock. As has already occurred over much of the rest of the species' former range, some key populations are currently decreasing because of poaching, and/or other factors such as drought and disease in some cases. In Comoé N.P., for example, numbers declined by 60% from 18,300 in 1984 to an estimated 5,200 in 1998 (Fischer and Linsenmair 2001). The distributions of most Hartebeest subspecies are likely to become increasingly fragmented until they are confined to those areas where there is effective control of poaching and encroachment by livestock and settlement.","East (1999) estimated the total populations of Hartebeest at about 362,000 animals (including Lichtenstein's). However, this total is clearly influenced by the number of surviving Red Hartebeest in southern Africa, which East (1999) estimated to number about 130,000 (with 40% on private land and 25% in protected areas). In contrast, less than 600 Swayne's Hartebeest survive in Ethiopia, with the overwhelming majority of the population in the Senkelle sanctuary and Mazie N.P. (Refera 2005). Estimates of population size for the remaining subspecies are: 36,000 Western Hartebeest (&gt;95% in and around protected areas); 70,000 Lelwel (about 40% in protected areas); 3,500 Kenya hartebeest (6% in protected areas and most of the rest on ranchland); 82,000 Lichtenstein's Hartebeest; and 42,000 Coke's Hartebeest (about 70% in protected areas). The surviving number of Tora Hartebeest is unknown, but is unlikely to be more than a few hundred individuals. <br/><br/>The Lelwel Hartebeest may have undergone a major decline since the 1980s, when its total numbers were estimated to be &gt;285,000, mainly in CAR and southern Sudan (East 1999). Recent survey work conducted in the dry season estimated totals of 1070 and 115 animals for Southern N. P. and Boma N.P., respectively (Fay <em>et al.</em> 2007); the latter is a significant decline from the more than 50,000 animals estimated in the dry season in 1980 by Fryxell (1980).",,"Hartebeest formerly ranged from North Africa and the Middle East throughout the savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa and the miombo woodlands of south-central Africa down to the tip of southern Africa; they are absent only from desert and forest, notably the Sahara and the western rainforest (Gosling and Capellini in press). <br/><br/>In North Africa, the Bubal Hartebeest occurred in Morocco, Algeria, southern Tunisia, Libya, and parts of the Western Desert in Egypt (the precise southern limits of distribution are not known). Bubal Hartebeest are now Extinct, the last animals having been shot between 1945 and 1954 in Algeria (De Smet 1989). The last report from south-eastern Morocco was in 1945 (Panouse 1957).<br/><br/>The historical and current ranges of the remaining subspecies can be summarized as follows (after East 1999 and Gosling and Capellini in press):<br/><br/>Western Hartebeest ranged from Senegal eastwards to western Central African Republic and south-west Chad, although they have always been marginal in these last two countries. They have disappeared from much of their former range in this region, surviving mainly in and around protected areas; they no longer occur in The Gambia (though migrants may enter from Senegal).<br/><br/>Tora Hartebeest formerly occurred in western and southwestern Eritrea, north-western Ethiopia and the adjacent border regions of Sudan; they may survive in low numbers in the savannas of Eritrea and some inaccessible parts of Ethiopia, but are probably extinct in Sudan.<br/><br/>Swayne's Hartebeest occurred throughout the Rift Valley in Ethiopia into northwest Somalia, but now survive in four isolated localities: Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, Nechisar N.P., Awash N.P. and the newly designated Mazie N.P. (Refera 2005). They are otherwise extinct outside Ethiopia. <br/><br/>Lelwel Hartebeest ranged from southern Chad through Central African Republic, southern Sudan, northern and north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, south-western Ethiopia, north-west Kenya, northern Uganda and extreme north-western Tanzania. They have undergone dramatic reductions in numbers particularly in Uganda and Central African Republic, where they are now reduced to a few protected areas. <br/><br/>Coke's Hartebeest occurred widely throughout southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. They have lost much of their range, but populations still occur in the Serengeti and Tarangire in Tanzania and Tsavo, and the Mara in Kenya.<br/><br/>Lichtenstein's Hartebeest formerly occurred widely in the miombo woodlands of south-central Africa (probably as far south as KwaZulu-Natal), but now occur mainly in wildlife areas in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia; they are extinct in Burundi. <br/><br/>Red Hartebeest occurred throughout much of southern Africa (and marginally into Angola near the Namibian border), and although much reduced by European colonists, they are now expanding their range again as they have been reintroduced into many protected areas and private game farms (and widely introduced outside their former range).",The Hartebeest is hunted for food and sport.

However, there may nevertheless be cause for concern in north-western mainland Russia, where population densities apparently are low and have failed to recover despite a decrease in hunting pressure. Little is known about the arctic fox in this region, and more information (and action) is urgently needed.<br/><br/>Within the EU, the arctic fox is found only in Sweden and Finland, where its total population numbers at most 50-70 animals. In Sweden the population is very small but appears to have stabilized, whereas in Finland no breeding has been recorded since 2000 and the population can be assumed to be decreasing. Fennoscandian populations are all tiny and highly fragmented, so no rescue effect should be expected from outside the EU. Consequently the species qualifies as Critically Endangered (D1, C2a(i)).<br/><br/>Arctic foxes in Fennoscandia are isolated from other populations, and thus can be described as a subpopulation (according to global Red List guidelines). Within that subpopulation there are a number of further isolated subpopulations, each numbering less than 50 individuals. The Fennoscandian subpopulation is assessed as Critically Endangered under Criterion C2a(i), as it numbers <250 mature individuals, and there are ongoing declines (although populations in Norway and Sweden are relatively stable, the Finnish population is declining).","The species is confined to arctic and alpine tundra, above or north of the treeline. The arctic fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger, but in most inland areas the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. In Fennoscandia, the Norwegian lemming <em>Lemmus lemmus</em> was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds and reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (Frafjord 1995, Elmhagen <em>et al.</em> 2000). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1995, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1999). The typical response to lemming peak-years is an increase in both the number of litters and litter size (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996).  Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy especially in areas without cyclic rodent populations (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996, Dalerum and Angerbjörn 2000, Eide <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Iceland, lamb carcasses frequently are found among prey remains at dens resulting in the species being considered a pest. Although individual foxes may indeed prey on lambs, it is more likely that a large proportion of the lambs have been scavenged (Hersteinsson 1996). Arctic foxes are known to prey on wildfowl (Eide <em>et al.</em> 2005) and occasionally kill reindeer calves (Prestrud 1992a). <br/><br/>Foxes reach sexual maturity at 10 months, and the average lifespan for animals that reach adulthood is approximately three years (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2004). In more stable coastal environments the average age is probably higher (Prestrud 1992a). Arctic fox life history traits reflect adaptations to differing constraints in resource availability. Arctic foxes in unstable environments (e.g., habitats dominated by cyclic prey) have higher litter size but do not reproduce every year, whereas arctic foxes in stable environments (e.g., coastal habitats with bird cliffs), have a smaller litter size but reproduce every year (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2004). Social organization (home range size and territoriality) and hence local density of arctic fox is also highly influenced by resource availability; home range sizes range from 10 km<sup>2</sup> in stable coastal habitats up to 52 km<sup>2</sup> in more fluctuating environments (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1997, Strand <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eide <em>et al.</em> 2004). Hence predictable coastal habitats support a denser population of foxes compared to more unpredictable habitats. Arctic foxes tend to be territorial, with a mated pair occupying a common territory (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1986, Prestrud 1992b, Landa <em>et al.</em> 1998, Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996, Eide <em>et al.</em> 2004). Additional, but non-reproductive adults may also be present within the territory even though their function as “helpers” may be somewhat limited. In some rare cases it has been observed that two adult females will reproduce within the same territory (Strand <em>et al.</em> 2000, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bodil Elmhagen pers. comm.). As a result of these home range sizes and territorial social organisation typical densities can vary from 20 adults per 100 km<sup>2</sup> to 2-4 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. A noticeable feature of arctic fox ecology is dependence on and year round use of dens. These dens are normally excavated in sandy soil and can reach a considerable size (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Dalerum <em>et al.</em> 2002, Frafjord 2003). After several decades, or even centuries, of use they can acquire many tens of openings. In areas without sandy deposits foxes use crevices in cliffs or moraines as dens (Prestrud 1992b).","Globally the large populations on the continental tundra of Alaska, Canada and Siberia (except Kola) and the island of Greenland are all harvested by trapping or shooting. The main motivation is for fur, although they are killed around settlements in parts of Greenland to reduce the risk of rabies being spread to sled dogs and humans. There is nothing that indicates that these populations are currently threatened by overharvest. The small population on the Komandor islands is threatened by a form of mange (<em>Otodectes cynotis</em>: Goltsman <em>et al.</em> 1996).<br/><br/>In Europe the threats vary between regions.<br/><br/>The animals occupying <strong>western Siberia</strong> are exposed to trapping, but nothing indicates that this is representing an immediate threat. There is no other information available about threats to this population.<br/><br/>On <strong>Svalbard</strong> arctic foxes are trapped, but the extent of this trapping is limited to areas close to settlements, and it is therefore not regarded as a threat (Fuglei <em>et al.</em> 1998). Possible threats include accumulation of long distance transported pollutants and climate change, which may influence sea ice conditions in the future. The arctic fox on Svalbard (Norway) has higher levels of  persistent organic pollutants (POPs)  than foxes in other parts of the arctic (Norheim 1978, Wang-Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1993, Fuglei <em>et al.</em> 2007). The levels are similar to those found in polar bears from Svalbard and Greenland (Verreault <em>et al.</em> 2005). Such high concentrations of contaminants may have possible toxic health effects. The island Bjørnøya holds a small, recently re-established population of arctic foxes, while no foxes have been reported on Jan Mayen since before 1998 (E. Fuglei pers comm. 2007). Arctic foxes on these islands are protected and the main threat appears to be lack of influx of new animals and the extremely small population size. These islands were part of the Svalbard metapopulation, as sea ice allowed connectivity. Climate change through reduction in the extent of the sea ice might in fact explain why the arctic fox has not re-established on Jan Mayen (E. Fuglei pers comm. 2007).<br/><br/><br/>On <strong>Iceland</strong> the status of arctic fox has changed. Historically they were heavily persecuted because of the belief that they were involved in depredation on livestock. Recent legislation has restricted harvest and the population is increasing (Hersteinsson 2006), although in many areas they are still hunted year round.<br/><br/>In <strong>Fennoscandia</strong> arctic foxes are scattered along the peninsula in very small populations that are relatively isolated from each other. The alpine tundra habitat is naturally fragmented, but the degree of population fragmentation has increased due to the extinction of local populations. The populations have not increased despite over 75 years of protection. <br/><br/>Overexploitation due to hunting and trapping was most probably the originate threat and the reason behind the dramatic decline of arctic foxes in Fennoscandia (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Hersteinsson <em>et al.</em> 1989, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1995, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). The value of arctic fox fur together with high grants for killing foxes gave motivation for this strong persecution. In 1924 Norwegian trappers could get 25% more than an average year's salary for a peasant for only one skin (Østbye and Pedersen 1990). Establishment of the fox farm industry at the beginning of 1900 probably also forced the decline further. Live trapping of foxes also continued also after protection. Arctic fox den sites are easy to spot and several dens were dug out during the sixties to catch cubs to bring in to fur farms (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978).     <br/><br/>The exact reason why the population in not responding to protection is not understood, but a range of factors are believed to be involved, including:<br/><br/>Intraguild competition with red foxes. Red fox populations have increased and expanded in range throughout the 20th century, both in the boreal region and above the treeline to alpine tundra habitat (Selås and Vik 2006, Elmhagen <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is known that they have occupied former arctic fox dens in the most productive, low lying areas (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Frafjord 2003, Tannerfeldt <em>et al.</em> 2002, Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). Red foxes occupy the same niche and eat the same prey as arctic foxes (Elmhagen <em>et al.</em> 2002), they can kill arctic fox pups and adults (Frafjord <em>et al.</em> 1989, Tannerfeldt <em>et al.</em> 2002), and arctic foxes avoid breeding close to red foxes (Tannerfeldt <em>et al.</em> 2002). Therefore the potential for a negative effect is clearly present.<br/><br/>Genetics. The remaining arctic fox populations are all very small and relatively isolated from each other. Today the population consists of four genetically distinct subpopulations with very little exchange of dispersing animals (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2002, Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2006). Therefore the potential for inbreeding is high. So far there are no obvious signs of inbreeding depression but individual genetic variation was negatively associated with fitness (Dalén <em>et al.</em> unpublished). Although there is still a surprisingly high degree of variation, by comparison with historical samples it is clear that 25% of the variation has been lost (Nyström <em>et al.</em> 2006). Hybridization with arctic foxes that have escaped from fur farms has also been documented.  Genetic mapping revealed hybridization of genotypes originating from escaped farm foxes (Norén <em>et al.</em> 2005), mixing in haplotypes not found in the wild Fennoscandian arctic fox (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2005). The amount of reported escapes of farm foxes has increased in recent years and even breeding has been observed (N.E. Eide pers. comm. 2006). However at present demographic stochasticity probably remains a greater threat than inbreeding.<br/><br/>Small population size. The small size of populations directly increases their individual risks of extinction, especially when they occupy a fluctuating environment with strong year to year variation in the probability of reproducing (Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Loison <em>et al.</em> 2001). Extinction risk is further increased by fragmentation, which reduces the chance of rescue effects occurring (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Climate change. Projected climate change would intensify fragmentation of the Fennoscandian mountain plateau even further, and may exclude the arctic fox from lower lying alpine tundra areas. For a review of the potential impacts of climate change on arctic foxes see Ims and Fuglei (2005).","The world population of arctic foxes is in the order of several hundred thousand animals (see Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004 for specific details). Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers. The species is common in the tundra areas of Russia, Canada, coastal Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Exceptions are Fennoscandia, Mednyi Island (Komandor Islands, Russia) and the Pribilof Islands, where populations are at critically low levels (Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>The situation in Europe varies between areas. It is most realistic to consider the four geographic areas of occurrence separately:<br/><br/><strong>Western Siberia (from the White Sea to Novaya Zemlya).</strong> There are no reliable data about arctic fox numbers from this region, although Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimate that the total Russian population (including eastern Siberia) could potentially be in the order of 200,000-800,000 animals. In general in Western Russia, the species is sparse on the mainland but common on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, where some thousands of animals can be estimated on the each island (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006). Although the hunting pressure on this species is now very low all over Russia, mainland populations may not have recovered from historical overhunting (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Svalbard.</strong> There has been no total census of arctic foxes on this archipelago, but the population is known to be numerous and stable. The arctic fox went extinct on the island Bjørnøya (part of the Svalbard archipelago) and on Jan Mayen (an isolated island further south between Svalbard and Iceland). The two populations were severely depleted following early 20th century extermination efforts (Fuglei <em>et al.</em> 1998). On  Bjørnøya  the arctic fox population has re-established by immigration over sea ice in recent years, and breeding is again documented, while no foxes have been observed on Jan Mayen since before 1998 (E. Fuglei pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/><strong>Iceland.</strong> Numbers of arctic foxes on Iceland have fluctuated as a result of differing management practices. From a low point in the 1970s of around 1,300 individuals, the population reached 8,000 individuals in 2003 and is still increasing (Hersteinsson 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Fennoscandia.</strong> Arctic foxes were once very abundant throughout the alpine tundra habitats of Fennoscandia, but were greatly reduced due to over-harvesting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They have basically never recovered, despite having been protected for over 75 years (Østbye <em>et al.</em> 1978, Hersteinsson <em>et al.</em> 1989, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). The most recent estimate is 120 adults in Norway, Sweden and Finland, around 50 of which are found in Sweden (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005), 50 in Norway (Frafjord and Rofstad 1998, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 1999), and 5-15 in Finland (Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005). The population on the Kola peninsula has not been accurately censused. Estimates range from c.40 individuals (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005), and less than 100 individuals (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006), to 1,000-2,000 animals (Potansky 1993). The latter figure is considered likely to be an overestimate (Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004). Genetic research showed that the Arctic fox in Scandinavia presently is subdivided into four subpopulations, and that the Kola Peninsula and northwest Russia together form a large fifth subpopulation. Current dispersal between the subpopulations seems to be very low (Dalén <em>et al.</em> 2006). The population trend in Norway and Sweden is stable, but in Finland the population can be assumed to be decreasing as there has been no breeding documented since 2000 (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006).",Stable,"Arctic foxes have a circumpolar distribution (Corbet 1978, Hall 1981, Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990, Pulliainen 1999, Wilson and Ruff 1999), occurring in three distinct ecological situations. Arctic foxes are found throughout the area of <strong>continental tundra</strong> that covers the northern coasts of Alaska, Canada and Siberia. They occur on most of the <strong>arctic islands</strong> including all islands of the Canadian high arctic, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Jan Mayen, Bjørnøya, Novaya Zemlja, Wrangel Island, and the Komandor Islands (in addition, they have been introduced to some of the Aleutian Islands: Bailey 1992). Thirdly, they occur on the <strong>alpine tundra</strong> that occurs on the mountain ranges found along the spine of the Scandinavian peninsula (including the Kola region). Arctic foxes are also observed in the open drift ice. In a pan-European context arctic foxes occur in four geographic areas that represent all three ecological situations – continental tundra in western Siberia (Russia), arctic islands in Svalbard (Norway) and Iceland, and alpine tundra in Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola peninsula of Russia). Southern and altitudinal limitations on its global distribution is most probably set by intraguild competition with the larger red fox (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1992). In Europe Arctic foxes occur from sea level to 1,500 m (N.E. Eide pers. comm. 2007).",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Occurrence in protected areas</strong><br/>Good information is available for Norway, Sweden and Finland. For Iceland, Arctic foxes could potentially appear in most protected areas (Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>Norway: The National Parks Blåfjell-Skjækerfjella, Børgefjell, Saltfjellet, Øvre Dividal, Reisa.

In most of its range, the arctic fox is not protected under national legislation. However, the species and its dens have had total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the arctic fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE). <br/><br/><strong>Conservation measures taken</strong><br/>Action plans based on status reports have been developed for arctic foxes in Sweden (Löfgren and Angerbjörn 1998) and Norway (Direktoratet for Naturforvaltning 2003), and a status report has also been published for Finland (Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Sweden and Finland, a species-specific conservation project has been completed (SEFALO), and a second is under way (SEFALO+), the latter also involving work in Norway (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005). Measures taken include den monitoring (and protection of den sites by excluding ptarmigan hunting in Sweden only), supplementary feeding, red fox control, disease research, as well as building public awareness and education work (Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Norway a captive breeding programme on arctic foxes was started in 2000 and extended in 2007. The first successful captive reproduction and release of foxes happened in 2006 (A. Landa pers. comm. 2006). A research programme on red fox control was started in northern Norway in 2004. Programmes to build public awareness have also been started in Norway by non-governmental organizations (www.fjellrev.no). A number of research projects on the arctic fox are underway, of which further details can be found in Sillero-Zubiri <em>et al.</em> (2004).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

Population reduction due to habitat loss has been exacerbated by hunting, which has resulted in the extirpation of small- to medium-sized sub-populations and continues to be a significant threat, even in protected areas.","The species inhabits submontane and montane evergreen tropical forest of the Atlantic coast of Brazil. According to Aguirre (1971), <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> is found in montane forests between 400-1,880 meters asl, in well-preserved remnants of seasonal and evergreen forests. Recent data indicate the resilience of the taxon in subtropical/tropical montane and deciduous evergreen forests, between 400-1,880 m asl (Talebi in prep). Studies on dietary requirements and feeding ecology were conducted in the Fazenda Barreiro Rico by Milton (1984) and Martins (2003a,b, 2005b, 2006), in the Intervales State Park (Petroni 1993, 2000) and in the Carlos Botelho State Park (Moraes 1992a,b; Lucas <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2016; Ganzhorn <em>et al.</em> 2009; Talebi 2005; Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2016; Talebi 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Size:</strong><br/>Adult male size: 1.57 m crown rump size (Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2016)<br/>Adult female size: 1.44 m crown rump size (Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2016)<br/>Adult male weight: 9.1 kg (n=7) (Talebi and Lee 2010)<br/>Adult female weight: 8.3 kg (n=4) (Talebi and Lee 2010)","Historically, forest loss and hunting have been the two most significant threats to <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em>.<br/><br/>Estimates of the original distribution of the genus <em>Brachyteles</em> are based in large part on the studies of Aguirre (1971), undertaken nearly 50 years ago. Recent Spatial Distribution Modelling (SDM) estimates the species’ original area of occupancy (AOO) at 345,760 km², within which only 20,611 km² of suitable habitat remains, representing what must be regarded as an irreversible loss of 96% (Ingberman <em>et al</em>. 2016). Deforestation has occurred largely due to an expanding agricultural frontier, cattle ranching, urbanization and development.<br/><br/>The current population of the Southern Muriqui is believed to be less than 1,200 individuals surviving in 20 isolated, subpopulations in a mixture of private, municipal, state and national protected areas in the states of Rio de Janeiro (6), Sao Paulo (12) and Parana&#160; (2) (Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Of the subpopulations, one (Carlos Botelho State Park) is believed to contain between 100 and 250 mature individuals, while three (Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve) are believed to contain between 50 and 100 mature individuals (Strier <em>et al</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Hunting has been severe in past decades and continues to be a significant threat, even within officially protected areas. Since the first regional survey of the two <em>Brachyteles </em>species was conducted nearly 60 years ago, the extirpation of at least a dozen former populations of the Southern Muriqui is believed to have occurred (Aguirre 1971, Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1998, Melo <em>et al</em>. 2005, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Talebi, pers. comm).","<em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> is now known to survive in 20 localities: 12 in São Paulo State, two in Parana State, and six in Rio de Janeiro State. The estimated total population is 1,100-1,200 individuals, inhabiting a combination of national, state, municipal and private protected areas, as well as unprotected forests (Talebi and Soares 2016, Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest subpopulations are those of Carlos Botelho State Park, Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve. Several of the subpopulations in São Paulo State exist in small, isolated forest patches and their long-term viability is questionable, while the sub-populations of Tres Picos, Desengano State Park, Cunhambebe State and Serra da Bocaina National Park may actually be larger than previously estimated (Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, a significant number of subpopulations identified by Aguirre (1971) have apparently been extirpated.",Decreasing,"The geographic distribution of <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> ranges from the northeast region of Paraná along the central and eastern region of São Paulo State and the southern region of Rio de Janeiro (Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011). To the north it occurs as far as the southern margin of the Paraíba do Sul River and to the west of this river, it could have reached the south-eastern parts of Minas Gerais on the southern slopes of the Serra da Mantiqueira. One population still exists in the delta of the Piracicaba and Tiete Rivers.<br/><br/>Its stronghold today is in the southern region of Sâo Paulo State, in the montane forests of the Serra de Paranapiacaba (Talebi 2005, Talebi and Soares 2005). Based on Koehler <em>et al</em>. (2005) the species’ range in Paraná State is restricted to the south by the Ribeira de Iguape River and to the west by the Campo Biome. Within this range, there are only two populations remaining, one at Castro Municipality and another in Doutor Ulysses Municipality. Throughout the region, the only remnant forest of any considerable size is that of the Lauráceas State Park (23,000 ha), in a montane region of the Municipalities of Adrianópolis and Tunas do Paraná (Ingberman 2015). In São Paulo State, there are three main strongholds for the species. These are the Serra de Paranapiacaba, in the dense montane forests of&#160; the Municipalities of São Miguel Arcanjo and Capão Bonito, the Carlos Botelho State Park (24°15-44’S, 47°46-48°10´W), and the Fundação Florestal do Estado de São Paulo. Additional field sites protecting known subpopulations in the region include a protected private reserve, i.e., the Muriqui Ecopark (Pró-Muriqui Association), and two corporate private business areas, i.e., Fazenda São Miguel Klabin and Legado das Águas Reserve Votorantim. These areas represent the core areas of the World Heritage Site Atlantic Forest South-East Reserves (decreed in 1999 and considered of outstanding universal value in 2015).<br/><br/>For the Serra do Mar region containing the largest protected area of São Paulo, the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar is supposed to protect the species. Although several areas have been proven to have experienced local extinctions, the exact distributional status of the species in the region is unknown, but is certainly declining. In the Serra da Mantiqueira, bordering the States of Minas Gerais and São Paulo, a few remnants of forest still remain and only two localities, the São Sebastião Fibria Farm (22°45´S 45°28´W) and the region of São Francisco Xavier (23°12’S 45°52’W) are confirmed as current areas in which the species survives. In addition, the last remnant of interior deciduous forest, the Barreiro Rico Farm, contains a vanishing population in the municipality of Anhembi, located in the deltas of the Tiete and Piracicaba Rivers (Talebi and Soares 2005, Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2016).

In 2015, São Paulo State launched the Pró-Primatas Comission, a permanent commission responsible for elaborating conservation policies for state-wide action on threatened primate species.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ex situ</em> conservation</strong>:<br/>Captive breeding has been problematic due to low levels of reproduction and poor infant survival. There is a small, but promising, captive breeding programme for the species in Sorocaba Zoo, which has been successful on maintaining the species. There also exists the continued <em>ex situ</em> program for the species at Rio de Janeiro Primate Center (Coimbra- Filho <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pissinatti <em>et al.</em> 1998, Pissinatti 2005) but none of these institutions has been successful in regularly generating or maintaining offspring. The National Action Plan Muriqui established three reference institutions for captive breeding of the species, i.e., Sorocaba Zoo (São Paulo), Passeio Publico Zoo, Curitiba (Paraná), and Rio de Janeiro Primate Centre.&#160; Some zoos in São Paulo (e.g., Sorocaba and Santos) receive wild-born muriqui pets every year, originating mostly from palm-harvesters and hunters who have killed the mothers. Conservation planning for a dedicated breeding program in São Paulo State would greatly enhance our understanding of southern muriquis as well as providing a backup for population extinctions in the wild.<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The population is suspected to continue declining at a similar rate over the next 40 years, primarily due to continuing and suspected increased threats such as hunting and habitat loss.<span lang=""ES-TRAD""></p>","<p>This species ranges from tropical semi­evergreen forest to tropical wet evergreen forest and tropical moist deciduous forest. It prefers dense evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). Srivastava and Mohnot (2001) report it from lowland semi­evergreen forests to monsoon and montane forests. In India, it occurs at elevations of 50­2-700m (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003; Choudhury 2001, 2002; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001), between 200 and 2,200 m in Myanmar (Htun pers. comm.), and up to 2,400 m in China (X. Jiang pers. comm.); in Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia it is predominantly found above 400 m, while in karst limestone environments it is found in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is considered arboreal as well as terrestrial, and is diurnal. It feeds primarily on seeds and fruits. It has a generation time of 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003). It eats fruit, insects, small vertebrates, and immature leaves, and will also raid crops for potatoes and rice. It occurs widely in the hill and mountain areas of VietNam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). In Thailand it is widespread but discontinuous, in forests associated with limestone, and other forest habitats (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). In China it is found in broadleaved evergreen forests, and sometimes in secondary forests close to farmlands (X. Jiang pers. comm).<br/><br/>Long-term study in India reported that the species consume highest 23.65% of time on feeding of seeds, 21.81% in fruits, 14.22% in leaves and twigs, 10.35% in root and tubers. Moreover, they spent 8.09% in bamboo shoots and 7.79% in feeding other minor food items&#160; (Chetry and Chetry 2015).<br/><br/>Stump-tailed Macaque is very selective over the lodging trees it chooses; in India it has been found to use only six species of tree for lodging (Chetry and<strong>&#160;</strong>Bhattacharjee 2004).<br/><br/>The species is also found in lower altitudes; a young individual was captured in Cachar, Assam from 60 m asl. The elevation of Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary is just above 100 m. &#160;Climate varies from tropical to subtropical across the macaques in distribution. The species is good swimmer, but is terrestrial in habit.<br/><br/>It has been known to feed on vegetable materials, fruits, seeds, flowers, leaves, roots, tubers, cultigens like rice and corns, and opportunistic feeders on insects, frogs, birds, bird eggs and freshwater crabs.<br/><br/>Mean gestation: 177.3 days. Interbirth interval of 1.6 years. Diurnal in activity. Home ranges as measured in Jorhat District is 336-587 ha. Daily movement differs from one place to another: 2-3kms in Yunnan, China and 1.8-2.3km in Assam, India. Group size could be as small as 2-3 individuals or as big as 60-150 individuals.</p>","<p>Habitat disturbances affecting this species' survival include selective logging, timber and firewood collection for charcoal, building roads, dams, power lines and fisheries, deliberately set fires, fragmentation, and soil loss/erosion. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine,” and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In India much of its habitat is affected by Jhum cultivation (shifting or slash­and­burn) (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). It has also been indiscriminately hunted over almost its entire distribution in India (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). The vulnerability of being hunted is due to large body size and terrestrial in habit (Chetry and Das pers.com)<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is heavily targeted for use in traditional “medicine,” both in country and for trade with China. Agriculture, hydropower and mining developments are the other threats that need to be watched.<br/><br/>Within Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting levels for food is also very high. Habitat loss is a relatively lower threat compared to hunting (R. Timmins pers. comm).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, where Stump-tailed Macaques are found only in three of 24 sites, are yet threatened by concession mining, and land mining are existing threats even in protected areas.<br/><br/>In Laos, the species suffers from opportunistic hunting in their area of occurrence across the country for supply of bones for 'medicinal' use in Vietnam is threatening the population. Logging, gold mining and shifting cultivation are accounted as some direct threats. Other threats include extensive poaching and earlier were used in manufacturing polio medicine. Poaching for traditional medicine is still on unabated and therefore pressing the remaining population. Absence of any new conservation measure is in not helping the situation either.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, logging and timber extraction are major threats. Commercial rubber plantations, hunting, and trade of animals parts with China are all major threats to this species. In China, hunting and habitat loss have reduced in population of this species, and it is locally extinct in some places. Over hunting might have extirpated the population in Guangdong Province. Habitat loss from plundering of evergreen broad leaf forest is a serious threat. In Thailand, habitat loss is a major threat, while hunting is prevalent, but not a significant threat to the species (R. Boonratana pers. comm). Until 1976, until the ban on international trade in 1976 of primates, trade and export of Stump-tailed Macaque was well and active. The United States of America alone imported <em>ca</em> 30,000 primates from Thailand, mostly macaques, for use in biomedical research and some were famously sold as ‘miniature chimpanzees’. The population in peninsular Thailand was thus significantly reduced due to this trapping for trade and export. Large scale farming, plantations, marine product use resulting in habitat loss and habitat degradation has also affected the population.</p>","<p>Populations in South Asia and in Myanmar are few and fragmented (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003; S.Htun pers. comm.). This species is suspected to be extinct in Bangladesh, having last been recorded there in 1989 (M. Feeroz pers. comm.). It is very scarce all over its range in north eastern India, however, it is common in the mountains of Nagaland, Manipur, and eastern Mizoram (Choudhury 2001). In India the protected areas it is found in are - Arunachal Pradesh- Mehao WLS, Namdapha National Park, Assam- Barail Wildlife Sanctuary and Reserved Forest, Innerline Reserved Forest, Hollongapar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Meghalaya-Balpakram National Park, Nokrek National Park, Mizoram- Murlen National Park; (Choudhury 2002; Das and Chetry pers. com.) In China the species is still common in Yunnan, though the populations are thought to be lower in the eastern portions of its range but recent record suggest that there is still existence of the species in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>China: In 2015, 23,000 individuals were estimated in China’s National survey on mammal populations (Long and Jiang pers. comm).  </p><p>India: &lt;1,000 individual estimated in the south bank of river Brahmaputra and east of Dibang River in Northeast India and it is critical in India (Chetry and Das pers. comm) many places, the populations have gone extinct locally (Chang pers. comm). </p>  <p>There are no available population estimates for this taxon in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm.), although the population is likely to be large, as the species is frequently encountered throughout the range of distribution in these countries.<br/><br/>Populations of this species are critically threatened in India, declining in Myanmar, stable in Thailand and China, and declining in Viet Nam. There are some declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia. Future declines are predicted to be faster in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, India, Myanmar and China due to habitat loss and/or hunting. <br/><br/>The population is declining rapidly in India except in the few protect areas, in fact, the species has been extirpated outside the protected areas except in few reserve forests (Chetry and Das pers. comm).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Cambodia, south­western China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces), north­eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura states), Lao PDR, north­western Peninsular Malaysia, northern Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. It appears that some occur on the border between Tripura and Chittagong Hill Tracks as confirmed in February 2016. The macaques were on the both sides of the border. There are also&#160;a few dubious records in central and north­western Thailand. It was formerly found in eastern Bangladesh as well, but the species has vanished from most parts of its former range in Bangladesh. In China, it is found south of 25°N. The species has been introduced to Hong Kong. In north­eastern India, it was long believed to be restricted to the south bank of the Brahmaputra River (Choudhury 1988),&#160;Namdapha is also on the south/east bank of the Brahmaputra and is a known stronghold of the species.&#160;However, it is to be seen whether it occurs north of the Lohit River, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra from where there are unconfirmed reports.&#160;Srivastava and Mohnot (2001), J. Das (pers. comm.) and Chetry <em>et al.</em> (2003) report possible records of this species from Namdapha National Park, though they were morphologically distinct from other representatives of the species, and could represent an undescribed subspecies. Introduced in Hong Kong.</p>","The species is hunted for for food, 'medicine', pet trade and sport hunting.",Terrestrial,"<p>Internationally, this species is listed under Appendix II in CITES. Regionally, India lists it as schedule II under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001) amended up to 2002. In Indian context the species facing severe threats with few populations left and needs revision of the Indian status so that in can get better protection. The species is also protected in national wildlife acts of Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Thailand, and Myanmar.<br/><br/>Stump­-tailed Macaques are found in a number of protected areas throughout their range, including: Nokrek Nationa Park, Balpakram National Park, Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary, Hollongapar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, Murlen National Park (India); Huay Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Thailand).

Much like the study on Bonnet Macaques (a similar species) indicated steep declines in populations due to persecution and commensal populations becoming sinks over the last few decades, <em>Macaca fascicularis </em>is also suspected to have undergone declines of over 30% throughout its range in the last 36-39 years (three generations). Ignorance and lack of conservation action on an apparent ""abundantly"" seen species will continue to impact its status in the future, therefore we expect a reduction of at least 30% to also occur over the next 36-39 years.</p>","The species is extremely tolerant of a range of habitats, including mangrove and swamp forests, and can be found in agricultural areas near forest (secondary growth, secondary forest, and primary forest) (Thomas 1898; Fooden 1991,1995; Rabor 1986; Goodman and Ingle 1993; Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1991; Rickart <em>et al</em>. 1993; Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Nicobars, <em>M. f. umbrosus</em> is found in mangroves and coastal forests dominated by <em>Pandanus</em> species (Molur <em>et al</em>., 2003). <em>M. f. aureus</em> is found in evergreen forests and coastal mangroves (Molur <em>et al.,</em> 2003). The species has been reported as occurring to elevations of up to 1,000 m on Java, Borneo, and Sumatra (Indonesia), and up to 1,800 m in the Philippines (Heaney <em>et al.,</em> 1998). On the mainland, it generally occurs at lower elevations: up to 700 m in Thailand, while in Cambodia and Viet Nam it generally occurs below 300 m. This species is semi-terrestrial, diurnal, and omnivorous (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).","<p>Across much of the range, the major threat to the species is hunting. In mainland Southeast Asia, such as in Cambodia and Viet Nam, females are taken into breeding facilities and males are exported internationally primarily for use in laboratory research. A potential related issue is the release of confiscated long-tailed macaques from the border area of Viet Nam and China (which is where most of the current international trade is being recorded) into the native range of other macaque species. In the Philippines, the species is subject to a high level of hunting, where it is taken for local consumption and hunted for sport. It is also persecuted as a pest. Habitat loss is also a localised threat, but the species can persist in a variety of habitats and very adaptable.</p>","This is a widespread and often abundant species, and is sometimes commensal with humans. In the Philippines, it ranges from being locally common to uncommon, though this is largely dependent upon hunting pressure. In Bangladesh, the population has been estimated at less than 100 total individuals, and a population on the Teknaf Peninsula has been completely decimated due to development activities (ship-building) (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There is a paucity of information available on the population status of several island forms. Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2003) estimated about 4,800 individuals of&#160;<em>M. f. umbrosus</em>, but nothing is known about the status following the December 2004 tsunami. The islands of Katchall and Little Nicobar were submerged during the tsunami, and it is believed to have affected the habitat of this taxon; on the other hand, Shankaran&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2005) state that these macaques were not affected seriously on Greater Nicobar Island. The disaster could have impacted their populations on these two islands due to the fruiting&#160;Pandanus&#160;being affected by the tsunami (M. Singh pers. comm). The population on Con Son (<em>M. f. conderensis</em>) likely numbers less than 1,000 individuals, and a number of other island forms probably have a similar status.<br/><br/>In spite of its wide distribution, excessive hunting and persecution of this species is cause for concern. Studies of Bonnet Macaques (a similar species) indicated steep population declines due  to persecution and commensal populations being sinks over the last few  decades.

17951229,12560,Macaca sinica,Endangered,A2cd+4cd,2020,2015-11-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Although this is a widely distributed species on Sri Lanka, the population is suspected to have declined by more than 50% in the last 40 years (approximately three generations) due to habitat loss at an equal or slightly higher rate. The species is also threatened from persecution as a pest, and minimally from the pet industry<br/></p><p>More specifically, according to government data, during the 42-year period (1956-1993) the country lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 70% if the last 22 years to the present are included. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number of macaques (Dittus 1977). Since 2003 a new threat has emerged: it involves translocating animals considered pests to unsuitable habitats where macaque survival is at risk (Dittus 2012a,b). In addition, there has been a loss of at least 15% of natural habitat in the Northern Dry Zone areas, especially since the end of the war in 2009 and further losses are expected (Mattsson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The large-sized protected areas (as well as unprotected ones) in the dry and arid zones provide suitable ecological habitat in less than 2% of their areas: only along the narrow riverine forests for this water dependent species (Dittus 1977). Therefore, macaque densities in most National Parks and other remaining tracts of the dry zone forests have been estimated to be extremely low: at 0.2–0.5/km² (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, McKay 1973, Dittus 1977). Wet zone habitats (<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>) are densely populated by humans and macaques are isolated in fragmented patches and are treated as pests (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In the montane areas,&#160;<em>M. s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;is assessed here as Critically Endangered. This endemic species is threatened also by the fact that it has no legal protection but is managed as a pest species. In human-monkey conflict situations people are at liberty to kill macaque monkeys, and some commercial air-rifle sellers advertise their products with macaques as targets. The overall empirical profile for the species justifies IUCN Endangered status. Notwithstanding, the&#160;public perception of macaque numbers countrywide is highly overblown because macaques are often lured out of the forest towards refuse and crops where they are seen easily. Garbage feeding macaque populations can grow exponentially (Dittus 2012, Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). These facts, together with macaque-human conflict (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cabral <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dittus <em>et al</em>. 2019), have misled some people to question the species’ overall threatened status, and therefore poses a political challenge for conservation policy and management.&#160;</p>","The species is found in a variety of forest types (Dittus, 1977) at all altitudes up to about 2,100 m (Corbet and Hill 1992).&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">Macaca sinica aurifrons&#160;</em>is found in lowland and midland tropical rainforest and wet zone lowland forests,&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. opisthomelas&#160;</em>in montane tropical rainforest, and&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. sinica&#160;</em>in the extensive dry evergreen forest near permanent water. The species is mainly arboreal and terrestrial and diurnal. It is frugivorous, but also consumes flowers, new leaf shoots, tubers, insects, and the occasional small vertebrate. It adapts easily to human foods (Hladik and Hladik, 1972, Dittus, 1977). Its local and wider geographic distributions are limited by the availability of free water; in the dry and arid zones this means that its ecological distribution is far less than suggested by the area of occupancy in red lest assessments (Dittus, 2013).","<p>The chief threat to this species is habitat loss owing to the encroachment of plantations, and fuel wood collection. Other threats include shooting, snaring and poisoning of the animals, as they are considered to be crop pests (Dittus 2012, Molur<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country lost 50% of its forest cover and more than 50% if the last 10 years (1994-2003) are included. Over the last 15 years the rate of decline has remained the same with increasing pressures of habitat modification, forest die back, agriculture, plantations, and settlements. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. Therefore, the species is reduced numerically minimally by 50% (Dittus 2012, Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Much of the original forested habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>&#160;in the southwest rainforest areas has been converted to agriculture, home gardens and plantations. These habitats are inimical to macaque survival because the animals are not tolerated by humans (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations during the 19th century. The populatoin of <em>Macaca s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;has been reduced by &gt;80% over the last 20 years. This trend is continuing as high elevation natural forests are being converted to agriculture (vegetable plots and dairy pasture) (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Dittus 2013, Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Wickramanayake and Gunatilleke 2002, Wijesundera 2012); the subspecies is assessed as Critically Endangered. The Mahaweli Development Scheme has destroyed much dry-zone forest habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. sinica&#160;</em>(Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003) and continues to impact dry zone forests (Mattson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Jayasuriya&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). The protracted civil war in Sri Lanka has had a negative impact on habitat and wildlife in the dry zone (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also persecuted due to increasing human-wildlife negative interactions throughout the range (Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). The declines are predicted to continue for another 2-3 decades given the increasing population impacts, development schemes, lack of political will, expanding agriculture and plantations, forest die back, tourism, linear intrusions, and general lack of habitat and wildlife promoting attitudes.<br/></p>","<p>The species is widely distributed in Sri Lanka where virtually all populations inhabiting undisturbed natural forest are in decline owed to habitat loss. The three subspecies vary in the degree of old-growth habitat remaining to support population numbers and that of the montane subspecies&#160;<em>Macaca sinica opishtomelas</em>&#160;is the most threatened. Towns, tourist and temple provides macaques access to human foods and this has developed into concentrations of conspicuous pest macaques at these sites.

The species is also predicted to decline by more than 50% over the next three generations across its entire range due to continuing hunting pressures and loss of habitat. Hunted animals are used for traditional medicines, and for national and international trade in pets and tourist photo props. Bengal Slow Lorises are also caught for meat, and their body parts are used as tourist key rings. The combined effects of forest loss of more than 30% over the last 24 years, and disappearance of the species in several locations in countries like Cambodia due to hunting, and continued threats into the future are factors determining the declines in the past, continuing and suspected declines in the future.</p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This is an arboreal, nocturnal species that inhabits tropical evergreen rainforest, semi-evergreen forest, and mixed deciduous forest. In Viet Nam it is found only in secondary forests, and on the edge of primary forests; the species also occurs in agricultural fields and plantations (V. Thanh pers. comm., Pliosongnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). It ranges from sea level (U. Streicher pers. comm.) up to 2,400 m (Choudhury 2001). In Cambodia, <em>N. bengalensis </em>has been observed in dipterocarp and evergreen forest (Mould 2013, Eam Sam Un 2014) and community forests (Eam Sam Un 2014). In India, they are found in semi-evergreen, evergreen and mixed deciduous forest (Das 2005, 2009, 2014; Pliosungnoen 2014). In Laos, the species is found often in protected evergreen forests (Evans 2000, Coudrat 2012), and have also been observed in plantation forests (Pliosungnoen unpublished data) and bamboo stands (Streicher pers. comm). It can live in heavily disturbed agricultural areas if suitable foods are available.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>The diet of the Bengal Slow Loris consists of nectar, plant bark, fruits and small invertebrates; the majority of their wild diet comprises plant exudates and this is a key staple year round (Swapna <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Das <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Nycticebus bengalensis</em> are venomous, as are other members of the slow loris genus (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>This animal's life span is about 15 years, and generation time is 7-8 years.

Streicher pers. comm).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">The major threats that this species' habitat faces include farming, timber removal, human settlement, road building, dams, power lines, fragmentations, soil loss and erosion, and deliberately set fires. It is hunted and traded for food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pet (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V. Thanh and U. Streicher pers. comm., Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). Road kills represent another threat to this species (Rhadakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is also threatened for the tourist photo prop trade across some of its range, particularly in Thailand, where 94% of individuals photographed in the photo prop trade from Patong beach were <em>N. bengalensis </em>(Osterberg and Nekaris 2015); this trade is extending into Europe, in countries such as Turkey. The species has been observed for sale in markets for traditional medicine purposes at Mong La, on the Chinese border of Myanmar (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2013), where its arms are also sold as key rings (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is also known to be sold for use in traditional medicine elsewhere (Cambodia, Viet Nam and India) (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The exploitation of the species appears to be particularly high in Cambodia with researchers reporting no <em>N. bengalensis </em>present at most sites (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The release of slow lorises confiscated from the illegal pet trade with little or no rehabilitation is a threat to all slow loris species, as is translocation from human-dominated landscapes into forests, to which individuals of the species may not be adapted (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Starr and Nekaris 2015). Lack of law enforcement further threatens slow loris species across their range (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>In India, the encounter rates vary from 0.1 to 0.77/km (Radhakrishna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Surveys have been carried out in Assam, India since 2005, with densities fluctuating over time. In 2005, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>ranged from 0.03-0.05 individuals/km (Das, 2005), in 2009 densities were found at 0.18 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2009). In 2014, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>had declined to a range of 0.06-0.20 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2015).

In 2011, a juvenile Bengal slow loris was encountered downhill from Saw Law (N 26.15396, E 98. 27053; elevation 1,541 m asl) on the way back to Chibwe (N 25.88614, E 98.12851; elevation 257 m asl). Hunters in this area also reported seeing them during shifting cultivation. A captive Bengal slow loris was recorded in Phimaw Internally Displaced Person’s camp in February - March 2013 that was reported to come from the local area. According to local people, slow lorises are rarely seen in this area and are not easy to find. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, no specific nation-wide population survey on this species has been carried out, but a 2015 survey team encountered 34 Bengal slow lorises (18-night survey) in Satchari National Park of Sylhet division. A one-night survey in Lawachara National Park revealed three individuals (S.C. Rahman, pers. comm). The species was also recorded in Rema-Kalenga&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>, 2011) and Rajkandi Reserve Forest of Sylhet area (M. Foysal, T. Khan, pers.comm). Feeroz (2013) reported <em>N. bengalensis </em>as being rare in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittagong region. All of these forests are semi- evergreen. A photography record is available from Kaptai National Park, Rangamati Hill District under Chittagong division (S.R. Rahul, pers. comm.). Beside these records, since 2010, several Bengal Slow Lorises were taken from human habitation in Jamalpur, Sherpur and Mymensingh district. These districts have some deciduous forests and are connected with Meghalaya state of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan Choudhury (2008) reports that Bengal slow loris habitat is mostly tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the foothills up to 300 m. The species has been indirectly recorded in the possession of woodcutters in four dzongkhags including Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarpang and Zemgang. From this, Choudhury inferred that they should occur in Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Wangchuk&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) wrote that lorises also occur in Chukha and Samchi districts, but did not say on what evidence. The existing records indicate that the Sankosh River is the western limit for the species in Bhutan as well as Assam.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, some researchers report the population to occur potentially in large forest tracts (R. Timmins pers. comm). Duckworth (1994) and Ratajszczak (1998), however, both reported the species as being very rare in Lao PDR, with the former reporting abundance indices of about 0.30-0.65/km at sites including: Central Laos (Phou Xang He, NakaiNam Theun, Xe Piang, Muang Hom, Nam Kading, Nam Ao, Bang Navang) and South Laos (Xe Namoy). In 2000, published data from 1994-1995 recorded <em>N. bengalensis </em>frequency as “common” in some forests (Phou Khaokhoay NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, and Bolavens Northeast PPA), whereas they were encountered “occasional” in others (Nakai Plateau) (Evans, et al., 2000, Streicher, 2014). A single record comes from Southern Laos in Xe Kaman lowlands in Dong Ampham NBCA, Attapu Province&#160; (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the populations are severely reduced and have disappeared from many forests (Fitch-Snyder and Thanh 2002; V. Thanh pers. comm). Surveys carried out in northern Viet Nam at Na Hang Nature Reserve in 2013 recorded a density of 0.09 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data). Recent surveys of N. bengalensis in Central Vietnam at Bach Ma National Park returned no animals in 30.4 km of surveys (Blair, unpublished data). A large population with a phenotype of the Cambodian forms occurs on Phu Quoc island in the Gulf of Thailand (Huaong and Blair, pers. comm). Surveys in 2014 in Phu Quoc Island recorded a density of 0.38 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the species is very rare and has only been seen west of the Mekong River in Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Kulen National Park at 22.5-25.0 animals per km2 (Starr et al., 2010). Observations of recently hunted animals were made in Preah Vihear Protection Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Tbeng (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2011). Starr <em>et al</em>. (2010) failed to detect this species in Bokor National Park and Cardamoms Protected Forest; they also did not detect it east of the Mekong (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri PF); Coudrat et al. also could not find this species east of the Mekong at the following sites: Mondulkiri (Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Pritch Wildlife Sanctuary) or Ratanakiri (Vonsei District, Virachey National Park, Seima Protection Forest, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary). Other surveyors in Cambodia have noted the presence of the species in a number of community forests (Eam Sam Un, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Bengal slow loris is thought to be widespread (W. Brockelman pers. comm.) but has never been surveyed specifically.&#160; It is known from Khao Yai National Park. Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the species is absent from many forests, and occurs at very low densities when present. In plantation forest in Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, they recorded Bengal slow lories at a density of 0.64 individuals/km (Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In China, surveys have been carried out since 2013. Bengal Slow Loris habitat is mostly primary evergreen broad-leaf forest up to 2,200 m. The population occurs in counties of western and southwestern Yunnan (Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhenkang, Cangyuan, Gengma, Yongde, Shuangjiang, Ximeng, Lancang, Menglian, Menghai, Mengla), even in secondary forests and agricultural plantations (Ni, pers. comm.). Survey in Cangyuan recorded a density of 0.33 individuals/km (Ni, unpublished data). In southern and southeastern Yunnan, Bengal slow loris is mostly distributed in scattered nature reserves as follows: Yuanjiang, Amushan, Guanyinshan, Huanglianshan, Fenshuiling, Daweishan, Laojunshan, Gulinqing, Laoshan. The populations are severely reduced and have possibly disappeared from southwest of Guangxi Province (Ni, per. comm.). Suitable habitat, also containing gibbons, can be found in many nature reserves, where the species is likely present but still to be confirmed, including Nanguanhe, Ailaoshan, Xishuangbanna, Nabanhe, Wenshan in Yuannan; and Bangliang in Guangxi.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Bangladesh, Cambodia West of the Mekong River, China (southern and western Yunnan and possibly in southwestern Guangxi), north-eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra, and Viet Nam.</p>","The species is&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">hunted and traded for (i) food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pets (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V.

Also, the number of mature individuals is not much above 2,500.","<p>The habitat and ecology of Western and Eastern Tur do not differ noticeably. Western Tur are more influenced by high precipitation and heavy snow cover. They mostly inhabit subalpine and alpine zones between 800 and 4,000 m asl. They rarely live in forests outside of the snowy season, probably because forest in the West Caucasus is composed predominantly of fir <em>Abies alba </em>and spruce <em>Picea <span style="""">spec.</span></em><span style=""""> and forms closed stands. Where pine <em>Pinus</em> sp. is more abundant, Western Tur stay more readily in forests (Kotov 1968). During the region's harsh winters, tur concentrate on sunny slopes, with 30 to 80% of the animals staying below timberline; during the summer, tur expand their distribution to slopes of different exposures (Kotov 1968). Tur make d</span><span style="""">iurnal and seasonal migrations up t</span>o 20 km long, but usually much less and mostly vertical (Kotov 1968)<br/> <br/> At high population densities, summer herd size average 11.7 animals, while in winter this rises to 20.3 individuals (Kotov, 1968). Population densities in summer may reach 13 animals/km², more than tripling in wintering areas to 44 animals/km² (Kotov 1968). The sex ratio usually favors females (Kotov 1968, Romashin, 2001). Snowy winters decrease population densities significantly (Trepet 2014). <br/> <br/> The rut lasts from mid-November until the beginning of January; birthing season takes place in May-July. Only one kid is born. One month after parturition, average proportion of kids is 13%, but yearlings only 5-9% (Kotov 1968, Romashin, 2001). Snowy winters significantly decrease juvenile proportion (Trepet 2014). Mortality and survival rates are not known but may be expected the same as in Eastern Tur <em>Capra cylindricornis</em> (Veinberg 1984, Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2001). Hence the generation length may be estimated the same – 7 years.</p>  <p>Western Tur are being preyed upon by wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> and lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em>, but snow avalanches cause most natural deaths in adult animals (Kotov 1968). Wolf population density depends upon tur population density but not <em>vice versa</em> (Trepet 2014). The leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, while formerly a major predator of <em>C. caucasica</em>, is now very rare in the Caucasus.<br/> <br/> Western Tur coexist with Caucasus chamois <em>Rupicapra r. caucasica</em>, dominating over the latter throughout the year (Kotov, 1968; Romashin, 2001). The proportions of kids in the populations are mutually negatively correlated in both species, but more markedly so in chamois (Romashin 2001). </p>  <p>The diet of <em>C. caucasica</em> contains over a hundred recorded species of plants, especially grasses. In winter, animals often browse on pine, spruce and willow. Salt licks are visited mostly in the end of spring to beginning of summer (Kotov 1968).</p>","<p>Livestock grazing and poaching are the major threats to the Western Tur, combined with the impacts of severe winters. Poaching is probably the most significant cause of the recently observed serious declines. Livestock grazing results in competition for resources, especially with domestic sheep and goats, but since the species currently exists mainly in the Caucasus Nature Reserve, competition with livestock is minimal, and poaching is reportedly almost non-existent there now (Trepet 2018). The species is also impacted by habitat loss and degradation (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Comparing old published information and photos with current data, there is an impression that hybridization zone may be expanding westwards, due to much higher numbers of the Eastern Tur, thus minimizing geographic range of Western Tur.</p>","<p>The total population estimate in the late 1980s was <em>ca</em> 12,000 animals (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997), but in recent years numbers have been declining significantly (P. Weinberg, unpubl. data). In 2001, numbers were estimated at 6,000-10,000 (Krever <em>et al</em>. 2001). If considered as inhabiting only the westernmost part of the Caucasus within Krasnodar Kray, Adygea, western Karachay-Cherkessia in Russia, Abkhasia region in Georgia, then the population is small. There were about 2,000-2,500 Tur in the Caucasus Biosphere Nature Reserve until 2015 (Romashin 2001, Trepet 2014), but latest data indicate growth to more than 3,000 in 2016-2017 (Trepet 2018). In Georgia, in the 1990s, 2,500 animals were been estimated (NACRES 1996), and in the 2000s, 1,000 animals (Kopaliani and Gurielidze 2009). However, more recent data prove just about 100 Western Tur in Georgia (Gurielidze 2018). Such absolutely different figures may have been caused by varying approach to Tur taxonomy. The total population was given at 5,000-6,000 animals by Weinberg (2004), but current estimate might be closer to 4,000-5,000, not only because of decrease but also due to different taxonomic approach (Weinberg, Akkiev and Buchukuri 2010). Thus, the apparent decline from 6,000-10,000 in 2001 to 4,000-5,000 in 2019 would be non-genuine.</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the western part of the Great Caucasus Mountains in Georgia and Russia. Its range stretches in a narrow stripe from Abago Mountain massif (43º53’N, 40º08'E) (Trepet 2014) to the Large Zelenchuk River headwaters on the northern slope (approximately 43º21’N, 41º17'E) and Bzyb River headwaters on the southern slope. Slightly westwards, already in Teberda River valley animals clearly demonstrate morphological features close to those of <em>Capra cylindricornis</em>(like faint spiraling twist of the horns), and from there to Bezengi River valley a morphologically intermediate population occurs (Weinberg, Akkiev and Buchukuri 2010). However, current genetic studies do not clarify taxonomy of Tur (Manceau<em>et al. </em>1999, Pidancier<em>et al. </em>2006, Zvychainaya 2008,). Thus, the present length of the range of typical <em>Capra caucasica</em> hardly exceeds 120 km. The distribution reaches its maximal width in Karachay-Cherkessia, near the headwaters of Laba and Large Zelenchuk Rivers - up to 30 km, and it is considerably wider on the northern slope than on the south slope due to topographic reasons. Consequently, the range of the Western Tur is the smallest one among all species of the genus <em>Capra</em>. Distribution of tur in general is the widest—up to 70 km—in Kabardino-Balkaria, where morphologically intermediate, possibly hybrid population occurs (Weinberg, Akkiev and Buchukuri 2010). Comparing old published information and photos with current data, there is an impression that the hybridization zone may be expanding westwards because <em>Capra cylindricornis</em> is much more numerous with much larger range, thus minimizing geographic range of Western Tur. So, a sort of absorbing hybridization may be occurring.",<p>This species is hunted illegally for food by local human communities.</p>,Terrestrial,"<p>This species had never been listed in Red Data Books of the USSR and Russia, and thereby was not fully protected. Hunting under licence is permitted in some areas. It is listed as Endangered (EN) in Georgian Red List (Decree 2014) and thus legally protected. This tur is protected in the Caucasus Nature Reserve (Russia), which has played a major part in its conservation (Bannikov 1977, Trepet 2014). It has been reported from Pskhu-Gumista and Ritsa Nature Reserves in Georgia (Abkhazia), but recent surveys indicate that it visits these areas (as almost the whole of the southern slope) only seasonally. The most useful conservation measure at present would be to increase the level and effectiveness of protection in existing reserves, because organization of new ones seems improbable for the time being. Monitoring should be undertaken.</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Argali are sensitive to deep snow, particularly if forage is limiting; often migrating from high mountain habitats during winter, but are present all year round at lower elevations in the Gobi desert (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2005; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2017a, 2017b). Most argali live on alpine grasslands between 3,000-5,500 m, often descending lower in winter (particularly if snow accumulates to more than a few cm). In some areas, (e.g., Gobi desert of southern Mongolia, Karaganda area of Kazakhstan), they live in lower elevation, semi-arid areas. They generally avoid forested areas (except in Kazakhstan, where they are presumed to occupy forests because of displacement from preferred habitats, Fedosenko and Blank 2005). They prefer to occupy open areas with a gentle slope; females generally occupy steeper (cliff) terrain following lambing. Argali feed on grasses, sedges, and some herbs and lichens, and they regularly drink from open springs and rivers (Wingard <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Where sympatric with blue sheep they are more likely to occur in grass-dominated communities compared to the sedge-dominated communities occupied by blue sheep. Argali are gregarious and live in groups from 2-150 individuals, with aggregations of 1,000 and more individuals reported from Tajikistan (Michel and Muratov 2010; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2010; unpublished data ANCOT). Wolves <em>Canis lupus</em> and snow leopards <em>Panthera uncia</em> are their primary natural predator, although smaller predators feed on lambs (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2009). Gestation is about 160 days, and females give birth to one offspring (twins are occasionally reported in the literature, but documentation is poor). Mothers separate from the herd to give birth and remain alone with her offspring for several days. Females are sexually mature at 2 years, while males may not sexually mature until 5 years; maximum life-span is 10-13 years (Fedosenko and Blank 2005).</p>","<p>The main threats are poaching (for meat), competition, displacement and possibly disease transmission by domestic livestock, and habitat loss. In general, argali appear to be extremely intolerant of human disturbance (Fedosenko 1999; Namgail 2004; Maroney 2006; Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2007; Harris 2007; Schaller and Kang 2008) although observations in areas without poaching and disturbance by livestock and dogs (see Young <em>et al</em>., 2011), e.g., the Kumtor Gold Mine and Sarychat Ertash Strictly Protected Area, suggest that argali can become habituated to human presence. International border fences present a barrier to movement and dispersal of argali, prevent access to optimal seasonal grazing sites and increase fragmentation and genetic isolation (Luikart <em>et al</em>. 2011; Rosen 2012; CMS 2014; Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2018). These threats appear to vary little among argali populations, even though habitats vary.<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, poaching is generally considered to be a continuing threat to argali, the presidential ban on hunting notwithstanding. <br/> <br/> In China, poaching has been considered to be a substantial threat (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1997; Schaller 1998). In the mid-1990s however, a nationwide effort to confiscate guns from pastoralists substantially reduced the weaponry available for poaching. This, together with continued efforts to publicize the national law prohibiting killing protected species, appears to have reduced poaching during the last decade or so. At the same time however, efforts to regularize and sedentarize pastoralists generally increased habitat conflicts, because pastoralists typically intensified their use of productive grasslands preferred by argali, thus displacing them (Harris 2007, 2010). Additionally, industrial development in particular mining threatens the availability and quality of argali habitat (Harris <em>et al.</em>2009, Harris 2010). <br/> <br/> Some of the strongest data suggesting interference competition from livestock as a limiting factor for argali comes from Ladakh, India, where Namgail <em>et al</em>. (2007) and Singh (2008) documented argali shifting their habitat preference toward escape terrain and away from preferred foraging areas when livestock were present. Intensifying livestock grazing may cause fragmentation of argali habitat in Ladakh and prevent recovery (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk, 2001, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> As elsewhere, livestock grazing and poaching were considered the principal limiting factors to argali in Kazakhstan by Fedosenko (1999b). FAO statistics confirm that livestock numbers are increasing in Kazakhstan and this affects the availability and quality of argali habitat. </p>  <p>There is general consensus that habitat conditions for argali improved after Kyrgyzstan’s independence in 1991, due to the collapse of the state-supported livestock sector and consequent reduction in grazing pressure in the Tian Shan and Pamirs (Farrington 2005). It is unclear whether relatively low livestock density near the Chinese border will continue. Poaching and competition with livestock are also considered threats in Kyrgyzstan (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). After independence in 1991, the number of domestic sheep herded into argali habitat declined dramatically, which likely had a beneficial effect. However, since 2000 there livestock numbers have again risen. <br/> <br/> The main threat facing argali in Mongolia is poaching for subsistence (meat) and increasingly for their horns, which are increasingly being used as substitute horn in traditional Chinese medicine (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001; Amgalanbaatar 2002b; Clark <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Also important are the impacts from local, nomadic pastoralists who displace argali, whose livestock feed on the same forage as argali, and whose dogs chase and even kill argali (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 1998, 2003, 2005; Wingard 2005; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2006; Young <em>et al</em>. 2011). More minor and localized threats include unsustainable trophy hunting (Amgalanbaatar 2002a; Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004; Wingard and Zahler 2006; Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016) and habitat loss resulting from rapidly increasing resource extraction (i.e., mining) (Reading <em>et al</em>. 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005). Subsistence poaching by miners general represents a greater threat than actual mining activities, but this may change as the number of mines continues to grow rapidly. These threats remain important due to poor or non-existence law enforcement throughout most of the range of the species in Mongolia. Very little money from trophy hunting currently supports conservation activities in Mongolia (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a; Wingard and Zahler 2006; Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016).<br/> <br/> In Pakistan, in addition to disturbance from livestock (grazing in Khunjerab remains legal; Knudsen 1999, Khan and Khan, n. d.), increased access to the area through the Karakoram Highway is believed to have increase poaching pressure (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/> <br/> Unlike in Mongolia, domestic livestock herds in the Russian Altai were reported as having declined during the 1990s (Paltsyn 2001), providing a potential opportunity for expansion of the protected area network in the Altai-Sayan area. <br/> <br/> In Tajikistan competition with livestock and harvesting of the subshrub teresken <em>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides</em> affect argali habitat. Poaching is the limiting factor in many areas except few hunting concessions, community-based game management areas and remotest regions (Michel and Muratov 2010; Michel and Rosen 2016). Projected climate change is predicted to cause shifts in the habitat available for argali (Salas <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> In Uzbekistan, poaching represents the main threat facing Severtzov’s argali, which continues to occur even within protected area (N. Beshko pers. comm.). The second major threat to Severtzov’s argali is a loss of habitat and competition with domestic livestock for forage. Finally, inbreeding and harsh climatic conditions represent threats for the very small, isolated populations in the Aktau, Tamdytau, and Malguzar Mountains (N. Beshko pers. comm.).</p>","<p>Deriving a global population size from the available data is challenging. Numbers provided in CMS (2014) suggested a total number of about 107,000 argali, but our population information suggests a substantially lower number. Available figures are of varying reliability and refer to different spatial and temporal scales. Apparent increases in numbers are likely due mainly to more intensive surveys. Area-specific reports suggest locally stable or increasing population sizes, but over large areas trends of decline.</p>  <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> In the early 1970s, Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1978) accounted for approximately 1,260 argali in the Pamirs (including both Big and Little Pamir segments), from which they estimated a total abundance of about 2,500. During their survey in autumn 2004 (primarily of the Little Pamir), Schaller and Kang (2008) tallied 624 argali (87% of which were in the Little Pamir), and speculated that the total number might be 1,000. Some of the argali tallied in the Little Pamir may periodically cross into Tajikistan, and thus possibly be counted within surveys there. Harris and Winnie (2008) estimated that they observed 120-210 individual argali in the western segment of the Big Pamir in November-December 2007. Harris et al. (2010) used DNA microsatellites extracted from fecal samples collected in 2007 for a refined population estimate in the Big Pamir (northern slopes of Wakhan Range), yielding 172 (CI= 113-132) female and 249 (CI = 50-448) males. They consider the male estimate likely biased possibly because of movements in and out of the study area. They report further 106–191 male argali (no female) directly observed in Waghjir Valley in 2007. Observations in the border areas of Tajikistan (A. Bekmurodi, pers. comm. 2009, Kh. Karimov, pers. comm 2015) suggest that seasonally several thousand argali may inhabit the near border areas in the eastern Big Pamir and in the Little Pamir.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Wang <em>et al</em>. (1997) put forward estimates of 29,000-36,000 for <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em> alone (in Tibet, Qinghai, and southeastern Xinjiang); although Wang (1998) subsequently wrote that such an estimate was probably a “significant overestimate”), with an additional 2,100-2,800 <em>O. a. darwini</em> (in Inner Mongolia), 600-700 <em>O. a. jubata</em> (in Inner Mongolia), 8,000-11,000 <em>O. a. karelini</em> (in the Tian Shan), 2,000-3,000 <em>O. a. polii</em> (in the Pamirs), and some additional <em>O. a. ammon</em> (in northern Xinjiang near the Mongolia border). This would suggest an estimate during the early 1990s of 41,700-53,500 argali in China. Later, as part of a nationwide attempt to generate numerical estimates for wildlife, Yu estimated the total number of argali in China to be between 23,298 and 31,910 (Yu Yuqun, Northwest Institute of Endangered Species, Xian, personal communication, 2004). Both of these estimates were extrapolations based on density estimates from limited areas, and neither was associated with sufficient explanation to assess their accuracy. Given the tendency for density estimates to be taken from areas known to have the densest concentrations and to use models that are usually biased high (Harris and Burnham 2001); these estimates are more likely to be biased high than low. <br/> <br/> On the Tibetan plateau, Schaller (1998) considered that “…the total number of Tibetan argalis could be as low as 7,000”. For the Tibetan Autonomous Region, Liu and Yin (1993) estimated 5,000 argali. For Gansu, in a letter to the US Fish and Wildlife Service dated May 17, 1991, Wang Zhangyun of China’s CITES Management Office suggested that there were as many as 20,000 argali in this province alone. In Qinghai, Zheng (2003) estimated a total population for Qinghai of 3,588. Earlier, Zheng and Zhu (1990) had estimated a population size of 665 (with a 95% confidence interval of 245) within selected study sites totaling approximately 600 km² of the Bu’erhanbuda Shan portion of the Kunlun Shan (based on 18 groups observed). Harris (2010) suggested that argali on the Tibetan plateau might be much less abundant than official numbers suggest and are likely declining.<br/> <br/> There are at least four written estimates of argali abundance in the Hashiha’er International Hunting Area of Gansu encompassing the northern slopes of the Danghenan Shan and the nearby Yemanan Shan in Subei County, Gansu. A provincial survey from 1990 estimated 1,452 argali (with unspecified confidence limits of 831-2,073; Gao Jun, Gansu Wildlife Protection Bureau, Lanzhou, unpublished data), an internal report of unclear origin estimated 1,525 (with confidence limits of 990—2,060; Zhao Lianghong, Subei International Hunting Area, unpublished data), Liu <em>et al</em>. (2000) cited a mean density figure of 0.482 (which is higher than either of the 2 density estimates underlying the above abundance estimates, and which equates to an abundance estimate of 4,479), and Liu (2001) estimated a population of 3,294 within Yanchiwan township (which roughly equates with the Hashiha’er hunting area boundary). All of these estimates relied on some variation of ground-based distance sampling, but in no case were sampling methods described, although Liu (2001) revealed that his density estimate was based on a sample size of 6, and the total number of animals observed was 60. A brief survey in April 1999 suggested that all these estimates were biased high (R. Harris, unpublished data). In an adjacent hunting area in Aksai county, Gansu, the 1990 provincial population estimate was 1,545 (with confidence limits of 1,127—1,963; Gao Jun, unpublished data), and the density estimate from Liu <em>et al</em>. (2000) suggested a population size of 3,879. In contrast, ~ 1-month-long surveys in both 2000 and 2003 with KIHA staff, focusing on what was believed to be the best argali habitat, documented 204-255 individual argali, and although some were no doubt missed, Harris <em>et al</em>. (2005) concluded that it was highly unlikely that the total population exceeded 500. </p>  Harris <em>et al</em>. (2009) found argali within Inner Mongolia appear to be restricted to extremely small populations (likely below 200 in total) and the future of argali there appears tenuous, most likely dependent on the ability of dispersing individuals from Mongolia to supplement existing groups or colonize new areas, although very little habitat capable of sustaining argali populations remains within Inner Mongolia.<br/> <br/> In Xinjiang, no estimates are available specifically for the Tian Shan or Altai Mountains (although estimates for the former are in the thousands, for the latter in the hundreds). In Taxkorgan County where Xinjiang shares the Pamir range with Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Schaller <em>et al</em>. (1987) documented only 87 argali and believed the population to be rather small. However, a later survey (Schaller and Kang 2008) yielded documentation of 851 argali in the Taxkorgan Nature Reserve and 1,448 argali north of it. In a separate survey during the same year (2005), Gong <em>et al</em>. (2007) surveyed selected drainages within Taxkorgan Nature Reserve, tallying 433 argali. Based on the area sampled and assumptions about suitable habitat, they extrapolated an estimate of 1,500-1,700 argali within the Reserve. No population estimates are available for argali in Inner Mongolia, but most populations appear to be isolated and small (Wang and Schaller 1996, Bu <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wang 1998). <br/> <br/> Due to the lacking of consistent trend monitoring, population trends in China are largely unknown. A population monitored periodically over 12 years in Yeniugou, in the Kunlun Mountains south of Golmud in Qinghai apparently declined (Harris and Loggers 2004). No marked difference in abundance was noted in a population monitored in Aksai, Qilian Mountains in Gansu (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2005). Surveys by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 2008-2009 found argali sparse on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and local reports of a decline in numbers, despite a lack of poaching (A. Kang, in lit. 2013, quoted in CMS 2014). We could find no more recent information for China.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Fox and Johnsingh (1997) estimated that about 200 argali remained in Ladakh. Namgail (2004) counted 127 in a ~500 km² study area in the Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary and adjacent Tsokar Basin in spring 2003. Adding unpublished recent reports of an additional 120-140 argali elsewhere in Ladakh, he concluded that there might be slightly more than 200 argali in the Ladakh. Namgail (2004) cautioned against interpreting these later numbers as an increase of the 200 estimated earlier by Fox and Johnsingh (1997). Namgail <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated 300–360 <em>O. a. hodgsoni </em>in Ladakh. Singh (2008) estimated 480–620 individuals in eight widely spaced locations in Ladakh. Argali occur in very small parts of northern Sikkim along the border between India and China, (Tibet Autonomous Region), with an estimated 177 animals (Sharma and Lachungpa 2003, Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010). In the Western Himalaya, a few individuals occasionally move into the Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh from adjacent Ladakh (Pandey 2003; Devender Chauhan, Range Officer, pers. comm. 2017, Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019) and an unknown, but possibly large population, may exist in the adjacent Tsarap Chu catchment (Abhishek Ghoshal, pers. comm, 2018).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> In the western parts of the Kazakhstan plateau (Ulytau Mountains) the argali population was extirpated in the 1950s-1960s and will most probably not recover without external intervention (Berber 2007). Fedosenko (1999b) reported that Smirnov (1965, not seen) had estimated 16,000 argali in Karaganda during the early 1960s, but that later estimates in the 1970s and 1980s had put the number at 7,000 or even 5,000. A helicopter survey in November 1991 resulted in an estimate of 9,717 Karaganda argali, but whether this was a direct count or an extrapolation was not made clear by Fedosenko (1999b). Fedosenko (1999b) quotes R. Baidavletov as assuming a total abundance of 13,500 in the Karaganda area, including 6,500 in Karaganda oblast, 2,100 in Semipalatinsk oblast, 4,300 and the remainder in other oblasts as of the early 1990s. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) guessed 8,000 to 10,000 in the northeastern distribution (<em>O. a. collium</em>), i.e., the Karaganda area, with perhaps 250 in the Kara Tau Mountains (<em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>), and an unknown number in the West Tian Shan (<em>O. a. karelini</em>). Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2003) report tallying 449 individuals within a survey area of 1,544 km² in the upper course of the Baralbas River of Karaganda and Semipalatnisk, but declined to extrapolate this figure to areas not surveyed. The developed age pyramid of the surveyed population shows that the percentage of males decreases drastically starting from the age of 3 years. Surveys after 2000 revealed a disappointing picture of argali status (A. Subbotin, pers. comm. 2008). Uncontrolled killing by those who carry firearms appeared to be common; local militia and customs officials had come to areas inhabited by argali and killed dozens with gun-machines. In the Kara-Tau Mountains, Shakula (2000) believed that the population could have been as low as 100 animals. Surveys in fall 2018 (Shaymukhambetov <em>et al</em>. 2018) yielded records of 925 argali (1.27/km² surveyed area) in Severo-Vostochnoe Game Management Area (GMA) in northern Karaganda Province, 141 (0.45/km²) in Naryn GMA in the Tarbagatay and 279 (1.09/km²) in Zaysanskoe GMA in the Saur Range (both East-Kazakhstan Region). CMS (2014) presented population estimates of argali in Kazakhstan based on annual aerial surveys (latest data from spring 2013): 163 <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>; 1,743 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, and 10,859 <em>O. a. collium</em>, and only about 10 <em>O. a. ammon</em>. Total number of argali in Kazakhstan (total for all subspecies) increased from 8,525 in 2005 to 12,775 in 2013. Official data (A. Muzbay, pers. comm. 2019) report an increase to 15,300 argali across Kazakhstan by 2017: 12, 300 <em>O. a. collium</em>. 2,500 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, 480 <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em> and 10 <em>O. a. ammon</em>. A. Berber (personal comm. 2011) confirmed an overall growth of the population of <em>O. a. collium</em> and its distribution range is expanding, but official data also suggest recoveries of <em>O. a. karelini</em> and <em>O. a. nigrimontana (</em>A. Muzbay, pers. comm. 2019<em>)</em>. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> There is little consensus regarding the abundance of argali in Kyrgyzstan. According to Fedosenko (1999b), aerial surveys conducted during winters 1990 and 1991 tallied 5,493 argali, and estimated a total population of approximately 8,000 in the early 1990s. Luschekina (1994) counted 565 individuals in the western part of the Kokshalatau range in summer 1993. Based on these counts plus older, unpublished counts, she extrapolated an estimate of 6,000 argali in northeastern Kyrgyzstan. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) reported “no more than 2,000” argali in Tian Shan (which may have included parts of Kazakhstan), and estimates of from 9,900 to 16,000 in the Pamir and Tian Shan of <em>O.a. polii</em> subspecies (which included parts of Tajikistan). Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) believed argali in both the Tian Shan and Pamirs were declining. Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2003) surveyed 190 km of transects in a similar area during spring 2002, tallying 717 argali. Largescale surveys in key argali habitats across the country carried out in December 2010 and May 2011 tallied a total of 15,311 <em>O. a. karelini</em> and <em>O. a. polii</em> in the Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas regions and 37 <em>O. a. severtzovi</em> in Batken (Davletbakov and Musaev 2012). In Kyrgyzstan, official numbers for the years 2002 – 2017 vary between 12,000 in 2007 and 21,500 in 2013, with inconsistent numbers that very well beyond feasible population fluctuations (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019). The most recent official figure was 16,669 argalis in 2017 (12,628 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, 4,013 <em>O. a. poli</em>i and 28 <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>). Abundance varies greatly. Some hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) have high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> The Mongolian Academy of Sciences has conducted a few country-wide surveys; however, the methods used do not permit accurate population estimation. Alternatively, they do provide some measure of population trends because similar methods were used. The methods involved several teams of biologists driving and hiking in areas known to at least historically contain populations of argali sheep and discussions with local people and local government officials in these areas. These surveys yielded round number estimates (lacking measures of precision) of 40,000 in 1970, 50,000 in 1975, 60,000 in 1985, and between 13,000-15,000 in 2001 (Dulamtseren 1970; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b; Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006; Mongolian Academy of Sciences, unpubl. Data). Reading <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested that no more than 20,000 argali inhabited Mongolia in 1994. The 2001 Academy of Sciences survey suggested that approximately 10,000 – 12,000 argali inhabited the Gobi Region of Mongolia (roughly corresponding to the range of <em>O. a. darwini</em>) and 3,000 – 5,000 argali inhabited the Altai Region (roughly the range of <em>O. a. ammon</em> in Mongolia). The most recent nationwide and local data were produced by a survey conducted in autumn 2009. Field teams sampled a total of 134 argali distribution units within Mongolia, which are estimated to occupy approximately 46,603 km² of the total area of 60,237 km² that was previously mapped as occupied by argali. They observed 385 groups of argali, totaling 3,373 individuals and estimated the argali population at 19,701 (95% confidence limits 9,193–43,135). However, post-survey concerns about sampling in some aimags (provinces) and estimates derived previously allowed adjustments that resulted in the best single estimate for Mongolia being 17,903 argali. Direct comparisons are difficult because previous survey reports lacked details of the areas visited, field methods, and analysis. Apparent increases or decreases in each aimag may be real, or may have been caused by differences in methods (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2010). Another survey in 2009 produced an estimate 26,155, reportedly an increase of almost 30 percent since a similar survey in 2002 (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is difficult to conclude trends from these figures given the differences in methods and coverage, but on regional distribution data, it does appear that argali continue to decline in western and central Mongolia, while populations in eastern Mongolia appear to be expanding. Argali populations in southern Mongolia appear to be relatively stable. By opinion of S. Amgalanbaatar (pers. comm. 2019) the overall population is declining slowly, despite some increases in a few populations (such as in the southeast Gobi region). Probably no more than a few thousand Altai argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em>) persist in Mongolia, while several thousand Gobi argali (the putative <em>O. a. darwini</em>) inhabit a growing range in the south and east.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Nepal</strong><br/> No estimates of the number of argali in Nepal exist; it is likely to be a small number (Shrestha <em>et al</em> 2005) , possibly in the lower 10s (K. Suryawansi, pers. comm. 2020).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Pakistan</strong><br/> Animals (<em>O. a. polii</em>) using the Khunjerab area of Pakistan may also use the Chinese side; the number of animals occurring in Pakistan remains unknown, but is likely to be small, possibly less than 100 (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997). In 2002 or 2003, Khan and Khan (n.d.) report observing 34 argali. Ali <em>et al</em>. (2017) observed a herd of 19 individuals in Karachanai Nallah, in Khunjerab National Park, in 2012. Haider <em>et al</em>. (2018) report numbers of immigrant argali in Pakistan from 1992 till 2012 varying between 31 and 168 with a declining trend the most recent figure being 41 in 2012. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> In the mid-1990s, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) estimated that between 450-700 argali occurred in the Altai Mountains of southern Russia, distributed among numerous subpopulations none of which exceed 50 animals. Paltsyn (2001) reports counts of 80-85 argali within Altaisky Zapovednik (speculating that 100-110 individuals may have existed), 150-160 in headwaters of rivers of Sailugem Ridge (south of the Zapovednik, near the Mongolian border), and 40-45 individuals along the slopes of Chikhachev’s Ridge in the Tuvan Republic. A. Subbotin (in litt.) mentioned surveys of <em>O. a. ammon</em> conducted in the Altai Republic and in the Tuva Republic in 2010, during which in total about 700 argali were recorded in the Russian Federation, with 448 in the Saylyugem Range; the overall population in Altai Republic alone was estimated at 550–600 animals (CMS 2014). In 2019 WWF Russia and WWF Mongolia jointly estimated that the Russian-Mongolian transboundary population comprised of 4,851 argali with 1,431 sheep found in Russia (1,314 in the Republic of Altai, 117 in the Republic of Tyva) and 3,420 in Mongolia, suggesting a slight increase since the last survey in 2017 (WWF 2019). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Numerous figures have been put forward for the total number of argali in Tajikistan but methodological problems make comparison and establishment of trends difficult. Luschekina (1994) reported that helicopter surveys conducted in 1991 tallied 9,415 animals, with the estimated total in Tajikistan being 9,900-10,300. Density was highest in the eastern-most section, near the border with China where a border fence limited human access. Fedosenko (1999a), based on local information in the Saluistyk River area, believed this estimate to be slightly low, asserting that population size in the early 1990s was 11,500-12,000. Based on poaching records and political events within Tajikistan at the time, Fedosenko (1999a) hypothesized a decline to about 9,500-10,000 during the mid-1990s. Fedosenko (1999a) reported tallying 4,948 argali in southeastern portions of Tajikistan in 1999 where he had tallied only 1,242 in 1995, and concluded that the population in Tajikistan had increased to 13,000-14,000. Other estimates during the 1990s by K. Kasirov (quoted by Schaller 2003) were in the 8,000-9,000 range. Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2002, 2003) surveyed 900 km of transects during late February and early March 2002 in southeastern Tajikistan, estimating that they tallied 5,951 individual argali. Extrapolations from these counts (based on poorly documented assumptions) yielded an estimate of 14,500 argali within southern and eastern study areas, and 39,900 for all of Tajikistan (their surveys evidently took place where Lushchekina (1994) and Fedosenko (1999a) had earlier postulated this highest densities in Tajikistan). Schaller and Kang (2008) tallied 1,528 argali in summer 2003 within selected census blocks totaling 1,977 km² (and in winter 2005, counted 2,200 animals within their South Alichur block in Murgab). Schaller and Kang (2008) declined to project an estimate for all of Tajikistan, but believed that the 13,000-14,000 estimated by Fedosenko (1999a) was “of the correct order of magnitude”. During a survey covering 8,170 km² in the Eastern Pamirs in December 2009 a total of 23,711 argali in 510 herds were recorded with maximum herd size of 1,100, but varying densities with some large aggregations of argali contrasting with vast empty areas of suitable habitat (Michel and Muratov 2010). A part of the survey area where about 2,200 argali had been recorded has since been transferred from Tajikistan to China (Bitabarova 2015). Valdez <em>et al.</em> (2015) reported a slight decline in numbers from 8,649, 8,392, and 7,663 observed in the southeastern Pamirs during winter surveys in 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012 with densities of 5.42, 4.91 and 4.49 argalis/km², respectively, but suggested that differences in numbers observed were probably due principally to differing dates of surveys among years. <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>may still number around a few dozen animals along the borders with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (Sharufiddinov, Rahimov, pers. comm. to S. Michel 2008; Rahimov and Amirov 2011), but in the upper Zerafshan Valley search in 2018 and 2019 did not yield any records (unpublished data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Uzbekistan</strong><br/> The Nuratau Strictly Protected Area in the Nuratau Mountains Range hosts the largest population of <em>O. a. severttzovi</em> with estimated about 1,200-2,500 animals (direct observations of 500 – 1,150 animals) during 1994 - 2018. The numbers fluctuate but appear to be overall stable, with a slightly declining trend (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019). Outside of the protected area, the Nuratau Mountains supports few argali, most of them in the western sections of Nuratau Mountain Range and very few and only irregularly in the eastern Nuratau and Koitash ranges. No population estimates are available. Probably less than 100 argali remain in the Aktau Range. In the Tamdytau Mountains in the central Kyzylkum Desert Gritsyna <em>et al</em>. (2015) confirmed the presence of argali and captured with camera traps nine individuals, including adult males, females and lambs. The number of argali in Zaamin Strictly Protected Area in the Turkestan Range at the border with Tajikistan is not known. Further a few individuals may persist in the Malguzar Range near the Zaaminsk SPA. Therefore, a total of less than 2,000 Severtzov argali persist in Uzbekistan, of which 90% occur in the Nuratau Range (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019).",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, China (Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, possibly western Sichuan, Tibet, and Xinjiang), northern India (Ladakh and Sikkim), eastern Kazakhstan, eastern Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, northern Nepal (near the Chinese border), extreme northern Pakistan, Russia (Tuvan and Altai Republics in the Altai Mountains), eastern Uzbekistan, and eastern Tajikistan (Fedosenko and Blank 2005). There are no recent records of argali occurrence in Bhutan (Tschewang Wangchuck, pers. comm. 2008). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> Argali were historically present in much of the Afghan Pamirs of the Wakhan district (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1973, Petocz <em>et al</em>. 1978), but were not known from elsewhere in Afghanistan during recent times. They currently occupy the western section of the Big Pamirs and adjacent parts of the Wakhan Range, most of the Little Pamirs, and are often found in the Waghjir Valley as well (Harris and Winnie 2008, Schaller and Kang 2008). They are also present in the eastern portion of the Big Pamir and are currently known to be transboundary with Tajikistan (Luikart <em>et al</em>. 2011). They are occasionally reported from elsewhere within the upper Wakhan Corridor. These animals are considered to be <em>O. a. polii</em>.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Argali are distributed in most mountain ranges of Xinjiang (Yu <em>et al</em>. 1999), including the Altai Shan, Arjin Shan, Kara-Kunlun Shan, Pamirs, and Tian Shan and associated ranges. Some authorities consider all these argali except those in the Pamirs to be <em>O. a. karelini</em>; others sub-divide these into other subspecies. Within the ranges of the Tibetan Plateau, argali are distributed discontinuously and irregularly (Liu and Yin 1993; Schaller 1998; Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007; Harris 2007). Although present in ranges from the Himalaya to the Qilian Shan in Gansu, argali on the Tibetan Plateau appear to be rare where temperatures are exceedingly low, winter snows deep, and/or precipitation amounts too low to support grass (Harris 2007). However, relatively healthy populations occur in the Qilian and Kunlun Mountains of Gansu and Qinghai (although from written accounts, argali are rare in the drier, western portions of the Kunlun Shan (Feng 1990; G. Schaller, unpublished data 2001)). Chinese sources report the species as present in extreme western Sichuan (Wang 2002) but recent documentation of this is weak. Most authors consider argali on the Tibetan Plateau (including the Qilian Shan in Gansu) <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>, although some Chinese authors consider <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em> limited to southern Tibet, and consider argali north of that to be <em>O. a. dalailamae</em>. Argali are patchily distributed in Inner Mongolia (Bu <em>et al</em>. 1998), but Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) found that argali have been lost from at least two areas considered to contain remnant populations during the 1990s by Wang and Schaller (1996): the Helan Shan and the Lang Shan mountain ranges. Disturbance and habitat degradation in a 3rd area, the Mazong Shan range, has likely caused the disappearance of argali there as well; small numbers of argali persist in the Yabrai (Yubulai) Shan range, the Hada Shan area and the Erenuo’ersumu region of Sunitezuo Banner. They are historically known from parts of Shaanxi and Ningxia Provinces (in the Helan Shan, which forms Ningxia’s western border with Inner Mongolia), but recent records suggest that they no longer occur in either of these provinces (Liu Zhensheng, Gong Minghao pers. comm., 2008). These animals are variously described as <em>O. a. darwini</em> or <em>O. a. jubata</em>. Harris <em>et al</em>. (2009) believe that <em>O. a. jubata</em>, as a subspecies with unique adaptations, has become extirpated and they did not know of any credible reports of argali from south of the Yellow River within recent historical times. Argali have long been extirpated from the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Within India, argali are restricted to the eastern plateau of Ladakh and Hemis National Park in Central Ladakh. There are occasional reports of one-two individuals moving into the neighboring area in Spiti (Himachal Pradesh) (Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019), and, separately, in northern Sikkim adjacent to Tibet (Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010). Indian biologists consider these animals <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>. In Ladakh potential argali habitat was estimated at ca. 11,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Chundawat and Qureshi 1999), however much of it remained unoccupied (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk 2001). Key sites with argali in Ladakh included the Tso Kar basin, near Chumur, Kharnak, Phobrang and in the upper Indus Valley (near Skagzung), with very small populations scattered elsewhere (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk 2001, Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2009). A few individuals are known to occasionally visit the Kibber area of Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, while relatively large populations are also likely in the Tsarap Chu region of Himachal (Abhishek Ghoshal, pers. comm, 2019). The Tso Lhamo plateau is a relatively small area in the northern part of Sikkim but harbours a fairly large population of argali (Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> In Kazakhstan, argali (usually considered <em>O.a. collium</em>) are present in the central Kazakhstan Low Hills (<em>Melkosopochnik</em>) and in the Tarbagatay and Saur in the northeastern part of the country at the border with China. Wang (1998) listed the argali on the Chinese side of the border adjacent to the range of <em>O. a collium</em> in Kazakhstan as <em>O. a. karelini</em>. Small populations are also present in the Kara-Tau Mountains (<em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>, although Shakula (2000) raised doubts about the validity of this subspecies), and (<em>O. a. karelini</em>) in the ranges of the western (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and northern Tian Shan (CMS 2014). Some experts believe <em>O. severtzovi</em> has been extirpated from Kazakhstan (N. Beshko, pers. comm.). Ishunin (1970) wrote that the subspecies historically inhabited the Beltau Mountains and eastern portions of the Aktau range. But the location of the Beltau makes such occurrence unlikely, while all mountain ranges with the name “Aktau” within the potential range area are currently entirely in Uzbekistan. In the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the borders between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were modified and range area and available habitat suggest that Severtzov argali never occurred on the territories nowadays belonging to Kazakhstan, but possibly in areas transferred to Uzbekistan.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> In Kyrgyzstan, argali are present in the southeastern and eastern quarter of the country toward the Chinese border from Kazakhstan in the north to Tajikistan in the south, as well as along portions of the western Tian Shan toward the Uzbek border (Fedosenko and Blank 2005) and the northern Tien Shan along the border with Kazakhstan. Animals in southern and southeastern Kyrgyzstan are usually considered <em>O. a. polii</em>; some authorities consider those in northern Kyrgyzstan <em>O. a. karelini</em>, but geographic and morphological separation remains unclear, with often the Naryn River taken as boundary between the range areas of the subspecies. Kashkarov (2010) suggested that the Fergana Range may divide the two subspecies. Davletbakov (pers. comm. 2014) suggests that the Alay Valley in the south of Kyrgyzstan is the most substantial natural barrier limiting connectivity between argali populations and that argali north of the Alay Valley more likely belong to <em>O. a. karelini. </em>In the Southwest of the country, on the northern slope of the Turkestan Range of the Pamir Alay System, in Batken Region, argali skulls have been collected in 2007 and 2013 (collector A. N. Ostashchenko) which resemble <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>. In May 2011 Severtzov Argali have been observed in Batken region (Davletbakov and Musaev 2012).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> Argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em> and <em>O. a. darwini</em>) are distributed widely, but patchily across a large portion of Mongolia. Historically, argali occurred in disjunct populations across all, but eastern Mongolia, in areas with rolling hills, mountains, rocky outcrops, canyons, and plateaus (Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, 2003; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). Argali appeared to be expanding their distribution in eastern Mongolia, but contracting and becoming even more fragmented in western Mongolia (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Large areas formerly occupied by argali in western Mongolia now lack the species. The species’ current distribution includes portions of the Altai, Trans-Alai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, Khentie, and Khovsgol Mountain ranges, as well as isolated areas in the Gobi Desert (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). More specifically, isolated populations exist in the mountains of the Mongolian Altai and Gobi Altai Mountains, primarily the western and southern Khangai Mountains, near the source of the Arsain River in the Khovsgol Mountains, and the southernmost Khentii Mountains. Other populations persist patchily in the Dzungarian Gobi, Great Gobi, Trans-Altai Gobi, Alashan Gobi, Middle Gobi, and eastern Gobi (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1970; Sokolov and Orlov 1980; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2001; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b; Fedosenko and Blank 2005; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006)).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Nepal</strong><br/> Argali (usually considered <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>) are known from the Damodar Kunda area of Mustang District, bordering Tibet (Shrestha <em>et al</em>. 2005). They may also persist in the Dolpo region, north of the Dhualagiri Range (Wegge and Oli 1997). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Pakistan</strong><br/> Argali in Pakistan (considered <em>O. a. polii</em>) are known only from Khunjerab National Park (KNP) and environs, including the Khunerab, Kilik and Mintaka passes with China (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997, Haider<em> et al. </em>2018, Khan and Khan n.d.). In Pakistan, argali now occurs only in one small watershed, in Khunjerab National Park, bordering China, which animals visit sporadically during summer (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2017). The visitation showed drastic decline over 20 years, possibly due to fencing at the Sino-Pakistan border and dietary competition with wild herbivores (Haider <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is unknown whether argali also use the mountains separating these areas from Afghanistan’s Little Pamir to the northwest. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> Argali (considered <em>O. a. ammon</em>) were formerly found in Zabaikal, Kuray, and the South-Chuya ranges and the Ukok plateau (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). More recently, they are known only from Tuva and Altai Republics (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997; Paltsyn 2001; Maroney 2004; Paltsyn <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Argali (<em>O. a. polii)</em> are present through most of the eastern third of Tajikistan (Lushchekina 1994, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997, Schaller and Kang 2008, Michel and Muratov 2010), from the border with Xinjiang, China, in the south along the border with Afghanistan west to Langar, in the center west to Sarez Lake, and along the border with Kyrgyzstan west to Altyn Mazar. In the northwest of the country, <a name=""move35410035"">Severtzov argali <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>have been documented by skulls and reports from local people in 2011 and by direct observations in 2014 (data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project) </a>on the southern slopes of western Turkestan Range near the border with Uzbekistan and in the upper Zerafshan Valley in both, Turkestan and Zerafshan ranges. <a name=""move354100351"">Severtzov argali <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>have been documented by skulls and reports from local people in 2011 and by direct observations in 2014 (data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project). </a>In the western Turkestan Range in fall 2015 an argali ram was captured in fall 2018 (Michel, pers. comm. by Zerafshan National Park ranger 2018) and a hunting outfitter advertised in social media an alleged Severtzov argali killed from Tajikistan in February 2015. Searches in 2018 and 2019 in the upper Zerafshan Valley did not yield any records and argalis are possibly extirpated there now (unpublished data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project).<br/> <br/><u> Uzbekistan</u><br/> <em>O. ammon severtzovi</em> was previously distributed over a wide area of Uzbekistan from the northeastern part of the Pamiro-Alaya mountain range thoughout the low mountains of the Kyzylkum Desert. Historically, it occupied the mountains of Nuratau, Aktau, Koytash, Malguzar and Turkenstan Range as well as Pistalitau, Tamdytau, Bukantua, Kuldjuktau, and other low ranges in the Kyzylkum Desert (Ishunin 1970; N. Beshko, pers. comm.). Today, the majority of animals are restricted to the Nuratau Range, primarily within the Nuratau Strictly Protected Area and a small population in the western part of this mountain range (N. Beshko pers. comm. 2019). Very small populations persist (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019) in the Turkestan, western Aktau, Tamdytau (confirmed by Grytsina <em>et al</em>. 2015), and possibly Malguzar ranges, but not any more permanently in the Koytash Mountains. Previously, <em>O. a. karelini</em> also occurred in the western Tien Shan in Uzbekistan, but no records are known for the last several decades (S. Zagrebin, pers. comm. 2018). </p>",,Terrestrial,"Argali are included on Appendix II of CITES (since 2019 each subspecies as a separate species <em>O. ammon</em>, <em>O. collium</em>, <em>O. darwini</em>, <em>O. jubata</em>, <em>O. karelini</em>, <em>O. polii</em> and <em>O. severtzovi</em>), except the subspecies <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em> and <em>O. a. hodgsonii</em>, which are included on Appendix I as the species <em>O. hodgsoni</em> and <em>O. nigrimontana</em>. The United States Endangered Species Act lists argali as endangered, except in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, where they are listed as threatened. (Threatened classification allows for importation of trophies from legally taken argali in those countries under specifically-authorized permits from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Permits for importation of trophies are generally not authorized for taxa listed as Endangered).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> A trophy hunting program for argali in the Big Pamir operated from ~ 1966-1978, but was discontinued following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and to date, has not been re-established. Under this program, livestock grazing in high elevation habitats favoured by argali during summer was effectively prohibited, and poaching by local pastoralists reduced. However, domestic livestock grazing was concentrated on argali winter ranges, with the result that the overall effect on argali habitat of the hunting program was unclear (Petocz <em>et al</em>. 1978). All hunting in Afghanistan was banned by order of President in 2006. In addition, argali is specifically listed as a protected species under Article 47 of the Environment Law of 2007. There do not, however, appear to be serious effort so to enforce the ban. In 2009, argali were officially-listed as a Protected Species in Afghanistan, strictly prohibiting all hunting and trading of this species within the country. The distribution of argali in Afghanistan is entirely within the Wakhan National Park, established in 2014. The national park allows for the continuation of pastoral land use.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Argali are classified as a Category II “key species” under the Chinese National Wildlife Law of 1988. As such, permits to take argali must be obtained from province-level authorities. In practice, only the trophy hunting programs have procured permits to take argali under this legislation (Harris 2007). <br/> <br/> Argali occur in a number of Chinese nature reserves. In Xinjiang, they occur in at least six nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Arjin Shan, Kalamaili, Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), West Tian Shan, Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). On the Tibetan Plateau, argali occur in the 247,120 km² Qiangtang Reserve in Tibet and the 83,000 km² Kekexili Reserve in Qinghai, as well as in scattered populations within the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve in Qinghai (Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Gansu, argali occur in Yanchiwan Nature Reserve, and may occur in the Qilian Nature Reserve. Nature reserve designation in China does not necessarily preclude habitat conflicts, as grazing, mining, and other activities often take place.<br/> <br/> A number of trophy hunting areas have been established with argali as the focal species. Hunting areas in Xinjiang include Baicheng, Bu’erjin, Fuyun, Hami, Hejing, Qiemo, Tacheng, Tashiku’ergan, and Tulufan counties; in Gansu in Aksai and Subei counties (Subei’s consisted of two distinct areas, the Hashiha’er area in the Qilian Mountains and the Mazong Shan area in the Gobi Desert abutting Mongolia). In addition, two hunting areas in Qinghai Province, focusing primarily on blue sheep, have argali populations: Dulan (within separate townships, Balong and Gouli) and Maduo counties. One hunting area in Inner Mongolia (Yabulei) contains argali. Hunting areas in China have generally succeeded in reducing poaching and in generating some local enthusiasm for argali, but have not yet succeeded in treating habitat conflicts (Harris and Pletscher 2002; Harris 2007). Since 2006, China has suspended argali trophy hunting. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Argali are listed under Schedule I (highest protection) of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) of the Government of India (Fox and Johnsingh 1997). Poaching appears to have declined in recent years (Namgail 2004), but has evidently not been accompanied by an increase in argali. Little seems to have been done to address the likely deleterious effects of displacement increasing numbers of livestock on argali in Ladakh. Argali are rare but present in Khangchengzonga National Park in Sikkim and the Tso Lhamo plateau, where there is some threat from yaks and other livestock (Sharma and Lachungpa 2003). Bhatnagar and Wangchuk (2001) felt that even though most of the argali range in Ladakh is protected under the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary (ca. 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and part of the Hemis National Park (ca. 4,000km<sup>2</sup>), the small and fragmented populations may have poor chances of recovery in a scenario where livestock pressure persists. Recent surveys, however, point to recovery of argali in small pockets of eastern Ladakh that may be due to locally declining pastoral use by the nomads opting for alternative livelihoods (M. Khanyari, pers. comm, 2020). A positive development for all mountain areas in India is the implementation of a national landscape-level, participatory strategy called the Project Snow Leopard, which is bringing in better planning, training and funds for conservation of species in both protected and unprotected areas of the Himalaya.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> The species is listed in the Red Book and thereby legally protected from any take. Hunting permits are issued only by particular governmental decree following a special procedure, but there have been no legal hunts since 2003. Fedosenko (1999b) considered that some of the hunting concessions in Karaganda Oblast protected argali well. Between 1990 and 2000, 75 argali rams were shot in the Karaganda area, and the approximately $900,000 earned was used for scientific studies, according to Fedosenko (1999b). However, Fedosenko (1999b) also believed that trophy hunting was having deleterious effects on breeding behavior and resultant productivity of females, and recommended a reduction in the yearly offtake quota. Currently the lack of hunting options for argali is a disincentive to their protection and the conservation of their habitats (Shaymukhambetov <em>et al</em>. 2018). Trends in habitat conflicts with domestic livestock in Kazakhstan have not been well documented.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> Argali is listed in the Red Book of the Kyrgyz Republic and thus legally protected. Only a limited number of permits are issued annually to private hunting concessions (Michel and Rosen 2016). The Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area is the habitat of an argali population shared with adjacent hunting concessions.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> Argali sheep are protected as “Rare” under the 2001 revision (Mongolian Government Act No. 264) of the 2000 Mongolian Law on Animals (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). General hunting of argali has been prohibited since 1953, and is the species is further protected as “Rare” under the 1995 Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). Argali are included in Appendix II of CITES (UNEP-WCMC, 2006), with an export quota of 80 hunting trophies with horns and 44 skins and horns in 2005. Altai argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em>) were listed as Rare” in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books, and the species was upgraded to “Endangered” in Mongolia in the most recent nationwide assessment (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Approximately 14% of the species’ range in Mongolia occurs within federal protected areas, including Altai Taivan Bogd National Conservation Park (NCP), Gobi Gurvan Saikhan NCP, Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area (SPA) sections A and B, Ikh Nart NR, Khokh Serkh SPA, Khoredal Saridag SPA, Khustai Nuruu NCP, Myangan Ugalzat National Conservation Park, Siilkhem SPA, Tsagaan Shuvuut SPA, Tsambagarav SPA, and Turgen Uul SPA (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Small populations likely occur in other federal and provincial (aimag) or county (soum) protected areas as well.<br/> <br/> Although protected from general hunting, trophy hunters can purchase licenses. Under the Mongolian Hunting Fee Law of 1995, revenue generated from argali trophy hunting is divided among the federal government’s general funds (70%), the local province (20%), and the hunting organization (10%); specifically, US$ 18,000 for <em>O. a. ammon</em> trophies and US$ 9,000 for <em>O. a. darwini</em> trophies is allocated to local and federal governments (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). Ostensibly this money should benefit local people, government agencies, and help implement important conservation actions for argali and the ecosystems they inhabit, but unfortunately, little of this money makes it back to local people or to the conservation of the species (Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Indeed, because local governments generally receive no additional revenue from trophy hunting (the federal government simply reduces payments to local governments that receive trophy hunting permits), many local governments are actively establishing protected areas to prevent future hunting (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Recent reforms to Mongolian trophy hunting practices have led to proposals for community-based wildlife management programmes (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Initial efforts by WWF-Mongolia, the Argali Wildlife Research Center, Denver Zoological Foundation, and local governments stalled; however, after initiation of a Global Environment Facility Project in the region and no progress has been made in recent years. <br/> <br/> WWF and the Ministry of Nature and Environment organised a workshop on ‘Conservation of Argali in Mongolia’ in 2000 that resulted in a Argali Conservation Management Plan in 2002. However, this plan has not yet been adopted by the government and is not being implemented.<br/> <br/> Mongolia’s Argali Wildlife Research Centre, Denver Zoological Foundation, and Mongolian Academy of Sciences cooperate on a number of conservation and research projects, including an interdisciplinary research and conservation project in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve, Dornogobi Aimag in cooperation with the Dalanjargal Soum Administration. That work, begun in the late 1990s, has resulted in several publications (e.g., Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, 2003; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2003, 2005, 2009; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b, 2006, 2012; Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. 2004; Wingard 2005; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2010; Wingard <em>et al</em>. 2011a, 2011b; Bragin <em>et al</em>. 2017; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2017a, 2017b; Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2019), development of ecotourism to support conservation, a broad conservation education program, and active conservation management of the reserve by the Dalanjargal Soum Administration. <br/> <br/> Additional conservation measures are desperately required in Mongolia. Clark <em>et al</em>. (2006) outlined the following:<br/> <br/> • Implement the recommendations outlined in the Argali Conservation Management Plan, update the plan regularly and monitor its implementation, in particular in all hunting areas.<br/> • Improve enforcement of existing legislation that would help conserve argali. <br/> • Enhance conservation management in protected areas where argali are found at high population densities, and increase the capacity of protected areas personnel and other environmental law enforcement officers.<br/> • Work to improve the livelihoods of local communities in areas where argali are protected by local initiatives and re-initiate community-based approaches to argali conservation (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a).<br/> • Develop public education programmes to raise awareness of the status of and threats to the species. <br/> • Continue ecological research, monitor population trends, and study the impacts of threats, including work in the Altai and Khangai Mountains to complement research occurring in the Gobi Desert.<br/> • Implement the recommendations from the Mongolian Wildlife Trade Workshop as outlined in Wingard and Zahler (2006).<br/><br/> Major revisions to argali trophy hunting practices in Mongolia as outlined in Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. (2002a) and Reading and Amgalanbaatar (2016) could generate substantial revenue for conservation and ensure that local people benefit, greatly benefitting argali conservation. However, the barriers to changing the way trophy hunting is managed and implemented in Mongolia are formidable.  <br/> Pakistan<br/> Working with local people in the Khunjerab area toward mutually agreeable conservation solutions has been a contentious issue for many years. Successful resolution of competing claims with concerns for the interests of argali will ultimately be beneficial for conservation.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> Argali are listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, and hunting is legally banned; it is unclear how effective this legal protection is. Argali occur in the Altaisky Zapovednik, but most argali in the Russian Federation are outside of protected areas. Both Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) and Paltsyn (2001) suggested expanding the area under protected area status in the area. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested that the eastern portion of Sailguem Ridge near the Mongolian border could be a possible new protected area, as well as in the upper reaches of the Chagan-Burgazy River. Paltsyn (2001) noted that WWF has developed a long-term program to promote sustainable development in the Altai-Sayan region, which could have benefits for argali.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Argali occur in Pamir National Park (26,000 km²), and the Zorkul Zapovednik (870 km²), although neither protected area is fully functional (Schaller and Kang 2008). Argali have generally benefited from the substantial reduction in domestic livestock grazing in the high-elevation Pamirs following Tajikistan’s independence in 1991 (Fedosenko 1999a). Trophy hunting began in 1987, the same year that local hunting was prohibited (Fedosenko 1999b). Argali are legally protected and quotas for trophy hunts are issued by the Government, numbering 40-80/year (Schaller and Kang 2008, Michel and Rosen, 2016). There are reports that additional animals are sometimes sold beyond the official quotas. However, poaching, by pastoralists, military, and border guards have been major threats – in part due to the civil war of the mid 1990s – and continue to be in less extent. Protection from excessive human mortality and human disturbance appears to be well controlled by hunting concessions in the southeastern corner, somewhat less so in other portions of argali range (Schaller 2003). Trophy hunts represent a substantial source of revenue that could be used for argali conservation; this appears to be occurring in some hunting concessions within Tajikistan, but not in others (Schaller 2003, Michel and Rosen 2016). Since 2013 a community-based group developed game management area in the northern part of Alichur Pamir; revenues from hunting, tourism and conservation grants were used to prevent poaching and reduce livestock competition, resulting in an increase of argali numbers in this area. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Uzbekistan</strong><br/> Severtzov’s argali are protected with the Nuratau Strictly Protected Area and a few individuals possibly survive in the Zaamin Strictly Protected Area, which however due to its location in the border zone had been of limited effectiveness since the 1990s. The species is included in the Red Book of Uzbekistan and protected from general hunting, although limited trophy hunting is permitted and occurs irregularly with up to 5 permits per year. Unfortunately, little law enforcement to prevent poaching occurs outside of the protected areas. Support for anti-poaching and improvement of pasture use are crucial.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Group sizes usually range from 5 to 50 for males and from 5 to 100 for ‘nursery’ groups of females, lambs and young males. Bighorn Sheep&#160;require foraging areas near steep or rocky terrain that they use to escape predators.&#160; Water can be a limiting resource in desert environments.<br/> <br/> Sheep mostly eat grass, but also consume forbs and browse – diet varies widely over the large geographical range of the species. Females gestate for 175 days, and give birth to a single offspring per pregnancy. Females can first conceive at 18 months of age and males are rarely successful at obtaining paternities before about 3 years of age. Very few females live more than 15 years and very few males survive past 12 years.<br/>Most populations have separate winter and summer ranges, and many have other types of seasonal ranges.&#160; Distance between seasonal ranges can be up to 40 km. Males range widely prospecting for estrous females before and during the rut, up to 60 km.<br/><br/>The sheep are very gregarious; adult males form separate groups from nursery herds that include females, young and males aged 1-2 years.&#160; Group size depends partly on population size and can range from 5 to 100 sheep.","<p>Epizootics have occurred periodically, especially in Rocky Mountain bighorn, and together with over-harvesting and competition from livestock at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, reduced numbers significantly. Most populations recovered with the aid of wildlife management and conservation efforts, but pneumonia and mange epizootics still occur today, particularly in populations that come into contact with domestic sheep and goats. Poaching of large trophy males is a problem in some areas, including within national parks, but not at a level that threatens population status. <br/> <br/> In the USA as well as Mexico, small (&lt; 100) numbers in many herds, and pathogens from domestic sheep are major threats (Cassirer <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160; Additional threats in Mexico include habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss resulting from competition with domestic livestock and exotics, and poaching.</p>","<p>The total population of Bighorn Sheep&#160;in Canada and the USA is estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 70,000 individuals (Larkins 2010). Most populations are either increasing or stable, but drastic local declines continue to occur following pneumonia epizootics (Cassirer <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> Consistent systematic surveys of wild sheep throughout northern Mexico have not been conducted and thus, only rough population estimates are available. The total population estimate of Bighorn Sheep&#160;in Mexico currently ranges between an estimated 12,655 (Valdez and Ortega-Santos 2019) and 14,000 (based on data provided by the Wild Sheep Foundation’s Mexico Council), with numbers increasing in many areas. <br/></p>Assuming that 60% of animals are aged 2 years or older, there are at least 49,000 mature Bighorn Sheep.",Stable,"<p>Bighorn Sheep range widely in western Canada, western United States of America (USA), and northern Mexico. In Canada, Bighorn Sheep&#160;are distributed throughout the Rocky Mountains in Alberta and British Columbia, south from the Peace River to the Canada-USA border. Two small populations also have been introduced to central British Columbia outside their normal distribution. Populations of the “interior” ecotype, are scattered through central British Columbia. Populations around Kamloops and Granby have been reintroduced, mostly into historically occupied habitat.<br/> <br/> In the USA, Bighorn Sheep&#160;are widely distributed from Montana and Idaho south to Colorado and New Mexico. &#160;To the south, “desert” bighorn (traditionally <em>O. c. nelsoni</em>, <em>O. c. cremnobates</em>, and <em>O. c. mexicana</em>) inhabit southern portions of California, Nevada, Utah and New Mexico, much of Arizona, and west Texas. To the west, bighorn occur in scattered populations in the Columbia plateau and Great Basin ranges of Washington, Oregon, southwest Idaho, and northern Nevada. East of the Rocky Mountains, bighorn exist in scattered herds in badlands and river-breaks in eastern Montana, North and South Dakota, northeast Wyoming, Nebraska, and outside of historic range in southeast Colorado.<br/> <br/> In Mexico, desert Bighorn Sheep&#160;were historically distributed in the northern states of Nuevo León, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, Baja California and Baja California Sur. However, extirpation of Bighorn Sheep&#160;later occurred in Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon.&#160; Through the cooperative efforts of the federal government (SEMARNAT), private landowners, and conservation organizations, desert Bighorn Sheep&#160;in Mexico have been restored to five states including: Mexican bighorn (<em>O. c. mexicana</em>) in Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Sonora; peninsular bighorn (<em>O. c. cremnobates</em>) in Baja California; and Weems’ bighorn (<em>O. c. weemsi</em>) in Baja California Sur.</p>","Sport hunting is generally well regulated and managed. In Canada, intense selective hunting has genetic consequences and has led to a small decrease in male horn size (Festa-Bianchet <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pigeon <em>et al. </em>2016).",Terrestrial,"<p>Although protected areas such as National, State and Provincial Parks provide important reservoirs of wild sheep, restoration efforts across North America have been centered on federal, state, provincial and private lands where people live, work and recreate (i.e. working landscapes).&#160; </p>  <p>In Canada, more than 4,500 Rocky Mountain bighorns are fully protected within five National Parks (Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, Waterton, Yoho). Many also receive some level of protection in provincial parks and other protected areas in Alberta and British Columbia. Outside national parks, Bighorn Sheep&#160;are covered by provincial or state wildlife acts, and most populations are hunted under license. Harvesting both adult males and adult females is permitted in some populations. Hunting quotas are determined each year, and in general regulations are strictly enforced. Management consists of regulating annual harvests, habitat improvement, annual censuses, translocation of animals, disease surveillance, implementing separation practices between domestic and wild sheep and goats, and promoting research. Between 150 and 200 male and 150 to 200 female bighorns are harvested annually in Alberta. In British Columbia, where only males are hunted: about 100 bighorns are shot each year. In much of Canada, male harvest is limited only by the availability of adult males that have reached a minimum curl size, which can lead to artificial selection against large-horned rams (Pigeon<em> et al. </em>2016).</p>  <p>In the US, Bighorn Sheep occur on public lands including National Parks, Monuments, Recreation Areas, Wildlife Refuges, lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, and on state lands such as state parks and state general land office properties.&#160; In addition, private land provides important bighorn habitat throughout the west.&#160; </p>  <p>Since 1922, 1,460 separate projects conducted by 15 state and two provincial wildlife agencies have resulted in the translocation of more than 21,500 Bighorn Sheep.&#160; This has accounted for much of the recovery of Bighorn Sheep&#160;from historic low numbers in the 1960s. While primarily adult males are taken, some states offer adult female hunting opportunities for the purpose of reducing populations. The number of Bighorn Sheep&#160;permitted to be taken each year is conservative (1-3%) and is regulated by each state. All states require that the horn of legally-taken males be plugged (horn plugs provided to every jurisdiction by the Wild Sheep Foundation) for permanent identification. This practice allows easy identification of illegally-taken animals and thus discourages poaching. <br/> <br/> Improvement of habitat for Bighorn Sheepoccurs on state, federal and private lands.&#160; Projects have been funded with combinations of federal, state, and private moneys. Natural water sources have been improved and artificial water sources created, especially in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of the Southwest. Further north, dense forest or shrub vegetation has been cleared, often by controlled burning and silvicultural practices, to provide open areas with forage for Bighorn Sheep. Management and research biologists exchange information on Bighorn Sheep&#160;in biennial &#160;meetings of the Desert Bighorn Council and&#160; the Northern Wild Sheep and Goat Council. Proceedings of these meetings are published. In addition, the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Wild Sheep Working Group&#160; (<span lang=""EN-CA""><a href=""https://www.wafwa.org/committees_groups/wild_sheep_working_group/)%20compiles"">https://www.wafwa.org/committees_groups/wild_sheep_working_group/) compiles</a> population and harvest data, &#160;coordinates actions and develops strategies for conservation, enhancement, management and research of wild sheep across jurisdictional boundaries in North America.</p>  <p>Private conservation organizations including the Wild Sheep Foundation and their 51 Chapters and Affiliates raise funds for restoration, management and research. At least 14 states auction and/or raffle one or two special bighorn hunting licenses to raise funds for these purposes. Its status within the US is Not Threatened. While much work is yet to be completed, the status of most traditional subspecies and major ecotypes of Bighorn Sheep is satisfactory because of the conservation efforts of state wildlife agencies, private landowners and non-profit conservation organizations.&#160; <br/> <br/> Conservation measures proposed for USA: 1) Additional research on pathogen transmission from domestic sheep and goats to Bighorn Sheep, 2) Developing science-based effective separation practices between the two. Bighorn should be separated from contact with domestic sheep and domestic goats in space and time to minimize pathogen transmission. 2) State and federal agencies should coordinate planning efforts to enhance the long-term persistence of the numerous bighorn herds with fewer than 100 sheep. Strategies should include increasing herd size, expanding habitat and increasing herd mobility, and enhancing habitat quality and habitat protection in areas of connectivity between small herds (Bailey 1992). A more thorough understanding of pathogens is vital to this effort, 3) Land management agencies, especially the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, should formally recognize bighorn ranges in their management plans, including areas of connectivity that facilitate movement within and between herds. and 4) establish and expand Bighorn Sheep&#160;populations in historic and biologically suitable habitat.<br/> <br/> The species in Mexico is currently listed in Appendix II of CITES. The high price ($30,000 to over $100,000) that some conservation-minded hunters are willing to pay has motivated private and communal landowners in Sonora and Baja California to begin desert sheep restoration, enhancement and management programs. Accomplishments in Mexico rival, and in many cases exceed, accomplishments in many of the States and Provinces in the USA and Canada, ultimately leading towards a future downlisting in Mexico. </p>  <p>Future conservation measures for Mexico must include: strategies for addressing habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation; approaches for mitigating the potential transfer of pathogens from domestic sheep to Bighorn Sheep&#160;(effective separation); implementation of effective law enforcement programs; expansion of Mexico university wildlife conservation programs; and development and implementation of public wildlife education programs.&#160; </p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Their suitable habitat contains hills, undulating terrain and gentle slopes but also cliffs. Mouflon may also live and forage on crop fields. The ecology of the species is widely unknown but Mouflon are gregarious. Herds are smaller and often sexually segregated during spring and summer. They are sexually dimorphic, non-territorial and promiscuous. Main predators are Leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) and Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Feral Dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) and in much less extent Eurasian Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>).</p>","<p>Overall, this species is threatened mainly by poaching and competition with livestock (Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. 2019). Specific threats to particular subspecies are:<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em></strong><br/>In the southern Caucasus, in Armenia, Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran, Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. (2019) found that Mouflon were affected by domestic sheep through forage competition and displacement, including through disturbance by herders and dogs, which may be more detrimental for Mouflon than forage competition. Disease transmitted by livestock could also be a threat. In 2014-2016, 30 Mouflon in Haftad Golleh Protected Area, Iran suffered losses due to Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (Marashi <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>In Iraq, the biggest and perhaps most noticeable threat to the Mouflon population is poaching for their meat. Since there is no clear historical evidence, it is therefore difficult to know what other threats led to their decline. Maybe many years of war and instability that the region went through has facilitated heavy poaching as a replacement for livestock meat, which the local people could not afford during the sanction and the economic recession of the 1980s (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020). After 2003, most of the villagers went back to their villages, which had been destroyed during the regime of Saddam Hussain. There was an economical blooming in the region for a while, which led to the construction of new roads. These roads eased the accessibility for poachers. This is one of the major factors, which caused the decline of many species in the region. Habitat is destroyed by livestock grazing and urbanization (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/>In Turkey, the Bozdağ population in Central Anatolia is (almost) completely restricted to a fenced area, where the threat factors of poaching, predation and most relevant forage competition and habitat degradation by domestic sheep are excluded. Outside the fenced area these factors still limit the numbers of Mouflon (Özüt 2009). The reintroduced population in Sarıyar (northwestern Anatolia) is affected by the lack of opportunities for dispersal and seasonal migration due to Sarıyar Reservoir. Hence, it cannot spatially avoid anthropogenic disturbance, high amount of parasites, and predation pressure by wild and domestic dogs, altogether preventing an expansion of this population (Mengüllüoğlu <em>et al</em>. 2019). All captive and reintroduced wild sheep populations in central Turkey suffer from paratuberculosis and feral dog depredation. Poaching is a serious threat in eastern Turkey (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini ophion</em></strong><br/>The biggest threat affecting the Mouflon population in Cyprus is livestock intrusion into Mouflon range in the forest periphery and recently even within state forest boundaries through competition, displacement and disease transmission. Feral dogs cause substantial predation mortality and disturbance. Poaching is another important mortality factor. Road construction causes habitat fragmentation and collisions with vehicles. Reforestation of burned areas and/or planting of pine monocultures with terracing make habitat unsuitable for Mouflon. Plans for future development of solar plants and large quarries within the Mouflon range threaten large parts of its habitat (N. Kassinis, pers. comm. 2016 and presentation at the WCMU 2016 in Nicosia).</p>","<p>The global population of this species may be about 26,500 (16,000 mature individuals). The population numbers do not include suspected species hybrids between <em>Ovis gmelini </em>and <em>O. vignei</em>, occurring in Iran. Hereby we considered entire provinces if not otherwise indicated. The population trend across its range is difficult to assess. While officially reported overall numbers in the main range state, Iran, suggest stable or increasing trend (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016), local studies suggest decreases.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em></strong><br/> By the end of the 1960s, there were 1,750 in Azerbaijan and Armenia. The first population census was conducted in the 1970s  with 350-400 animals for Armenia and Nakhchivan together (Yavruyan, 1975), while Alekperov and Kuliev (1981) reported that the population in the Nakhichevan ASSR alone numbered 1,000 to 1,200 animals. In 1993, 1,200-1,500 animals were estimated for Nakhchivan (Guliyev, 2000). Then numbers declined, but the latest counts in Nakhchivan in December 2018 found the largest Mouflon numbers since beginning of surveys in 2006: 119 on Negramdagh Plateau and 90 on Darydagh Massif and foothills; the estimates are 150 and 120, respectively (Weinberg, 2019). In Armenia, during the surveys conducted during the rut, 50 animals have been found on Urts Range, and 104 on Zangezur and Bargushat Ranges; the total numbers in Armenia were estimated at no less than 250 (Weinberg and Malkhasyan, 2010). A<span lang=""EN-US""> conservative estimate might be about 400, maybe even 500 Mouflon in Zangezur Range of Armenia and Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan). Mouflon are supposedly less numerous now in the areas of Armenia and despite that more recent counts showed a larger number of animals than in the 1960s-70s, the population has declined since then, as considered by interviewed zoologists, hunters, shepherds, etc. (Weinberg, pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In Iran, recent population estimates from protected areas do not distinguish between Urial, Mouflon and hybrids. The total of figures from surveys by Department of Environment for the protected areas in the provinces Eastern Azerbaijan, Western Azerbaijan, Zanjan, Ilam, Hamedan, Kermanshah and Kurdistan, where likely <em>Ovis g. gmelini</em> only occurs, was approx. 4,200 in 2007 and around 5,200 individuals in 2016 (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, reported numbers fluctuated between the years with only approx. 2,300 reported in 2012. Valdez (2008) provided no population size for Iran. <br/><br/><span style="""">No current total population estimate is available in Iraq. Villagers interviewed in 2018 in the area south of Darbandikhan Reservoir reported seeing between 2-12 individuals in one encounter, except the local from Lime, which reported only seeing one (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020). The total population in this area might be in the range of 100-200 individuals. Numbers seen by local people further to the south, near Khanaqin are not known. Generally, Mouflon populations have declined and have disappeared in many areas in Iraq (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020). </span><br/><br/>In Turkey, there were around 50-100 Anatolian Mouflon in the Konya-Bozdağ area in 1967 (Özüt 2009). In 1989, a fenced area of 4,000 ha had been established. The size of the semi-captive population increased to 850 in 2000, while outside the fence the population size was estimated to be 50-100. By 2007, the fenced population had declined to 700 due to high mortality from paratuberculosis <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> and translocation of 200 animals (Özüt 2009). Distance sampling in early 2009 yielded an estimate of 947 (Özdirek 2009). However, the 2019 autumn inventory resulted in 530 semi-captive and 150 free-ranging individuals (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). The reintroduced population in Ankara-Sarıyar despite several re-stockings has not increased and has been oscillating around 40–80 sheep between 2005 and 2017 (Mengüllüoğlu 2019), and the 2019 inventory count was 46 individuals. Although the reintroduced population in Karaman-Karadağ has experienced a sharp decline in the first few years, it steadily increased after 2010 and the 2019 inventory indicated 100 individuals. In central Turkey, by Autumn 2019 there are in total around 600 captive or semi-captive and 320 free-ranging (including reintroduced) Mouflons (unpubl. report, Wildlife Department of Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2019). Since 2001, in spite of captive breeding, reintroduction and protection efforts total number is not increasing but decreasing; around 900 individuals are left in several separate populations, most of which are captive or semi-captive and even in captivity numbers are decreasing or stable. In addition, probably only one third of this number is breeding and except for the Bozdağ and Karadağ populations all others can easily get extinct within the next several years if not supported by new releases (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). Population numbers of Mouflon in southeastern Turkey are unknown. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini isphahanica</em><br/></strong>Numbers of wild sheep reported by the Department of Environment for the protected areas in Isfahan, Chahrmahal &amp; Bakhtiari, Lorestan and Markazi provinces fluctuated largely between 2007 (ca. 6,000) and 2016 (ca. 18,300). Large inter-annual differences suggest at least partly inconsistency in the population estimates and/or reporting. <br/></p>  <p><strong><em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em><br/></strong>Mouflon numbers in Hormozgan Province, reported by the Department of Environment increased from 138 in 2007 to 239 in 2016, but fluctuated between 112 (2008) and 370 (2009). In Hormod Protected Area in Fars Province, which encompasses the largest population of Laristan sheep, the reported estimate in 2019 was 1,040 (M. Ansari, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini ophion</em></strong><br/>The population estimate in 1999 was 3072 +/- 691 animals (Kassinis and Papageorgiou, 2000). Between the years of 2001-2003 there was an outbreak of Infectious Keratoconjuctivitis (IKC) with a Mouflon population decline of 20% in 2003 (Kassinis 2005). The 2010 fall population estimate was 2,574 +/- 599 animals (Kassinis <em>et al. </em>2012). For the years after no estimates are available, but the directly recorded numbers continuously declined from 581 in 2010 to 407 in 2015 (N. Kassinis, pers. comm. 2016 and presentation at the WCMU 2016 in Nicosia).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Mouflon are found in Armenia, southern Azerbaijan, Cyprus, northern Iraq, southern and western Iran, and eastern Turkey, with several isolated populations in central Turkey. In Iran, following Rezaei <em>et al</em>. (2010) (and unlike Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016 or Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019, which assigned the <em>Ovis </em>in all areas to either of the two species) we considered a zone of occurrence of hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em>. The exact extent of this hybrid zone and the status of certain populations of wild sheep there are uncertain. Therefore, we opted for the most conservative scenario at the province level (due to data limitations) and delineate the species boundaries accordingly. We considered the western and southern provinces (i.e., East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Zanjan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Hamedan, Markazi, Lorestan, Ilam, Khuzestan, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Bushehr) as the 'confirmed' Mouflon range as we had higher certainty about mouflon presence. Additionally, we considered western Isfahan, western Hormozgan and southern Fars in mouflon range. We did not consider other provinces with Ovis population for being more conservative as higher phenotypic diversity in wild sheep in these provinces is observable. Our tentative hybrid zone is also included in the description of the geographic range in this assessment and mapped as 'Presence Uncertain' with a note that there is a higher possibility of hybridization in this area.<br/><br/><strong>Armenian Mouflon<em style=""""> - Ovis gmelini gmelini </em>(including<em style=""""> </em>Anatolian Mouflon<em style=""""> O. g. anatolica</em>)</strong><br/>In the southern Caucasus the sheep inhabits the Zangezur range in Armenia and Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan), further in Armenia in the Aiotsdzor Ridge, Bargushat Ridge and the Urts Ridge and possibly, but currently unconfirmed, just into Kalbajar-Lachin region of Azerbaijan. This subspecies is a resident of the mountain foothills and rolling steppe of northwest and west of Iran. <em>O. g. gmelini</em> are found in western Alborz Mts., northern Zagros Mts., and specifically in Marakan Protected Area, Kiamaky Wildlife Refuge, Urmiyeh Lake National Park (Kabudan Island, where it has been introduced), Sahand Protected Area, Angouran Protected Area, and Bijar Protected Area in Iran.<br/><br/>In Iraq, populations occurred in the extreme northern region in the Zagros Mountains and along the northeastern border with Iran (Valdez 2008). Mouflon presence has been confirmed in 2018 from an area in Suleimaniyah Governorate, south of Darbandikhan Reservoir, at the border with Iran by video record and reliable local reports (H. Raza and K. Ararat, pers comm. 2020). Another local report exists from the border with Iran near Khanaqin in Diyala Governorate (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In Turkey, <em>O. gmelini gmelini</em> occurs in the southeast of the country. Its distribution is described as south of Mount Ağrı, east of Lake Van and northern and eastern territories of Hakkari and anecdotal knowledge suggests a migratory behavior between southeastern Turkey and Iran. A field study carried out at southeastern Anatolia by a group of researchers revealed that a very small number of animals were left in the previously mentioned parts of Eastern Anatolia (Weinberg and Özüt 2007). However, after 2010 no sighting record for this small population was registered; the last record was in 2005, with 10 individuals at Lesser Ağri Mountain (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). Further to the west Anatolian mouflon <em>O. g. gmelini [anatolica]</em> exist in four small areas, one in Bozdağ east of Konya in central Anatolia, the second one further south in Karaman-Karadağ, a third one in Aksaray-Ekecik and a fourth one in northwestern Anatolia, in <span class=""fontstyle01"">Ankara-Sarıyar between Ankara and Eskişehir. In the past, small and isolated populations were spread to Nallıhan and Polatlı in Ankara, Sivrihisar-Eskişehir, Emirdağı-Afyon, and Ereğli, Karapınar, Karadağ and Bozdağ in Konya. All these populations except the one in Konya-Bozdağ vanished by mid-1960s. The majority of the Bozdağ population is under semi-wild conditions in a 4,000 ha enclosure. Reintroductions occurred during 2004-2005 in Karaman-Karadağ and Ankara-Sarıyar (Özüt 2009), and in 2016 in Aksaray-Ekecik (unpubl. report, Wildlife Department of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Isfahan Mouflon<em><em style=""""> - </em>Ovis gmelini isphahanica</em></strong><br/>The subspecies is restricted to east-central Iran in areas such as Ghamishlou National Park, Mouteh Protected Area, Haftad Gholleh Protected Area, Oshtorankouh Protected Area, and Tang Sayyad National Park.<br/><br/><strong>Laristan Mouflon<em><em style=""""> - </em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em></strong><br/>This subspecies is a resident of southern Iran. The Laristan sheep is found in Hormod Protected Area and Keshar Protected Area, other populations, e.g., in Fars, might be at least partly hybrids with <em>Ovis vignei</em>. There is much uncertainty about the extent of the species and subspecies of wild sheep in Iran and further data and analysis are required for determining the taxonomic status.<br/><br/><strong>Cyprus Mouflon -<em> Ovis gmelini ophion</em><br/></strong>The Cyprus Mouflon is restricted to the 620 km² Pafos Forest in Cyprus (Hadjisterkotis 2001).<br/><br/><strong><em>Hybrid populations</em><br/></strong>Alborz Red Sheep - <em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em> x <em>Ovis vignei arkal/cycloceros</em> (Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1978) occurs in north-central Iran in the Alborz Mountains in Tehran and Alborz provinces (Varjin Protected Area, Central Alborz Protected Area, Khojir National Park, Sorkheh Hesar National Park), east to the Parvar Protected Area and south into the Kavir National Park. The exact western, eastern and southern limits of its distribution are undetermined, but generally sheep in central Alborz Mountains are considered as belonging to this hybrid form.<br/><br/>The Kerman Sheep occurring east of 55°E in the Khabr National Park and Baft mountains in Kerman Province has been suggested to be a hybrid population (<em>Ovis vignei cycloceros </em>[<em>blanfordti</em>] x <em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em>) (Valdez 2008).<br/><br/>Hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em> may occur also in other areas of Iran, including the provinces in central and northern Fars, eastern Hormozgan, eastern Isfahan, Qom, eastern Semnan, and Yazd.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<em>Ovis gmelini</em> is listed on CITES Appendix I (Only the population of Cyprus; no other population is included in the Appendices). <em>Ovis g. ophion</em> is listed in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive.<br/><br/>The Mouflon is legally protected in Armenia since 1936 and became protected in the Soviet Union by listing in Category I of the USSR Red Data Book (Borodin, 1984). In Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Mouflon is nowadays a protected species. A ban on hunting in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan, has let to recovery of Mouflon population in this area (P. Fatullaev, pers. comm. 2019). Mouflon is found in both sides of Zangezur Ridge in Zangezur National Park and Ordubad Sanctuary (Nakhichevan, Azerbaijan) and Arevik National Park, Zangezur State Sanctuary and community-governed Arpa Protected Landscape (Armenia). Bleyhl et al. (2019) suggest for the southern Caucausus that conservation planning should consider competition with livestock both reactively (lessening livestock pressure in suitable ungulate habitat) and proactively (reintroduction in areas with low competition potential). Conservation efforts should focus on (a) lessening conflict with livestock, particularly in key Mouflon patches; and (b) improving connectivity among priority habitat patches and between seasonal habitat through protection of stepping stones and/or translocations. Promoting private or community-based reserves with small-scale livestock production may help establish Mouflon populations with local landowners potentially co-benefiting from wildlife (e.g., tourism, trophy hunting once populations are viable) while reducing poaching risk for Mouflon.<br/><br/>In Cyprus, the Game and Fauna Service of the Ministry of Interior is responsible for Mouflon conservation. Mouflon is a strictly protected species both through its inclusion in the European Union Habitats Directive 92/43 (Annexes ΙΙ and IV) but also through the national legislation (Law 152(Ι) of 2003-2015). A species management plan has been in place since 1996 and has been updated in 2011. Key activities include: 1. Law enforcement (regular patrols to prevent and combat poaching), 2. Habitat improvements through 150 artificial watering points, food plots with winter cereals and forest clearings, 3. Population monitoring (fall counts and lamb surveys), 4. Inspection of agricultural damage and provision of advice to decrease it, and 5. Health monitoring in close cooperation with Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment (N. Kassinis, pers. comm. 2016 and presentation at the WCMU 2016 in Nikosia). The Cyprus Mouflon is listed in CITES Appendix I (valid from 26 November 2019) as “Ovis gmelini (only the population of Cyprus; no other population is included in the Appendices)”. Guerrini <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggest that until definitive light can be shed on taxonomically heterogeneous Near Eastern Mouflons, the Mouflon of Cyprus should be unvaryingly acknowledged as subspecies <em>ophion </em>not to impair conservation in the country where it resides. In the light of the genetic divergence disclosed between Cypriot and European Mouflon, they furthermore recommended banning importation of any Mouflon into Cyprus to preserve the integrity of the island population.<br/><br/>In Iran, Mouflon is a Protected Species but it can be hunted under licences issued by the Department of the Environment. Hunting is permitted in protected areas but requires a Special Licence. Unfortunately, the exact numbers of Mouflons shot each year by hunters are not available and differ substantially from year to year due to contrasting policies of promoting trophy hunting and blanket bans on all hunting. Mouflon occurs in numerous protected areas. However, poaching and livestock grazing are not fully prevented in these areas (Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. 2019). Poaching Mouflon results in a fine of around 1,785 Euro (i.e., 250,000,000 IRR; 1 Euro ~ 140,000 IRR 2020).<br/><br/>In Iraq, the most urgent conservation measure that could potentially lead to an increase in their population is declaring their habitat as a protected area and establishing ranger patrols against poaching. But this seems currently not a priority for the Kurdistan Regional Government due to the remoteness of Mouflon habitat and probably to avoid military clashes due to the proximity to the Iranian border (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020). There might be a potential for the development of community-based conservation and hunting management, including income generation from regulated trophy hunting.<br/><br/>In Turkey, Mouflon is legally protected, but strictly regulated hunting has been permitted. Captive populations are annually vaccinated against paratuberculosis and reintroduced populations are supported by vaccinated individuals. After 2010, two more captive populations (Ankara-Nallıhan and Afyon-Şuhut) and one more re-introduced population (Aksaray-Ekecik) were established. Mengüllüoğlu <em>et al</em>. (2019) found the existing reintroduction site of Mouflon in Sarıyar (Northwestern Anatolia) unsuitable due to high anthropogenic disturbance and interruption of migration routes by a reservoir and recommend wild ungulate reintroductions to suitable areas (with lower anthropogenic disturbance and livestock densities) where local ungulate populations went extinct and replaced by livestock. Nallihan Captive breeding Center will be closed in 2021 and additional releases here will not be continued due to low habitat suitability. Instead, two new reintroduction sites are planned for 2020-21 in more suitable habitats, one in Afyon and one in Kahramanmaras (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years), but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.</p>","<p>The Siberian Ibex&#160;primarily occupies mountainous regions from 500 to-5,500 m asl in rocky terrain and open alpine meadows and crags, seeking out lower elevations during the winter (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987).

In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

They typically inhabit dry mountainous regions and select subalpine grasslands and shrublands (Bowyer and Leslie 1992). Jex <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. (2016) described&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;habitat as open yet rugged terrain that allowed sheep to forage efficiently while also supporting detection and evasion of predators.&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;habitats must contain adequate amounts of forage, escape terrain, birthing, loafing or respite areas, and unobstructed corridors through which they can move during their annual cycles. While rugged lambing habitat is essential, thinhorn populations are most sensitive to availability of high-quality ranges during winter, when animals are physiologically and nutritionally most challenged (Jex<em> et</em> <em>al</em>. 2016). In winter they prefer areas with light snowfall and strong winds that remove snow and expose forage (Nichols and Bunnell 1999). Most populations occupy distinct summer and winter ranges, although some are sedentary. Migrations are correlated with snow depth, temperature, plant phenology and regular movements to mineral licks. Most of the year is spent in the winter range in wind-swept areas that expose forage (Bowyer and Leslie 1992). Stochastic weather events associated with global climate change and more cyclical climatic influences such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation can affect precipitation, temperature regimes, soil moisture, plant growing conditions and have the potential to also affect individual growth and population levels of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;(Hik and Carey 2000).<br/> <br/> Adult males can occupy six seasonal home ranges: pre-rutting, rutting, midwinter, late winter and spring, salt-lick, and summer (Bowyer and Leslie, 1992). Females usually have four ranges: winter, spring, lambing, and summer. Lambs inherit home ranges from older individuals and they return annually to these inherited ranges (Bowyer and Leslie, 1992). There seems to be no competition with other ungulates in their ranges for food or space.&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;have a broad complement of predators within their distribution, among which are wolverines <em>Gulo gulo</em>, golden eagles <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>, bears (black <em>Ursus americanus</em> and grizzly <em>Ursus arctos</em>), lynx <em>Lynx canadensis</em>, wolves <em>Canis lupus</em>, and coyotes <em>Canis latrans</em>. Stone’s sheep may also fall prey to cougars <em>Puma concolor</em>, but those felids are generally absent or occur at very low densities throughout the majority of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;range (Jex<em> et</em> <em>al</em>. 2016). Lohuis (2016) found coyotes and golden eagles to be responsible for approximately 40% and 20% of lamb predation events on collared lambs, respectively. <em>Deep snow, low temperatures, high population density, disease and parasites, low-quality forage, and predation are primary sources of mortality, especially among lambs (Bowyer and Leslie 1992 and </em>Jex<em> et</em> <em>al</em>. 2016<em>). In addition, increasing pressures associated with exploitative, interference and apparent interspecific competition can be influenced by human interventions and expanded ranges of other species leading to negative impacts on Thinhorn Sheep at localized scales</em> (Jex<em> et</em> <em>al</em>. 2016).<em></em>","<p>This species is primarily affected by hunting, both for sport and subsistence. Licensed harvest (i.e., excludes indigenous harvest) is tightly managed, and hunting is not an overall threat to the species.</p><p>There are three main threats to&#160;Thinhorn Sheep: 1) Habitat change from global climate change and human alterations; 2) Disease and parasites; and 3) Competition/Predation from changing predator-prey compositions and distributions.&#160; Jex <em>et al</em>. (2016) more fully describes current and anticipated threats to&#160;Thinhorn Sheep. More specifically, the species is exceptionally sensitive to pathogens predominantly transmitted from domestic sheep and domestic goats, with the concern so great that several jurisdictions have implemented specific restrictions on domestic sheep and domestic goat import, use, health testing and transport (Yukon and Northwest Territories and parts of British Columbia); Alaska and the remaining areas in British Columbia are actively developing other restrictions. If domestic sheep or goats came into contact with&#160;Thinhorn Sheep, catastrophic all-age die-off followed by years of chronic poor lamb production would likely result.&#160; Climate change may also affect&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;by changing the timing of seasons, precipitation regimes, snow accumulation, winter icing events that restrict access to forage, and losses of alpine grassland ecosystems as tree-lines move upslope. The possible effects of climate change are currently unquantified but could lead to poor synchronization of birth with the period of greatest forage quality and availability, or changes to parasite life-cycles that result in reduced fitness and reproductive productivity (Aleuy <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>","<p>The most recent global population update is in 2010 by Larkins (2012), which did not include the Yukon Territory. Assuming a relatively stable population, this assessment uses estimates from Hoefs and Barichello (1985) for the Yukon. Total population of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;in Canada is <em>46,000-62,000</em> animals. Of this total, 33,400 – 45,600 are Dall’s sheep, and 12,600 – 16,400 Stone’s. The total U.S. population was estimated at 50,000 to 64,000 animals in 2000 (Larkins 2012).&#160; The total population of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;is therefore 96,000 – 126,000. Assuming that 60% of the population is made up of mature individuals, there are 57,600 – 75,600 mature&#160;Thinhorn Sheep.</p>",Stable,"<p>This species is found in the United States of America (USA) (Alaska), through the Yukon and Northwest Territories, to northern British Columbia (Canada). <br/> <br/>Thinhorn Sheep&#160;are represented by two subspecies in Canada. Dall’s sheep <em>O. d. dalli</em> occurs west of the Mackenzie River throughout the Richardson and the Mackenzie mountains on the Yukon-Northwest Territories border, throughout the mountainous regions in Yukon, and south into the northwest portion of British Columbia’s St. Elias and Coast mountains. Stone’s sheep <em>O. d. stonei</em> is found only in Canada with British Columbia hosting the vast majority of the global population.&#160; Its overall range extends from an area of integration with Dall’s sheep along the southern border in south-central Yukon (Cassiar and Pelly mountains), south and southeast through the Cassiar, Kaska, northern Rocky, and Skeena and Omineca mountains in British Columbia. </p>  <p>In Alaska, Dall’s sheep occupies drier areas of the Kenai, Chugach, Wrangell, and Talkeeetna mountains, and the Alaska and Brooks ranges. Scattered populations also occur in the low mountains between the Tanana and Yukon rivers. A recent genetic analysis has re-confirmed the presence of the two subspecies (Sim <em>et al</em>. 2016), with Dall’s sheep being grouped into 5 discrete genetic subpopulations and Stone’s into 3 genetic subpopulations (Sim <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2018); this work has led to revisions to previous subspecies distribution mapping.</p>","<span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1"">Thinhorn Sheep&#160;do exist in zoos in both Canada and the USA, and on wildlife/game preserves, predominantly sourced from ‘rescued’ lambs brought into the rearing facilities which become non-releasable.&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;have a long history of Indigenous harvest and since colonization in western North America, are also highly prized and hunted for food and as a game animal.

All non-indigenous harvest, or indigenous non-cultural harvest, requires government inspection and certification.</span></span>",Terrestrial,"In Canada, three National Parks (Kluane, Nahanni and Ivvavik), covering 36,976 km², protect <em>ca.</em> 3,200 Dall’s sheep (i.e., <em>ca.</em> 12% of the estimated total Canadian population) from industrial development and sport hunting. Territorial wildlife reserves include no provision for habitat protection, but <em>ca.</em> 2,700 Dall’s sheep within these reserves are off limits to non-aboriginal hunters. Several protected areas in British Columbia allow a limited harvest of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep. Management involves regulating annual licensed harvests, habitat enhancement, usually through burning, limited predator control, and involvement in the environmental screening process with respect to access, mining, forestry and agriculture on crown land. Aboriginal Peoples are permitted by Yukon and Northwest Territories Acts (1898) and in British Columbia, to hunt&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;for subsistence and cultural purposes within and outside national and territorial parks, and wildlife reserves. Similar treaty rights were granted to Aboriginal People in northeastern British Columbia in 1906. Outside national parks, licensed harvest of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;is regulated by territorial or provincial wildlife acts and associated regulations. Status Indians are not required to possess a hunting license. Only in Yukon is the Aboriginal sheep harvest systematically estimated, and overall, it is believed to be minimal. Adult males with horns of 4/5 curl (Northwest Territories) or full curl (Yukon and British Columbia) can be hunted by non-aboriginal hunters under license, with mandatory reporting of kills. Wildlife regulations can be amended annually with ministerial consent, and are strictly enforced. Typically, trends in the number and age of males killed by licensed hunters provide the basis for more restrictive management. Quotas or limited-entry hunting, that set a ceiling on the harvest or restrict hunting opportunities, have been implemented in some areas to further control hunting pressure. The licensed annual harvest of&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;typically averages 280 in Yukon (Hoefs and Barichello 1985), 200 in the Northwest Territories (Poole and Graf 1985) and 500 in British Columbia, where a decline in ram horn size has been observed in the Peace area with intense harvest, and attributed to an evolutionary consequence of selective hunting (Douhard et al. 2016). No change was observed in the Skeena area where harvest intensity is lower. Guided, non-resident hunters account for about 70% of the total licensed&#160;Thinhorn Sheep&#160;harvest.<br/> <br/> In the USA, Dall’s sheep occurs in eight Federal protected areas in Alaska: Denali, Gates of the Arctic, Lake Clark, Noatak, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks; Arctic, Kenai, and Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuges; and Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve. Seven of these areas are among the largest such reserves in the USA. About 70% of all Dall’s sheep in Alaska occur in hunted areas. Most harvest is regulated by the state, though federal regulations are being used for some federal lands. Under Alaska Department of Fish and Game regulations, most harvesting of Dall’s sheep is restricted to mature males. About 1,200 to 1,300 mature males are taken each year. Native subsistence hunting is allowed in some areas. The Department monitors populations, and with other agencies, conducts research on the species. Dall’s sheep is rated secure in the US because it is abundant, widely distributed throughout its native range, and occurs in many national parks, preserves, and wildlife refuges.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

They eat fleshy leaves, evergreen leaves, plant shoots, and acorns (Jass and Mead 2004). This species is a monogamous, sexually monomorphic, territorial browser.

Furthermore, the increase of young conifer plantations, occurring from 1950s to 1970s, provided indirectly a large quantity of food for the serow and could have determined population growth. The serow is currently not at risk of extinction as a species, but some local populations in western Japan are vulnerable because of potential interspecific competition with sika deer and the decrease of forest understory.&#160;</p>  <p>In 1990s, damage by serow declined with the decrease of young plantations.

In a subsequent survey report of the Environment Agency in 1984, the distribution area and population size of serow were estimated at 39,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and 100,000 individuals, respectively. These estimates of distribution areas and population sizes for serow should be considered underestimates for the following reasons:</p><p><ol><li>In the calculation of the distribution area, sample areas did not cover the whole range inhabited by serows. There were other areas, inhabited by the serow, e.g. &#160;the mountainous backland, which were not considered.</li><li>The serow population size was calculated by multiplying the distribution area by the average population density.

In 1934, this species was designated to be a ‘Natural Monument Species’ under the Law for Protection of Cultural Properties (LPCP). In 1955, its status was raised to ‘Special Natural Monument Species’. Although serow hunting has been prohibited by laws since 1925, poaching pressure was high before the 1950s. An anti-poaching campaign was conducted throughout the country in 1959, and, after eliminating poaching, the serow population began to increase. The population increase was probably also due to an increase of suitable habitat in the form of young coniferous plantations created from mid 1950s to 1970s. However, damage to young artificial plantations and crops also drastically increased with the serow increase. Nevertheless, any capture of serows including damage control, was not permitted until 1978, with the exception of scientific research. The management measures of this species became a matter of controversy between conservationists, forest owners and/or farmers. Then the government agencies permitted to capture serows by using tranquilizer guns in 1978,&#160; but many of the captured serows died during the darting operations.<br/> <br/> The Japanese serow is managed under two laws: LPCP, and the Wildlife Protection and Hunting Law (WPHL) which was enacted in 1963 by the revision of the Hunting Act. The executive authority of LPCP is the Agency for Cultural Affairs (AFCA), and that of WPHL is Ministry of Environment (MOE). The Forestry Agency (FA) has jurisdiction over forest management policy, which concerns damage prevention and forest use. The executing organization of the LPCP in each prefecture is Board of Education of the prefectural governments, and that of the WPHL is Wildlife Management Division, Section, or Unit of prefectural governments.&#160;</p>  <p>In 1979, these three Agencies reached an agreement to change serow management measures, as previous management measures could no longer solve the problems mentioned above. The essential points of the new management policy were as follows.<br/><ol><li>To establish serow protection areas. This decision meant the designation of ‘Special Natural Monument Species’ would be repealed and instead ‘Serow Protection Areas’ would be designated based on LPCP in the future.&#160;</li><li>To allow nuisance animal control outside the serow protection areas, in cases of necessity.</li><li>The AFCA takes administrative responsibility for preservation of serow in protected areas, the MOE for managing serow outside protected areas, and the FA for avoiding damage to young coniferous plantations by non-lethal methods such as fencing and netting.</li></ol></p>  <p>Conservation NGOs and the majority of ecologists opposed to this policy change. However, this policy change was inevitable from the viewpoints of the serow population trends and social conditions at that time.<br/> <br/> Three primary functions expected to the protection areas were (1) to maintain stable and viable local populations; (2) to preserve the geographical and genetic diversity of serow populations; and (3) to establish a management system for the serow and its habitat. Of the 15 protection areas planned, 13 had been established by 1989, but the remaining two protection areas have not yet been established in Kyushu and Shikoku due to disagreements with land owners. Therefore, the Japanese serow still retains the status of ‘Special Natural Monument Species’. The size of serow protection area ranges from 143km² to 2,180 km² with total area of 11,800 km², covering about 20% of the serow range in 1983 and spanning 23 prefectures. However, in many cases, the protection areas avoid commercial forests and are situated at relatively high elevation areas including unsuitable habitats. In addition, densities of serow in most protection areas declined significantly over the last 20 years. As a result, some protection areas have not been able to maintain the minimum viable population size within them. Further expansion of each protection area faces difficulty due to social conditions e.g. land ownership. Therefore, it is necessary to conserve serow populations by integrated management of protected areas and non-protected areas, through the cooperation of the AFCA and the MOE.</p>  <p>The AFCA initiated a systematic survey of serow management for protection areas in 1985, composed of main and supplemental survey programs. The purpose of the main survey program is to monitor population trends and habitat conditions every 6 to 8 years for each protection area. This program is carried out by survey specialists. Annual supplemental surveys are carried out by non-specialist local inhabitants using simple and easy methods to monitor population indices, habitat changes and damage. The data from both surveys are used to develop the management plan for each protection area. However, since the AFCA is neither land owner nor land manager of serow protection areas, the measures that the AFCA can implement are limited to, for example, the prohibition of serow capture, monitoring of population and habitat etc.<br/> <br/> Control culling began in the restricted small areas of Gifu and Nagano Prefecture with tranquillizer guns only in 1978, and with shooting guns from 1979, and the culling area has expanded in central Honshu. As a matter of course, control cull is conducted outside the protection areas. The damage to conifer plantations in central Honshu markedly decreased in 1990s, because both the area of young conifer plantations and also population density of serow in this area have reduced. The number of serows removed in a year peaked at 1334 in 1996 and has decreased to about 500 in recent years. The total number of removed serow was about 37,000 by 2016. The serow control program that has been implemented since 1978 has led to a significant decrease of density in limited areas, but the impact on the whole population has not been remarkable. &#160;</p>  <p>Two kinds of permissions, based on LPCP and WPHL, are required for control culls of serow. The areas and periods of control, upper limit of cull number and capture methods are specified in the permits. Biological investigation of killed serow has continued since the beginning of the control. Place and date of capture, sex, age, and reproductive conditions are recorded for almost all culled individuals. In addition, studies in various fields such as ecology, morphology, pathology etc. were conducted in 1980s to 1990s. These data are used for serow management.&#160;</p>  <p>In 1999, the WPHL was amended and the ‘Specified Wildlife Management Plan System’ was established. This provided legal backing to manage local populations at each prefecture level. This plan must state specific goals for the target local populations, and prescribe concrete measure for properly controlled hunting and/or culling, preventing negative influences on the population, and conserving habitats. This adaptive management system is considered to be useful and practical for management of serow outside the protection areas. Eight prefectures are implementing such plans as of 2018, although control culling has not been conducted in two prefectures form the beginning and has been discontinued in one prefecture. &#160;</p>  <p>The management system for serow has significantly progressed during the last 40 years. While serow populations are stable or at least not at risk in most areas, the following problems negatively affect some populations.</p>  <p><ol><li>Reduction of undergrowth forage due to maturing conifer plantations from late 1950s to early 1980s, and abandonment of fuel wood forests, and over-grazing and/or browsing by sika deer may reduce food supply for serow and deteriorate habitat quality. In particular interspecific competition with sika deer, not only exploitation competition but also interference competition, are assumed to be an important cause of serow decline, though research concerning this matter is limited.</li><li>Increase of unintentional serow mortality associated with sika deer and wild boar control operations and damage prevention measure might have resulted in decrease of some local population.</li></ol></p>    <p>While the current national policy for sika deer and boar targets a 50% reduction of the population size by 2025, strict firearm control causes the use of snares and box traps as preferred methods of control. Moreover, the already few shooters are declining due to ageing. These social and political conditions in Japan place pressures to use traps and result in further worsening of the by-kill issues. The use of snare and box trap instead of guns is increasing in population control operations, and about 60% of sika deer and wild boar catches are by trapping. It is difficult to ban or strongly restrict the use of snare, under current social circumstances in Japan, but various efforts are underway to reduce by-kill.</p>  <p>There are two issues that currently serow management is facing.</p>  <p><ol><li>The top priority issues requiring urgent action are to avoid serow extinction in western Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and recovery of these populations. It is necessary to clarify the feasible conservation procedures for these populations and create specific management plans for each population.</li><li>The second issue is distribution management of serow. The serow distribution has been expanding to low altitude areas, and overlap between serow distribution and cultivated land and human residential area is increasing. In addition, it is assumed that serow densities in the areas adjacent to farmland and residential areas is relatively high, while the densities in mountainous areas decrease. These phenomena should lead to an increase of conflict between serow and humans, such as damage on agriculture, human injuries caused by serow, and destruction of house gardens.</li></ol></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

There are small pockets with reasonable densities of tahr but vast areas devoid of them. Overall, tahr populations are on the decline, as indicated by sharp drops and disappearance in some areas, and declining habitat quality, ongoing poaching and impact of livestock as competitor, in other areas. It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years) and the species nearly meets the criteria A2bcde for Vulnerable, but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.","<p>Since Burrard’s (1925) hunting account, Himalayan Tahr has been known to traverse the steepest precipices. In general, they inhabit steep rocky mountain slopes, between 3,000–4,000 m asl, with woods and rhododendron <em>Rhodondendron</em> sp. scrub (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/></p>  <p>In Nepal, various surveys—like those in Kang Chu area (Schaller 1973), Everest National Park (Ale 2007), Langtang National Park (Green, 1979) and Annapurna Conservation Area (Gurung 1995)—reported that tahr occupy various habitat types from open alpine grassland and subalpine scrubland to sparse or even dense forests (tahr winter habitat). Precipitous cliffs break the continuity of these habitats. The best tahr habitat in the Everest region can be described as cliff faces broken by ledges supporting grasses, forbs and shrub mats at higher altitudes (mean 3,863 m, SE=0.9, range 3,260 m - 4,800 m, n=191) and patches of open pine or birch forest at lower altitude (mean 3,621 m, SE=1.4, range 3,300 m - 4,031 m, n=66). Tahr was reported from as high as 5,200 m (e.g., in Langtang: Fox 1974) and as low as 2,500 m in Kang Chu (Schaller 1977). In these mountains, steep hill slopes and undulating terrains are often characteristically interrupted by abrupt cliffs which act as oasis for these cliff-huggers whose presence is often predictive in these enclaves. This cliff-hugging behaviour of tahr restricts its own distribution (Ale 2007) and perhaps limits its group size as well. </p>  <p>Himalayan Tahr is diurnal, with varying group sizes depending on the degree of habitat ruggedness that characterizes particular localities. Group size of tahr is also influenced by the abundance of food and predation pressure. For instance, in Everest, group size ranged from 1-46 (average of ca. 8, n=277), during 2004 to 2006 (Lovari 1992, Ale 2007). The average group size increased over the decade in Everest perhaps in response to the return of snow leopards to the region (Ale 2007). Tahr formed comparatively larger groups in Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Conservation Area (13.8, range 1-57, n=134: Gurung 1995) and Langtang (average 15, largest group 77: Green 1979). Both Annapurna and Langtang lacked large predator, such as the snow leopard, in alpine and subalpine habitat, but most of these areas were characterized by undulating grasslands and scrublands thereby providing more plant forages for herbivores. <br/></p>  <p>The prevalence of local hunting may also influence the average group size. In Himachal Pradesh, western Himalaya (India), group size was very small (ca. 1.7, n = 7) with severe hunting in the past (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1983). This may have been reflected in the overall density reported from different study sites. In Everest, the tahr density was ca. 3.4/km<sup>2</sup> (with no human hunting but presence of large predator). Gurung (1995) reported tahr at the density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup> from Annapurna, with no human hunting and no large predator. In the absence of local hunting or natural predation, food can be the principle factor liming the size of populations. In overall Langtang (with no large predator and no human hunting), Tiwari (2006) reported 8.72 tahr/km<sup>2</sup> (8 herds, 218 individuals, in an area of 25 square kilometre). In the Langtang region of Langtang National Park, local density of tahr reached as high as 24/km<sup>2</sup> (Green 1979: 170 in 7 km<sup>2</sup>), where tahr was neither hunted nor its habitat grazed by livestock. On the other hand, Yala region of Langtang National Park, with ten times more domestic sheep and eight times more cattle than Langtang region, reached low tahr density (6/km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of hunting in parts of New Zealand, tahr attained densities of &gt;30/km<sup>2 </sup>(Tustin and Challies, 1978). Female groups can reach very high densities in New Zealand, with groups of 100–150 commonly observed in areas that have not been hunted (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data). With regular hunting their population, however, maintained a density of ca. 5/km<sup>2</sup> (Tustin and Challies 1978)</p>  <p>Mating occurs from October to January, with it peaking around the first half of December (Lovari, S., unpubl. data). One or occasionally two kids are born in June and July after a gestation of 180-242 days. The age at sexual maturity is 1.5 years, with captive animals living up to 22 years (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2008). Females have home ranges of about 2 km<sup>2</sup> centred on rock bluffs. Males appear to be highly mobile, and outside of the rut are segregated from females (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Himalayan Tahr is known to eat grass, herbs and some fruits. On Mt. Everest, tahr’s diets consisted typically of such grasses and sedges as <em>Carex, Avena</em>, <em>Poa</em>, <em>Trisetum</em>, <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Imperata</em>. (Shrestha et al. 2002): overall, the diets were composed of 47% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 28% grasses and 25% sedges. This was similar to that Green (1979) reported for tahr in Langtang valley (38% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 34% grasses, 21% sedges, 4% ferns and 4% mosses). Green (1979) found in winter tahr supplemented its diet with small amounts of mosses and ferns, presumably because other food is less readily available. The diets of livestock and tahr were similar in the Everest region, but the proportion of woody plants (<em>Rhododendron</em> and <em>Cotoneaster</em>) was higher and that of grasses and sedges were lower in the diet of livestock than tahr. </p>","<p>The major threats in China are uncontrolled hunting and deforestation. In India, Himalayan Tahr is hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Tahr possibly survive in small patches of steep, rugged forests around the sub-alpine zone, while much of its habitat is lost due to heavy pressure from local people and from developmental pressures. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, and poaching. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated. Besides threats related to anthropogenic activities, avalanches during winters with high snowfall also can be a significant mortality factor for tahr.</p>","<p>No global population estimate of Himalayan Tahr is currently available. The rate of its population change is unknown.<br/><br/>Only a few Himalayan Tahr have been observed in China (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986). Perhaps, between 400 and 500 tahr, all located in southern Tibet, may exist in China (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>No estimate of tahr population in India is available, however, a number of sporadic counts of tahr are available from across the range. In Himachal Pradesh, for instance, approximately 130 in Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary, and over 100 in Great Himalayan National Park (S. Pandey, pers. comm.) were reported. Population estimates have also been reported from parts of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary: 70 in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1994), and 110 in the Tungnath region of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Kittur <em>et al</em>. 2006). One survey between 1996 and 1998 indicated 50 tahr inhabiting Tirthan valley of the Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). Kandpal and Sathyakumar (2010) reported tahr from the Pindari glacier area. A recent high altitude ungulate survey in 2016 estimated 297 tahr (range: 222–565, 0.32 animals/sq. km) from Uttarakhand (Habib <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest several local extinctions of tahr in India (Sathyakumar, S., unpubl. data). They may be close to extirpation from western parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The entire population reported earlier from north of the Chenab River (between Kisthwar and the Banihal pass) is believed to be locally extinct now. Small populations of tahr survive in Bani-Sarthal (Kathua) and Kisthwar National Park (Kisthwar-Doda) (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates ranging from as high as 19.6 to 25.7<span lang=""EN-IN""> per km² (Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttarakhand) (Sathyakumar 1994) and from as low as 1.4 to 4.6 <span lang=""EN-IN"">per km² (Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh) (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999) have been reported from different parts of Western Himalaya.<br/><br/></span>A different abundance index, that is, encounter rates (number/km walked) indicated tahr was less abundant in Nanda Devi National Park than Tungnath in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1993, 1994). Also, the tahr population was denser in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary than Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). A camera trap survey (trap nights/100 days) from the upper catchment of Bhagirathi River revealed higher abundance of tahr in temperate habitat (4.4 ± 2.62) than alpine habitat (0.6 ± 0.34) (Pal <em>et al</em>., in press). In Sikkim, an intensive study in Prek Chu Catchment found the presence of Himalayan Tahr in subalpine and alpine zone, but they were rare compared to other ungulates such as blue sheep (Bhattacharya 2013).<br/><br/>No total population size estimates of tahr are available for Nepal, but there have been several sporadic surveys from different parts of the country over the decades. Bauer (1988) estimated 1,000 tahr for Sagamartha, Makalu-Barun and Langtang National Parks. These three regions obviously support more tahr than Bauer’s estimates, as revealed by relatively recent studies (see below).<br/><br/>Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park can easily support 700-800 tahr, at least half of them occurring in Namche, Phorste, Thame and Gokyo valleys, in an area of <em>ca</em> 160 km². The overall mean group size was 8.5, from 2004 to 2006, with an overall density of 3.4/km2 (Lovari et al. 2009, Ale 2007). Between 1989 and 2010, there was a decrease of tahr by some 2/3, from ca 350 to <em>ca</em> 100 tahr, in the core area of Sagarmatha National Park because of increased predation following the return of the snow leopard (Lovari &amp; Mishra 2016). The recent data are lacking but numbers of predator and prey may have estabilised by now in Everest (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The most recent survey, in 2012, revealed a minimum of 394 tahr from Langtang in ca. 79.3 km² (density 5.3 tahr/km²: Thapa 2012). Green’s (1978) density estimates in Langtang National Park were similar in some localities (6.8 per sq. km) but in other localities they reached as high as s 25.0 per square kilometre.<br/><br/>Tahr has been reported from all of Nepal’s mountain protected areas but there have been no systematic surveys in these parks. No data on tahr are available from Gaurishankar Conservation Area, but in 2010 a short survey on the status of snow leopards also revealed the presence of tahr in Rolwaling valley in Gaurishankar. Their numbers, however, were dwindling (just 12 individuals observed, although with a decent kid-to-female ratio of 0.7: Ale <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent survey (Devkota <em>et al</em>. 2017) in an area of 124.2 km<sup>2</sup> in the upper reaches of Tsum valley, in Manaslu Conservation Area, revealed 223 tahr (nine herds, average group size of 25, range 2 to 74 individuals; a density of 1.8 animals per km<sup>2</sup>). Earlier in 2012, just two-day observations yielded at least 400 in the Tsum Valley and a similar number from the Budhi Gandhaki Valley in Manaslu (Sandro Lovari and Madhu Chettri, unpubl. data). The recent status of tahr in Annapurna Conservation Area is lacking but Gurung (1995) counted over 500 tahr in Annapurna Base Camp (density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>A total of 285 tahr were reported from Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by Kandel <em>et al</em>. (2011). Tahr has been sighted in Shey Phoksundo, Khaptad, and Rara National Parks, in western Nepal. Even though there have been no formal surveys, each of these parks were reported to support at least 50 tahr, according to local experts (quoted in Gurung, 1995). Many districts that fall outside of protected areas, such as Dolpo, Jumla, Humla and Jajarkot, have been reported to contain sparse populations of tahr (Raju Acharya, Karan B. Shah, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest that considerable local extinctions of tahr have taken place in Nepal. Overall, conservative estimates of tahr population for entire Nepal may not exceed 10,000 (Som B. Ale, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The potential habitat of Himalayan Tahr, worldwide, between 2,200 m and 4,200 m elevation, is estimated at <em>c.</em> 44,200 km<sup>2</sup> with most areas being in Nepal (that is, 22,455 km<sup>2</sup>), followed by India (20,248 km<sup>2</sup>) and China (1,465 km<sup>2</sup>). Suitable tahr habitat occurs in Himachal Pradesh (8,903 km<sup>2</sup>), Uttarakhand (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and Sikkim (865 km<sup>2</sup>), and Jammu and Kashmir (3,979 km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>The current global population of Himalayan Tahr in its native range (that is, China, India and Nepal) is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but it may not exceed the size of introduced populations in New Zealand, South Africa, United States of America, and Argentina (likely extinct). No attempts to census tahr populations have been made from the other countries except from New Zealand. The total abundance of tahr in New Zealand alone, from 2016 to 2018, was placed between 24,777 and 47,461, with average density ranging from 0.06 to 9.2 tahr/km<sup>2</sup>.</p>",Decreasing,"Himalayan Tahr is found in the Himalaya of China, India and Nepal spread over an estimated 44,200 km², however the actual area of occurrence may be much smaller given extirpation and currently unsuitable habitats in between. Outside the Himalayas, tahr was introduced to the South Island of New Zealand and Western Cape Province in South Africa (Grubb 2005). They were accidentally released in Cibola National Forest Mountain (New Mexico, USA) from a game ranch, and in Neuquén province and Parque Diana ranch of Argentina perhaps illegally by ranchers (Flueck 2010), and possibly now extinct from Neuquén (Guichon <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, Himalayan Tahr was discovered in 1974 in Quxiang of Buoqu Valley (aka Zhangmu Valley) in southern Tibet (Beijing Natural History Museum and Qinghai Institute of Biology 1977). Since then, there has been no additional information pertaining to its occurrence or status. A confirmed report of species presence came from Tibet’s Geelong-Buoqu Valleys (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986, Wang 1998, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Qomolangma Nature Reserve (pers. comm., Labaciren) where numbers of tahr have been sighted regularly in the Rongxia and Chentang valleys.<br/><br/>In India, Himalayan Tahr occurs along subalpine regions across southern forested slopes in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim (Sathyakmuar 2002). Populations are patchily distributed from south-central Kashmir through the southern part of Kullu (Himachal Pradesh) between c. 2,000 and 3,300 m (Gaston et al. 1981, 1983). They are widely present at similar elevations from northern Uttarakhand all the way to the border of Nepal. Small numbers of tahr also inhabit east Sikkim (nearby India-Nepal border) and west Sikkim (close to India-Bhutan border).<br/><br/>In Nepal, Himalayan Tahr formerly had a continuous distribution between 1,500 m and 5,200 m, but this has been increasingly disrupted by human activities such as livestock-grazing and subsistence hunting (Green 1978, 1979, Ale, S. B. unpubl. data). Overall, in Nepal, tahr inhabits temperate to sub-alpine forests and alpine meadows, mainly between <em>ca</em> 2,500 m and 4,000 m, but individuals at times venture up to 5,200 m. Schaller (1977) mapped fourteen locations of tahr in Nepal, but there are undoubtedly more.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, tahr is reported from the Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve (Tshewang <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Bhutan Government’s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forest and Park Services has not confirmed its presence in the country (Sonam Wangdi, December 2019, pers. comm.).","<p>In New Zealand, there is occasional commercial harvesting of tahr for meat. There is a substantial recreational hunt of this species, and adult males (≥4.5 years old) are highly sought after as trophies by recreational and trophy hunters.</p>  In Nepal’s only in one hunting reserve, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Himalayan Tahr is harvested for trophy (blue sheep, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em>, were more sought after than Himalayan Tahr). The income thus generated has been used for conservation and local income generation activities (Karki and Thapa 2011). Two types of revenue have been generated through trophy hunting: the revenue collected by the Nepal’s government’s wildlife department, and money collected by local communities (although not substantiated on a legal basis, so monetary figures are not known: the charge to hunters may have varied from $533–1,333 for a Himalayan Tahr (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015). Locals used the money collected from tahr and blue sheep trophy-hunting for community development activities, for example, upgrading facilities of the local health post, constructing trails, and maintaining a bridge. Government revenue collected from 2007 to 2012 totalled $184,372, a portion of which went to conservation activities (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<p>Himalayan Tahr is not listed under threatened category of CITES. </p>  <p>It is listed as Category I species in China. Conservation measures proposed for China included undertaking surveys to determine the species’ distribution and status in Qomolangma Nature Reserve&#160;(Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Qomolangma&#160;Nature Reserve started the snow leopard program in 2015 funded by Vanke Foundation. The program undertook a large-scale wildlife survey and subsequent conservation projects that included educating local communities about tahr and other wildlife. </p>  <p>In India, protected areas with Himalayan Tahr include: Jammu and Kashmir – Kishtwar National Park (locally threatened); Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan National Park (confirmed), and Daranghati (locally threatened), Gamgul Siahbehi, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Manali (locally threatened or extinct), Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttarakhand -Nanda Devi and (probably) Valley of Flowers National Parks, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; and Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983, Green 1987; Kathayat and Mathur 2002). Tahr uses rugged forested slopes with temperate oak and pine forests, well below the subalpine areas where it is often currently located. This suggests that its current range distribution may reflect displacement from formerly used lower elevation areas. Conservation measures proposed for India include: 1) extend the Great Himalayan National Park as proposed, 2) establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh), 3) devise innovative community based reserves for the species outside protected areas (these need to include community based protection, tourism, awareness, etc.), and 4) include areas with tahr in the innovative, participatory, landscape level planning and action under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Project Snow Leopard. Overall, the country’s conservation strategy clearly states conserving species in and outside protected areas.</p>  <p>A significant proportion of Nepal’s tahr occurs within protected areas, but its population is widespread in areas outside of protected areas (e.g., the region that lies between Manaslu and Langtang, Bhimthang valley between Manalsu and Annapurna, and Dolpo, Jumla, Mugu and Humla districts). The species occurs in all mountain protected areas of Nepal: Langtang, Rara, Sagamartha (Everest), Makalu-Barun and Shey-Phoksundo National Parks; Api Nampa, Annapurna, Manalsu, Gaurishankar and Kanchanjunga Conservation Areas, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and Khaptad National Park. </p>  <p>Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) maintain the current, closely controlled, legal hunting program in Dhorpatan, 2) consider a regulated program of low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers, and 3) undertake surveys to understand the increasing fragmentation of tahr populations and offer mitigation measures. The first steps to address this issue would be to begin in selected areas by mapping tahr habitat features such as cliffs (using 1:50,000 topographic maps), followed by ground surveys to validate the species’ presence/absence.</p>  <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only reserve in Nepal that allows trophy hunting of Himalayan Tahr along with blue sheep. From 2008 to 2011, Karki and Thapa (2011) reported 34 Himalayan Tahr were harvested: 18 in 2008/09 (100% harvest; quota set by the government), 11 (61% in 2009/10) and 5 (28 % in 2010/11). A quick glance on the numbers harvested indicates they were not so small numbers if adult males have been the only target. It would mean some 10-15 % of the adult male (trophy) population (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm). Perhaps the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation – Nepal should consider revaluating the trophy hunting of tahr on a sustainable basis.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Although they descend to sea level in coastal areas, they are primarily an alpine and sub-alpine species. Throughout the year, the animals usually stay above timberline, but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Summertime movements to low-elevation mineral licks often take them several or more kilometers through forested areas. Their diet includes grasses, forbs, sedges, ferns, moss, lichen, twigs, and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and conifers of their high-altitude habitat. Their main predators are cougars, wolves and brown bears. The species lives in groups that can vary from a few to a hundred, and during the winter months groups generally coalesce to form large herds. The gestation length is approximately 180 days, with a single birth typically, although twins are common in introduced populations. The average age of primiparity varies from 2 to 5 years among populations. Male mortality is higher than female mortality and very few males live longer than 10 years. Very few females survive more than 16 years (Festa-Bianchet and Côté 2008).</p>","<p>These animals are largely protected from threats due to the inaccessible nature of their habitat. The species is hunted, but regulations in both of its range states have stabilized past declines. Mountain goats are more sensitive to human disturbance than most other ungulates, and are particularly sensitive to harassment from aircraft. Increasing aircraft &#160;use, particularly helicopters, for industrial and recreational purposes on mountain goat habitat is a major concern for their conservation.</p>","In 2010, the total population in Canada was estimated at 43,700 to 70,200, distributed as follows: Alberta 2000; British Columbia 39,000-65,500; Northwest Territories 1,000 (earlier estimate); and Yukon 1,700. Recent total estimates in the United States are 37,000 to 47,000 individuals, with more than 13,000 animals in the contiguous states, and 24,000 to 33,500 in Alaska. (Myatt and Larkins 2010)<br/><br/>Some historic ranges in southern part of distribution are now unoccupied.&#160; These historic declines were likely due to overharvest, partly because managers initially did not realize that this species can only tolerate a very small amount of harvest in native populations.",Stable,"<p>This species is found in southeast Alaska (USA), south Yukon and southwest Northwest Territories (Canada) to north-central Oregon, central Idaho, and Montana (USA). It has been introduced to Kodiak, Chichagof, and Baranof Islands (Alaska), Olympic Peninsula (Washington), central Montana, Black Hills (South Dakota), and to Colorado, Utah and northeastern Nevada (USA) (Grubb 2005).<br/> <br/> In Canada, mountain goats inhabit all major mountain ranges from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, west to the Coastal Range of British Columbia, and north into the St. Elias, Coast, Cassiar, Logan and Selwyn Ranges of Yukon; and the Mackenzie Mountains of the Northwest Territories. In Alaska, the mountain goat is generally continuously distributed along the mountains extending up the west coast to Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula. It also occurs in the southern Wrangell and Talkeetna Mountains and the northern Chugach Mountains. Goat populations have been established through transplants on Baranof and Kodiak Islands. In the contiguous states, it is found in a relatively continuous distribution across several large mountain ranges in Washington, Idaho and Montana. Mountain goats are also discontinuously distributed to the east and south of this area, where many herds have been established by transplanting animals, sometimes outside of known historic range.</p>",Hunting is now well managed in most jurisdictions. Changes in management regimes have stabilized past declines.,Terrestrial,"<p>In Canada, mountain goat habitat, along with more than 3,500 goats, are protected in eight National Parks (Banff, Glacier, Jasper, Kootenay, Nahanni, Revelstoke, Waterton and Yoho), Kluane National Park Reserve, and in Kluane Wildlife Sanctuary. Numerous provincial parks and wildlife reserves throughout western and northern Canada provide additional varying levels of protection. Limited hunting by aboriginal people is permitted in some northern national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and licensed hunting is permitted in many provincial parks. Outside protected areas, goats are legally hunted under strict controls issued by provincial or territorial government agencies. Harvests are set annually for each population. In British Columbia, for example, harvest rates vary between populations and range from 0.4 to 94% (BC Mountain Goat management Plan 2010) with about 600 goats shot by resident and non-residents each year. Aboriginal harvest is unknown. In Yukon, sport harvests are much lower, varying between three and 15 animals per year, with the aboriginal harvest estimated to be zero. Transplants have been used to re-introduce mountain goats into many areas of their former range. Habitat management continues to play a key role in its conservation, and developments are subject to environmental screening processes on public land. Conservation measures proposed for Canada: 1) Determine the species’ requirements for mature forests on steep slopes in coastal mountain ranges that are used as winter habitat in British Columbia (Hebert and Turnbull, 1977, Fox <em>et al</em>. 1989). Several coastal populations will be affected by current and future timber harvest operations. Ideally, much or most of this habitat should be preserved. 2) Obtain more accurate population inventories in all regions of Canada to allow more detailed management plans to be developed. 3) Encourage research on the possible effects of climate change on habitat trends, nutritional quality and snow cover.<br/> <br/> In the United States, primary conservation measures have included habitat protection, introductions and re-introductions, and harvest regulation. Eight state wildlife management departments have transplanted mountain goats from native ranges in Canada and the United States. Six of these states did not have native populations. Many transplanted populations were established with only 10 to 15 founder animals. Goats are harvested in nine states under conservative regulations of the wildlife departments which monitor populations. The mountain goat occurs in nine federal protected areas: Alaska: Glacier Bay, Kenai Fjords, and Wrangell - St. Elias National Parks; and Kenai National Wildlife Refuge; Montana: Glacier National Park; South Dakota: Mount Rushmore National Monument; Washington: North Cascades, and Mount Rainier National Parks. However, most herds are in national forests including many wilderness areas. One state, Colorado, uses two hunting licenses in an auction and a raffle to raise funds for these activities.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Recent studies indicate that the distribution and abundance of the species do not warrant a threatened status at this time although populations are declining where they come in contact with human populations.","This species occurs in moderately humid to dry regions  where there are areas of woody or brush cover. It is not found in the Amazon region and it avoids dense forests in other regions as well, although it occupies the edges of forests. It does not live in open areas but will feed in these areas, including many types of agricultural plantations, if cover is available nearby. It is found in both dry and moist Chaco regions (Cartes 1998, Chiarello 1999, Gonzalez 2004, Pinder 1997, Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997, Rivero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>It eats  a wide variety of plant species and is a selective feeder. It has pulses of frugivory depending on the area, season and availability of frutis, but is not essentially frugiverous in many areas, its habitat is not consistent with a frugivorous diet since it avoids forests where most of the fruit is found (Caballero 2001, Cartes 1998, Julia 2002, Pinder 1997, Stallings 1984).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs almost all year around with births in all months except May, June and July in Argentina and Bolivia and correlated with the rainy season in Brazil (Chavez 1999, Julia 2002). There is a post partum estrus and a gestation period of 7 months.<br/><br/><em>Mazama gouazoubira</em> is a small to medium sized deer, with head and body length 882-1060 mm, tail length 83-190 mm, and ear length 95-121 mm (Rossi 2000), shoulder height 500-650 mm and weight 11-25 kg (Duarte and Jorge 1998).  In Brazil, regional, ecological and individual variations in coloration of <em>M. gouazoubira</em> have frequently been reported (Duarte 1996, Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997, Rossi 2000). Light and brownish colors prevail in individuals living in grasslands, while forest populations tend to be darker and grayer, significant individual variation exists within a single population. <em>M. gouazoubira</em> can be readily distinguished from the most similar species, the Amazonian Brown Brocket <em>Mazama nemorivaga</em>, by its orange rump and dorsal side of the tail, larger rounded ears, smaller eyes and orbital cavities, and wider auditory bulla rather than chocolate brown rump and dorsal side of the tail, small pointed ears, large eyes, large orbital cavities, and narrow auditory bulla of the latter species (Duarte 1996, Rossi 2000).","In Argentina populations are generally declining due to hunting pressure and habitat loss. International hunting expeditions are organized in Argentina (Julia 2002). In Bolivia the populations seem to be staying constant in spite of great hunting pressure. In Brazil this is the most abundant deer species in the country, but populations are declining in certain areas (Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro). In Paraguay, the populations in general are remaining constant, but the species has disappeared from recently urbanized areas and areas of high human density. In general there is heaving hunting pressure and loss of animals due to kills by dogs as well as habitat loss.","Populations seem to be decreasing due to the advance of human populations. There is no evidence of fragmented populations and the species continues to be abundant in most of its range, decreasing or disappearing when close to human populations. Densities vary greatly. In Brazil densities of 0.35 – 1 individual/km² have been found (Pinder 1997), in Bolivia densities of 5-12 individuals/km² have been found (Rivero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).",Decreasing,"The Brown Brocket deer is found east of the dry, pre-Andean regions in Argentina and Bolivia, extending to the Atlantic coast on the west, its northern limit is south of the Amazon region and its southern limit includes all of Uruguay and up to the province of Entre Rios in Argentina.  Although some authors report its distribution throughout all of Brazil, more recent evidence indicates its substitution by <em>M. nemorivaga</em> in the region of the Amazon (Duarte 1996, Duarte and Jorge 1998, Rossi 2000, Weber and Gonzalez 2003).",Trade of this species is probably increasing (Julia 2002 pers. comm.).,Terrestrial,"The species occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its distribution: 5 national parks and 9 provincial reserves in Argentina; in almost all national parks and private reserves in Paraguay; in 7 national protected areas in Bolivia and in numerous protected areas in Brazil.  Hunting is illegal in many places (several Argentine provinces, for example) but the bans are not enforced. Recommended actions would be to implement and enforce controls on hunting, control stray dogs and to educate rural and village populations to conserve the deer rather than immediately trying to kill any individual that they see in the area.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22155877,41788,Cervus nippon,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern because of its abundant, increasing population in Japan, and stable population in Russia. The subpopulation in Taiwan is evidently holding steady. However, all other free-ranging subpopulations are very seriously threatened. In China all subpopulations are small (the largest numbering about 500) and fragmented, and the species appears to be in danger of extirpation in Korea and Viet Nam (possibly already extinct). In terms of applying the Red List Criteria to the species globally, the large subpopulation in Japan masks all population trends from elsewhere within its range, leading to a Least Concern listing. However, it is a priority to conduct new assessments of the mainland subspecies as soon as possible.","This species prefers woodlands and forest with dense understorey, but forages in open grassy areas (Smith and Xie 2008). The main diet includes grass, some browse, and even fruit. The species is crepuscular, but sometimes active by day and night, and forages singly or in small herds, with dominant males with harems. Herds migrate to lower valleys in winter. Adults can live up to 25 years. Typically, mating occurs in autumn and gestation is about 210-223 days with young being born in April and May.<br/><br/>In Tiebu Nature Reserve, Sichuan, Sika were reported to forage preferentially in small patches of subalpine shrub and subalpine brush mixed with forest (Guo 2002). Sika fed on a wide variety of plant species in Teibu. In Viet Nam, diet of <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was reported to included browse and fruits (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In Taiwan, <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> inhabited open forests and grasslands of valley bottoms and foothills below 300 m (McCullough 1974, Horng-jye Su undated). <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> and <em>C. n. grassianus</em> probably occurred in upland forests  (IUCN 1972). <em>C. n. keramae</em> favours lowland forests and plains (WWF 1984). In Viet Nam, <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> group size was 5-30 animals (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In China, <em>C. e. sichuanicus</em> forms large aggregations during May-August (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm.). In Viet Nam, <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was thought to be primarily sedentary, although some seasonal movement took place depending on water availability (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In China, rut occurs during September-November. Fawning occurs in May-July following a 210-213 day gestation. Single fawns are the rule, but twins are sometimes observed among prime-aged females (Guo and Zheng 2005). Sexual maturity is reached at 1.5 years (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993).","This species is threatened by habitat loss and hunting, particularly in Viet Nam, China, and the Koreas. The species is increasing in Japan (where it is hunted and culled to reduce crop and forest depredation), and stable in Russia and probably Taiwan. The subspecies in Viet Nam (<em>C. n. pseudaxi</em>) and Taiwan (<em>C. n. taiouanus</em>) were hunted for meat and antler velvet for use in traditional medicine (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990, McCullough 1974). In Viet Nam, velvet from <em>Cervus nippon</em> is traded in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). All subspecies of Sika have been hunted widely in China during the past 100 years (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990) and in Korea. In Japan, Red Deer farming used to be very popular, but now animals are being released into the wild raising the risk of hybridization in the wild with <em>Cervus nippon</em>. Native and introduced populations are threatened by hybridization, with numerous populations of uncertain provenance or mixed ancestry (Grubb 2005). In China, in addition to continued loss of habitat, loss of genetic diversity through anthropogenic population subdivision is also a conservation concern (Lu <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> in Viet Nam, and <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> and <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> in China, were probably extirpated in the wild as a result of hunting and habitat conversion for agriculture (Ratajszczak 1990; Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comms.; IUCN 1972). The small captive population of <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> in Cuc Phuong National Park is presently threatened by poaching. In China, <em>C. e. sichuanicus</em> is threatened by poaching outside Tiebu Nature Reserve (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm. 1990), and by encroachment on their habitats (including by deer farms; Hu 1998). In Japan, <em>C. n. keramae</em> has been almost extirpated by hunting, and remains only on unoccupied islets where competition with feral goats and habitat change constitute serious threats (Anonymous 1990). Water pollution is a serious problem for the deer (WWF 1984).","There are no global population estimates. However, in summary, there is a large and growing population in Japan, and a stable population of 8,500-9,000 in Russia, but the species is in serious trouble in the rest of its range. There are probably fewer than 1,000 left in China, scattered in a few subpopulations across a once vast range. It is extinct in South Korea, and probably extinct in North Korea and Viet Nam. It also became extinct on Taiwan, but has been re-introduced there. More detailed information is provided below.<br/><br/><em>China</em>: Four subspecies of Sika are present in mainland China of which three are threatened and one, <em>C. n. mandarinus</em>, is probably extinct. There are 400-500 <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in the extreme north of Sichuan and in southern Gansu Province (Hu 1998), as well in two other areas (Baxi and Beihe) of Sichuan (Guo 2000). <em>C. n. kopschi</em> occurs as five isolated small populations: in the Tianmu Mountains region of northern Zhejiang (less than 30 animals); in southern Anhui (70-100); near the border with Jiangsu, in Pengze, Jiangxi (150 animals); in southern Guangxi; and possibly in northern Guangdong. <em>C. n. grassianus</em> occurred in two separate and declining populations in western Shanxi but has not been reported for some years and may now be extinct (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990; Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm., 1990). The total number in China was estimated to be no more than 1,000 animals, with populations fragments (Hu 1998). Sika are believed to be declining in all of their remaining range within China (Hu 1998, Guo 2000), although  analyses of survival of <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in Tiebu Nature Reserve during the late 1980s suggest a possible reversal of that trend (Guo and Zheng 2005).<br/><br/><em>Korea</em>: Sika was reportedly common and widespread in north and central Korea but declined severely during the Japanese occupation of the country. After liberation it proved impossible to rebuild populations naturally from the surviving dispersed animals in Hamgyong North province, so the DPRK government initiated a captive breeding programme (Won Hong Koo 1968). The genetic purity of these animals is unclear as is their relationship to the Sika held captive in DPRK nowadays. Sika is either very rare or extinct as a wild animal in DPR Korea (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). If it survives in DPR Korea, it will be in the extreme northeastern part of the country (Won and Smith 1999). It no longer survives in the wild in South Korea (Won and Smith 1999), including on Cheju Island.<br/><br/><em>Japan</em>: The species survives near heavily populated areas of Honshu, and their populations had been severely fragmented and reduced due to human activities (Yuasa <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, the Sika Deer population has been conspicuously increasing throughout Japan in recent years as hunting has been brought under control. On Hokkaido, for example, Sika have increased greatly during the last decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the early 21<sup>st</sup> century (Agetsuma <em>et al</em>. 2007), and are now considered an agricultural and forest-plantation pest (Uno and Kaji 2006). Experimental hunting of males began in the 1950s, culling of females in the 1980s and hunting of females in the 1990s (Halley <em>et al</em>. 2006). <em>C. n. keramae</em> was introduced to the Kerama Islands from the Japanese mainland during the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and is reported to have subsequently developed as an insular form (IUCN 1972).<br/><br/><em>Russia</em>: According to Kuzyakin (n.d.), there are 8,500-9,000 Sika Deer in Russia, and the population is stable.<br/><br/><em>Taiwan</em>: <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> is endemic to Taiwan. It was extirpated by 1969 and re-introduced to Kenting National Park in 1988 (Green 1989).  <br/><br/><em>Viet Nam</em>: The species may now be extinct in the wild in this country. In 1990, two to four animals were reported from the western Nghe Tinh Mountains (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990), but it is highly doubtful that they survive there. Captive populations are present in Cuc Phuong National Park and Cat Ba National Park (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990).",Increasing,"The Sika was distributed across east Asia, from central China in the west to Japan and Korea in the east, and from the extreme eastern tip of Russia in the north to southern China and Viet Nam. Specifically, it was originally found in China (formerly from Manchuria south to Guangxi, and Sichuan to Anhui), North and South Korea (including Cheju Island) (but now probably extinct in both countries), Japan, Russia (a few places in Primorsky in the Far East), Taiwan (extinct in 1969, but subsequently re-introduced), and Viet Nam (probably now extinct). Wild populations are now very localized in China. In Japan, the species ranges widely from Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, islands in the Seto Inland Sea (Awaji, Shodo, and others), Goto Islands, Ika, Yakushima, Mageshima, Kuchinoerabu-shima, Tsushima, and the Kerama Islands (introduced) (Okinawa Prefecture) (Abe 2005).<br/><br/>In China, <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> probably ranged across much of northeastern China, but by the mid-1930s its range had contracted to northeastern Jilin (IUCN 1972, Guo 1992), and is now believed to be extinct (Hu 1998, Smith and Xie 2008). <em>C. n. grassianus</em> ranged throughout western Shanxi Province, China (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Guo 1992), and is now believed to be extinct (Hu 1998, Smith and Xie 2008).<em> C. n. kopschi</em> ranged from the Yangtze River Basin eastward to the coast, and south as far as northern Guangdong Province (IUCN 1972); it remains in small numbers in southern China. <em>C. e. taiouanus</em> was widely distributed throughout Taiwan (Green 1989). Free ranging populations were extirpated in 1969, but captive individuals were re-introduced in 1989 (Smith and Xie 2008). <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was recorded from Cao Bang, Quang Ninh, Thanh Hoa, Hanoi, and Nghe Tinh provinces in Viet Nam (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990), but is probably now extinct in the wild (captive animals remain). <br/><br/>The species has been widely introduced. In the Philippines it was anciently introduced to Solo Island, with questions remaining as to its continued existence there. It was introduced in 17<sup>th</sup> century to Kerama Islands (Ryukyu Islands, Japan); and introduced in 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries to British Isles, mainland Europe (Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, western Russia, and Ukraine), New Zealand, USA, and small islands off Japan (Whitehead 1993, Wemmer 1998, Grubb, 2005). It is also widely farmed in Asia, particularly in China (Green <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Smith and Xie 2008). Only the native, extant range is included in the distribution map.",See Threats for details on Use and Trade.,Terrestrial,"The species is heavily depleted in the wild in China, and two of the Chinese subspecies may be extinct (<em>mandarinus</em> and <em>grassianus</em>), and others are threatened.

Pressure on the habitat&#160;has increased due to resettlement of victims of typhoon Haiyan, and squatting of outsiders in Busuanga (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).","The species occurs in grasslands, open woodlands and second-growth forest (Hoogstraal 1951). It has a gestation length of approximately 180 days, with typically one young, and rarely twins. Age at sexual maturity is 8-12 months, with a life span of 12-20 years. This species is diurnal, browses on leaves, and lives in small herds (Wemmer 1998). This species has a group size up to 27 individuals, but usually 7–14 (with much smaller groups reported in heavily hunted areas; Oliver and Villamor1992).","The species is threatened due to hunting pressure and human settlement and agricultural expansion over its very limited range, coupled by the evident lack of effective and sustained enforcement of the strong local protective legislation (W. Oliver pers. comm. and unpubl.). Hunting was particularly severe during the mid-1970s (Grimwood 1976), but seemingly declined in most areas during the 1980s and 1990s, except on Calauit where hunting pressure increased dramatically following the resettlement of the island by former residents under the auspices of the ‘Balik (Back to) Calauit Movement’. In 1986, 51 out of the 256 families evicted from the island ten years earlier had re-settled on the island, and by 1992 the settlers numbered nearly 500 people (Oliver 1993, W. Oliver pers. comm.). Much of the hunting of the species is recreational, and also to provide venison to the local markets (W. Oliver pers. comm.).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">More recently, pressure on the habitat has increased (and presumably hunting pressure also), due to resettlements of victims of typhoon Haiyan, and squatting of outsiders in Busuanga (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;On Calauit, introduced African ungulate populations are increasing but are probably not competing with Calamian Deer (Calauit was originally stocked with giraffe, zebra, impala, waterbuck, gazelle, eland, topi and bushbuck acquired from Kenya). A presidential proclamation that precluded removal or control of exotic species, and the movement or management of Calamian Deer on Calauit Island was recently amended, thereby also potentially enabling the better future control of the exotic ungulate populations, though in fact many of these populations have also been seriously reduced by poaching. While relatively large parts of Busuanga and Culion Islands are still undeveloped and sparsely inhabited, there are no proper reserves on either.","The species was reputedly common in all suitable localities throughout the main islands of Busuanga and Culion in the 1940s, but to have drastically declined in numbers on all parts of these islands, except in the extreme south of Culion, by the mid-1970s (Grimwood 1976). A small population of deer surviving on Calauit Island at that time was supplemented by a further 30 translocated individuals in 1977 (J. Gapuz pers. comm.), following the creation of the 'Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary' in 1976, and the eviction and resettlement of the islands former residents (Oliver 1993, Oliver and Villamor 1993). By April 1994, Calauit was reported to hold an estimated population of 1,123 ± 236 individuals (Orig and Rosell 1994); though more recent estimates indicate significant reductions in the numbers of these animals numbers following resettlement of the island by former residents and resurgence of hunting pressure. A survey in 2006 (Rico and Oliver 2008) showed the species still to be widespread on Calauit, Busuanga and Culion, though densities remain low in many areas (W. Oliver pers. comm.). It was also found still to be present on the islands of Marily and Dimaquiat.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In 2010 a field survey conducted on Busuanga (18 days), Culion (15 days) and Coron (2 days) did not record the species from any of the six surveyed sites, but secondary information indicates presence in at least four sites (Paguntalan <em>et al.</em> 2010).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Philippines, where it is restricted to the Calamian Islands in the Palawan faunal region. The species occurs on three of the four larger islands in Calamians, i.e. Busuanga, Calauit and Culion, but is absent from Coron (Oliver 1993, Oliver and Villamor 1993, Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998, Grubb 2005). The species is also reported to have occurred on at least nine other smaller islands, including three islands where small numbers of individuals translocated from Calauit were released in the late 1980s (Oliver and Villamor 1993). However, it was reported to be extinct on at least seven (78%) of these islands (Bacbac, Capari, Panlaitan, Galoc, Apo, Alava and Dicabaito), and to survive on only two of these islands, namely Marily and Dimaquiat (Rico and Oliver 2008). It is not known from anywhere else in the region, including mainland Palawan, nor the larger and intervening of island of Linacapan.","This species is hunted for food by local people, who also use hides for drums and antlers for decoration.",Terrestrial,"Calamian Deer&#160;occurs in the Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary (37.4 km<sup>2</sup>), which was established in 1976 to protect a collection of free-ranging African ungulates (see under Threats). Protection is inadequate and there are no management plans (Oliver 1993). Several hundred local people were evicted at that time it was established, but many of these have since returned to settle illegally (Oliver and Villamor 1993). Thirty animals were introduced to Calauit in 1977 to supplement a small relict population (Orig and Rosell 1994).<br/><br/>The following conservation actions are recommended:<br/><ol><li>Monitor current status on all the three islands and determine population trends. Evaluate levels of hunting and habitat loss.</li><li>Strengthen existing protected area system via establishment of new (additional) reserves and development and implementation of properly structured conservation management plan for Calauit that includes improved infrastructure, and measures to combat poaching.</li><li>Agree and establish a zoning system within Calauit in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, which enforces strict protection of the core area.</li><li>Establish protected areas on Culion and Busuanga, based on habitat and deer status surveys.</li><li>Undertake behavioural and ecological research of Calauit Deer to determine management requirements.

Due to human activities many of these semi-open habitats now exist again in the former range on Palawan.

22157381,56003281,Alces alces,Least Concern,,2016,2015-09-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This species is listed as Least Concern as it is still very widespread and extremely abundant despite fairly intense hunting pressures in parts of its range. It is expanding its range in places and it thrives in secondary habitat.,"<em>Alces alces</em> is found in a range of woodland habitats, both coniferous and broadleaved, from the tundra and taiga southwards through boreal to temperate zones. This species prefers a mosaic of second-growth boreal forest, openings, swamps, lakes and wetlands. It thrives in secondary growth, and its population expansion in Scandinavia has been linked to the replacement of natural taiga forest by secondary woodland after logging (Bauer and Nygrén 1999). It is also found in open country in the lowlands and mountains, including farmland, if there is forest nearby. The species avoids hot summer conditions by utilizing dense shade or bodies of water. Mineral licks may be an important sodium source, used in early summer in Canada and Alaska. It feeds on vegetative parts of various broadleaf trees, preferring birch, ashes and willow in the spring and summer and the twigs of these species as well as of fir, alpine, and juniper in the autumn and winter. It also eats shrubs, such as blueberry and heather, dwarf shrubs, herbs, and aquatic plants and can be a pest of agriculture and forestry in at least parts of its range (Ma Yiqing pers. comm; (Ruusila and Kojola 2010). In the search for food, some populations migrate during the year - covering up to 180 km (110 miles) in North America and 300 km (180 miles) in Asia. Whether sedentary or migratory, <em>A. alces</em> utilize specific home ranges, varying in size from 3.6 to &gt;259 km² (Hundertmark 1997).<br/><br/>The species may become sexually mature after one year (Schwartz 1997), and the maximum life span is about 20 years (Peterson 1977). It is active throughout the day and night, although there are peaks at dawn and especially at dusk.<br/><br/>Populations can be limited or regulated by complex interactions of ecological factors that vary from population to population, or ecosystem to ecosystem. Winter weather (snow accumulation) may strongly affect populations, even more so than wolf density (Mech <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1987); however, Messier (1991) found that competition for food, but not wolf predation and snow, had a regulatory impact on the species. Van Ballenberghie and Ballard (1994) found that in some naturally regulated ecosystems, predation by bears and wolves often is limiting and may be regulating under certain conditions. Messier (1994) developed population models of <em>A. alces</em>-wolf interactions. Under favourable conditions, populations are capable of large annual increases (20-25%) in population size; large populations may degrade habitat. In the presence of relatively few predators, Albright and Keith (1987) documented high calf-survival despite poor physical conditions during winter in a study of population dynamics of introduced populations in Newfoundland.<br/><br/>See Nudds (1990) for discussion of relation between the species, white-tailed deer, and meningeal (brain) worms. Brain worm (<em>Parelaphostrongylus tenuis</em>) may limit populations in areas where white-tailed deer are common (Nudds 1990). Deer are not negatively impacted by the brain worm, the larval stage of which is passed in deer faeces. Snails, often inadvertently ingested by A. alces feeding on vegetation, are the intermediate host for the worm. Deer, through worm-mediated impacts, commonly are believed to exclude <em>A. alces</em> and caribou from areas where deer occur; however, an analysis by Schmitz and Nudds (1994) concluded that the species may be able to coexist with deer, albeit at lower densities, even in the absence of habitat refuges from the disease. Whitlaw and Lankester (1994) found that the evidence that brain worm has caused <em>A. alces</em> declines is weak. The species is also severely impacted by another parasite of white-tailed deer, the winter tick (Samuel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Where there is no human, wolf or bear predation, <em>A. alces</em> may alter the structure and dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems. At Isle Royale, Michigan, browsing by the species prevented saplings of preferred species from growing into the tree canopy, resulting in a forest with fewer canopy trees and a well-developed understory of shrubs and herbs; also, browsing may have caused an increase in spruce and a decrease in balsam fir (McInnes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992).<br/><br/>Ferguson <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2000) reviewed the dynamics of 15 Canadian <em>A. alces</em> populations, and reconciled some major factors that influence various populations differently. Populations that live in greater forest cover (i.e., greater primary productivity) and with greater natural predation had more predictable population trends from year to year. Populations living in areas with low primary productivity and with low natural predation experienced more density-independent population change with lower predictability in population size.","Threats to the status of the <em>Alces alces</em> populations are primarily human-caused habitat alteration. Forestry and agricultural practices in the southern range of the species have caused massive and extensive reductions in the extent of boreal forest in southern Canada. In these areas white-tailed deer have occupied modified boreal forests that are increasingly open agricultural fields and extensive deciduous forests. Diseases from deer may also be a threat to <em>Alces alces</em>.<br/><br/>In Nova Scotia, Canada, where <em>A. alces</em> has been declared endangered, recovery issues have been listed as: genetic structure, health, illegal harvest, habitat suitability and fragmentation, and potential climate-related habitat change (Beazley <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Human-caused habitat change is also the major force causing westward expansion into non-typical habitats (i.e., rainforest ecosystems) in British Columbia. The expansion occurred concomitant with extensive logging in the Coastal Mountain Range. This has led to concerns about the future of native deer (<em>Odocoileus hemionus</em>) with the introduction of this new alternate prey species for predators and the potential introduction of diseases (Darimont <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>A wasting disease has been reported, and its causes remain poorly understood (Frank 2004), but it is not considered to be a serious problem for the species. Overexploitation caused significant population declines and range contractions in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, but since then populations have recovered (Ruusila and Kojola 2010, Bauer and Nygrén 1999). In most European range states, populations are controlled to prevent damage to forestry and arable crops (Bauer and Nygrén 1999).","It is a widespread and abundant species in most range states with the exception of China where it is extremely rare and of limited distribution (Piao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Yu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). It is common in Siberia and North Ameri<em><em><em>ca.</em></em></em> In 2003, the species was declared endangered in Nova Scotia, Canada (Beazley <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Populations have expanded and increased in western British Colombia since the mid-1900s (Darimont <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>In the last 50 years European populations have increased dramatically, there are at least 440,000 individuals of which about 50% are harvested annually (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). Numbers have increased markedly in Scandinavia in recent decades, and the range is expanding in the Caucasus. European populations show fluctuations over a multi-year cycle (Bauer and Nygrén 1999). Population estimates for European countries include the following: Czech Republic - maximum of 50 animals, Estonia - 10,000 individuals, Finland - at least 110,000 individuals (60-80,000 shot annually), Poland - 2,800 individuals, Sweden - 340,000 individuals (Pielowski and Jaworski 2005, Ruusila and Kojola 2010).<br/><br/>In North America the estimated population is approximately one million, with an annual harvest in the late 1990s of about 85,000 individuals (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011).",Increasing,"In North America it occurs in Alaska and Canada south through the Rocky Mountains, northern Great Lakes, and New England. The species is estimated to have arrived in North America from Asia about 11,000-14,000 years ago, shortly before flooding of the Bering land bridge (Hundertmark <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002b). The species' range has decreased over the past 100 years in the southern boreal forest regions in the eastern provinces of Canada (e.g., Beazley <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), but has expanded in other areas. In recent decades, it has expanded its range westward into the coastal temperate rainforests of British Columbia and some coastal islands (Darimont <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). These changes have been due to habitat changes caused by humans in boreal and rainforest ecosystems.<br/><br/>The species has a range in north Eurasia from Scandinavia, Poland, N Austria, and S Czech Republic (vagrant in Croatia, Hungary, and Romania), east to the Yenisei River (Siberia) and south to Ukraine, N Kazakhstan, N China (N Sinkiang), and possibly northern Mongolia (Wilson and Reeder 2005). It has been extinct in the Caucasus region since the 19th century (Wilson and Reeder 2005) and was introduced but now extirpated in New Zealand (Nugent <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Boyeskorov 1999, Grubb in Wilson and Reeder 2005).<br/><br/>In Europe, it has a continuous distribution extending through Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the Baltic states, Belarus, Poland and northern Ukraine. There was a small population in northern Austria, which is now extinct (although there may still be occasional migrants). There are three isolated subpopulations in southern Czech Republic, and the species is occasionally recorded in Germany, Croatia, Hungary and Romania. It has been extending its range southwards along the rivers into the northern Caucasus lowlands. It ranges from sea level up to at least 1,500 m in Europe (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006), and up to 2,500 m in the Altai mountains of Central Asia (Nygrén 1986). The species occurs east to the Yenisei River (Siberia) and south to Ukraine, N Kazakhstan, N China (N Sinkiang and the Altai region of Xinjiang, and possibly adjacent parts of Mongolia.",,Terrestrial,"It is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention. It occurs in a large number of protected areas across its range (Wemmer 1998, EMA Workshop 2006). The species is subject to intense management in some countries through hunting quotas (e.g. in Finland: Ruusila and Kojola 2010). It is protected under national legislation in a number of countries (e.g. Germany). The major conservation concern is extensive regional and landscape scale habitat change. Although Ferguson <em>et al.</em> (2000) did not analyze populations considered to be at risk, they identified populations occurring in areas with low primary productivity and low natural predation, show the least persistence and require the greatest conservation effort. Both low primary productivity and predation usually occur where humans have caused extensive habitat disturbance. This species thrives where protected from overkill by humans or predators.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22157664,41784,Axis porcinus,Endangered,A2bcd,2015,2014-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"It is still believed that the most appropriate category for Hog Deer is Endangered A2bcd (past reduction of 50% or greater in three generations, taken here as about 21 years). A detailed assessment of the Red List status of Hog Deer in 2008 convincingly showed that the species had been undergoing a serious and overlooked global decline for decades. Those authors provided the following justification which, with few caveats, is considered to still hold true for the 2014 assessment: it is considered Endangered, through a combination of population trends across its range (see below). Reflecting the ever-increasing proportion of the total native population in well secured protected areas such as Kaziranga, despite an ongoing major reduction in occupancy and number of subpopulations, future declines in the total number of animals (A3 and A4) are unlikely to be at rates in the next three generations sufficient for Endangered. However, without concerted action, within the next decade or two Hog Deer is likely to warrant again listing as Endangered through a different criterion, B2ac (c through episodic flood-caused mass mortality), reflecting the loss of all subpopulations except a handful in protected areas with effective cohesive interventions against poaching and the wealth of other, habitat-related, threats facing Hog Deer. Currently the area of occupancy is far too high for listing as Endangered on this criterion, or even, probably, as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>During the mid and later decades of the twentieth century, the global population underwent rapid range-wide reductions, with the almost total loss of Hog Deer from Southeast Asia (when it was widespread and numerous in much of Cambodia, southern Viet Nam, lowland Thailand and probably plains Lao PDR) and massive declines in the Terai Arc Landscape subpopulations consequent upon the conquering of malaria and the influx of people to the area with wholesale habitat conversion and heavy hunting. Unquestionably at this time Hog Deer global population declines were at rates consistent with Endangered listing. By the mid 1980s (i.e., the start of the relevant period for a current A2 listing), subpopulations (at least those large enough to influence the overall global decline rate) had gone from Thailand and Bangladesh and, almost certainly, from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China. It is likely that many Hog Deer remained in Cambodia, where subpopulations two to three decades ago may well have been in the thousands or even into the low tens of thousands, based on general perceptions of large-mammal abundance and relative wealth of suitable habitat (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and Myanmar, where Hog Deer was regarded as a widespread and common species of no conservation concern in the mid 1980s (various people per J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In the interim, the Cambodian population has collapsed. Although there is a dearth of information on current status in Myanmar, there is no reason to assume that such a trend is not also in train there, although it may potentially be somewhat behind Cambodia. In sum, the rate of population decline in the last 21 years in the region comprising Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, China and Bangladesh has exceeded 90%, a continuation of such declines from the 1950s onwards.<br/><br/>Populations in India and Nepal - and perhaps Pakistan and Bhutan (no recent information traced) - have not declined at anything like such a rate in the last two decades. Declines in India are likely to have been more like 30–40% over the last 21 years, although this may be an underestimate (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008); even in high-profile protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve subpopulations are not secure. Declines have been at least 30% for Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The trend in the population in Myanmar and its proportionate contribution to the overall global trend over the last three generations is the chief uncertainty. It was surely numerically large enough to have some influence on the global assessment of decline rate, given the abundance of prime habitat. Coupling the continued conversion of habitat to agriculture, the lack of protected areas specifically for the species (in contrast to those for Eld’s Deer), the uneven success of Eld’s Deer protected areas in conserving the species even with prioritised support and international collaboration, and the lack of awareness over the plight of grassland biodiversity in the country, as typified by current locations of protected areas, it is clear that whatever the surviving population of Hog Deer is in Myanmar, this is largely due to chance. In no other range state has chance resulted in the survival of large subpopulations: there has been almost regional extinction in the countries to the east of Myanmar, and a fast retraction to reasonably well-secured protected areas in the countries to the west. The current reality for Myanmar probably lies somewhere between these two, and, thus, subpopulations have probably declined by 40–60% or even more in the last three generations.<br/><br/>Combining these inferred regional decline rates, an overall global decline rate in the last 21 years of 50% is tenable. The Thai ‘wild-living’ subpopulation is re-introduced into artificially created habitats, and has not been used to influence the assessment; although it is within the species' native geographic range, it is possible that it is not the native subspecies. The Sri Lankan and Australian subpopulations, outside the native range, has not been used to influence the assessment (but seems to be declining anyway).<br/><br/>Hog Deer has not been listed as threatened prior to 2008. This was probably due in large part to a few large, high-density, South Asian subpopulations that give the appearance of ‘abundance’, but these are exceptional to its true status, of extinction across most of its former range and within much of its present range. This is not fully appreciated even at the present time, despite the analysis of Biswas and Mathur (2000) and subsequent work by Biswas across one of the two main range states (India).<br/><br/>In the six years since 2008, new subpopulations were found in Cambodia, but are probably not too small to have much influence on global population trends. However effective protection for any Cambodian subpopulations has failed to materialise, and declines in this short window have probably exceeded 90% driven by unprecedented economic development in Cambodia. The situation in Myanmar appears equally bleak, with similar current trends in exploitation of preferred habitats and weak protection measures, together with a lack of focus on the species (see also the 2014 assessment of Eld's Deer).<br/><br/>The situation in India and Nepal appears to be similar to that in 2008. A recent assessment on Northeast India, a major stronghold of the species found large local subpopulations still occur in Assam with sizeable numbers in northers West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2013). There is a small but secured subpopulation in Manipur and scattered animals in other states of the region. However in Assam sharp declines have been recorded outside the protected areas such as in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts (Chodhury 2007).","Hog Deer is usually reported from habitat consisting of wet or moist tall grasslands, often associated with medium- to large-sized rivers (Bhowmik <em>et al</em>. 1999, Biswas and Mathur 2000, Biswas 2004), and appears to reach its highest densities in floodplain grasslands (Seidensticker 1976, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Karanth and Nichols 2000, Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). It avoids closed-canopy forest, but will use coastal grasslands (e.g., Peacock 1933). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered Hog Deer to be an obligate grassland species in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, and studies in India and Nepal have shown a preference for grasslands dominated by <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;(Biswas 2004 and references therein). Similar alluvial floodplain grassland seems to be used in Thailand and Indochina (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Clark undated, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). In Bardia National Park, measured densities were much higher in the floodplain association than in the riverine association, and no Hog Deer was found in adjacent Sal <em>Shorea robusta</em> forest at all (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the hilly areas of northeastern India, it occurs in small grassy areas, light woodland and abandoned <em>juhms</em>&#160;with grass (Choudhury 2013, A. Choudhury pers. comm 2014). The highest elevation where it has been recorder was 1,500 m asl in Nagaland (Choudhury 2013). These seem to be marginal habitats supporting only low-density subpopulations (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006): they may historically have been primarily ‘sink’ subpopulations. The remnant population in Bangladesh is located in grassy, lightly wooded, hill country (Khan 2004). In the southwestern coastal lowlands of Cambodia, where apparently the species was once common (Dumas 1944), the species appears to use an open habitat mosaic including brackish <em>Eleocharis</em>&#160;sedge marshes and&#160;‘upland’ tall <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;grasslands, and areas of scrubby open secondary woodland interspersed with&#160;‘dry’ short stature grasslands; cane-grass floodplain grasslands are essentially absent in this region (Timmins and Sechres 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The reintroduced semi-wild subpopulations in Thailand occupy a variety of habitats for which there is no evidence of use by wild subpopulations in Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam or Cambodia. One of the few detailed historical accounts of an abundant subpopulation in Southeast Asia was from extensive tall floodplain grasslands in the Dong Nai catchment, Viet Nam (Clark undated). Hog Deer is a primarily a grazer of young grasses, particularly <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> and <em>Saccharum</em> spp.; it also takes herbs, flowers, fruits and browse (young leaves and shoots of shrubs; Bhowmik <em>et al</em>. 1999, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Bisawas 2004, Wegge <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is much more a grazer and less a browser than is the Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>. Animals occur in scrub and cinnamon gardens in Sri Lanka, where they cause considerable damage to home crops (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992).<br/><br/>Where undisturbed, Hog Deer tend to be crepuscular, with significant day-time activity and some at night, especially in the hot and wet seasons (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In some areas it seems to have become more nocturnal and solitary (e.g., Cambodia; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), presumably through hunting pressure. The main social group is a female and fawn. When more Hog Deer are together, they do not form a strong ""unit"", fleeing when flushed in different directions rather than as one. In Chitwan, aggregations of up to 20 animals have been observed feeding on new shoots following fire (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In Kaziranga, aggregations of 40–80 animals are frequently seen on grazing grounds created by Great Indian Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em> and/or short grasslands near large water bodies (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008, based on observations in 1996). Home ranges vary widely in size, but average about five to 70 ha, depending on how the range is defined (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). In Chitwan, Hog Deer is essentially sedentary (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991), but in cultivated landscapes (Sri Lanka) movements are reported to be influenced by agricultural seasons (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992). Hog Deer moves into higher-lying grasslands in response to monsoon flooding in India, Myanmar and presumably throughout their range (Peacock 1933, Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). The rut is during September–October in Nepal and India and (presumably based on captives) during September–February in China. One to two fawns are born during April–May in Nepal and during April–October in China. Gestation period is 220–230 days (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993). Fawns wean at six months, reaching sexual maturity at eight to 12 months. The maximum recorded life span is 20 years.","Hog Deer is threatened by hunting and by habitat loss and degradation; much prime Hog Deer habitat had probably been converted well before the 20th century (e.g., Peacock 1933). The balance between these threats and their current severity varies somewhat between ‘South Asia’ (here comprising India, Nepal, presumably Bhutan and perhaps Pakistan) and ‘Southeast Asia’ (here comprising China, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh). In 2008 it was considered that there was insufficient information to judge for Myammar into which group it would fit however as of 2014 it is now clear that trends in habitats clearance, hunting pressure and conservation management in Myanmar are very similar to&#160;‘Southeast Asia’ especially Cambodia. Sri Lanka and Australia are considered outside the native range so not covered in detail here.<br/><br/>In the Mekong countries of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam and also probably China and Bangladesh, hunting has been, and remains, the primary direct threat to the species. In addition to local consumption of meat, the main factor presently driving such hunting is the thriving and probably increasing national, regional and East Asian markets trade in bushmeat, abetted by markets for traditional medicinal products derived from deer species and for trophy antlers (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007). It is also possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive animals, especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), although as of 2014 this is almost certainly insignificant (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer (e.g. Peacock 1933, Dumas 1944), and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during excursions, however, brief, outside farm and residential land, even if these are not for hunting (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting itself has been greatly augmented by habitat loss: the vast majority of tall floodplain grasslands have been lost in the region due to the suitability of such habitat for human settlement and agriculture, and only very small patches remain. This huge extent of habitat loss probably occurred largely after Hog Deer had been hunted down to negligible numbers (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The coastal lowland open habitat mosaic of southwestern Cambodia in contrast remained extensive and relatively little changed even in 2008, however development pressure in the area has increased enormously in the intervening years, with considerable developments of agricultural and agroforestry plantations (Timmins and Sechrest 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Given these threats, which are ongoing, Hog Deer is one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina (Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most significant challenge to conserving the species there is the uncertainty involved with long term protected area-based conservation management. As of the end of 2014 there are still no specific conservation measures for the species in Cambodia; none of the known subpopulations occur substantially within a protected area and given hunting pressure and trends in habitat loss, these subpopulations are highly likely to be extirpated in the short to medium term (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/>Even in South Asia, where many protected areas are effective in conserving populations of large ungulates, Hog Deer declined precipitously in the 20th century through habitat loss and hunting. It is still in decline even within some protected areas (e.g. Bhowmik 2002; see below). In India, habitat loss to cultivation has greatly reduced the area available to Hog Deer, and has continued to do so outside protected areas even in recent decades (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) stated that high levels of malaria had previously discouraged settlement, agriculture, and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape, and that the conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India, with a] population growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile Terai plains have been taken over by agriculture"". Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) stated that controlling disturbance to Lagga Bagga forest block in Pilibhit Forest Division (now within a tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008) is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder, and that intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area. Such a threat profile is typical of areas supporting Hog Deer. Outside protected areas, some Hog Deer remain in woodland areas where densities are very low, and although animals do appear to breed in such situations, it is unclear in the absence of adjacent high-density river plains populations how viable such woodland populations will be in the long term (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). Protected areas are encroached for cultivation and even more so for livestock grazing, which is surely increasing pressure on Hog Deer along with many other species. As a grazing species, Hog Deer numbers are likely to be severely depressed by competition with domestic livestock (by analogy with other wild ruminants, as detailed by Madhusudan 2004), although no data were traced on this. Domestic stock are ubiquitous in all areas outside the protected area network and even occur in many within it, specifically at least: Chitwan; Orang; Jaldapara; and Gorumara (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, R.H. Emslie pers. comm., B.N. Talukdar pers. comm., S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Most subpopulations in India are under severe threat from hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), although the largest subpopulation of the species, in Kaziranga, has been secured from this threat for many years. Poaching occurs in protected areas throughout the Indian range, especially in north Bengal, and can be associated with other human uses of protected areas perceived to be more legitimate, such as grazing camps (Biswas 2004). Many old skulls of Hog Deer were found across Arunachal Pradesh and Assam during the survey of Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002). On average two to three skulls were recorded from most houses in villages randomly visited during the survey in Arunachal Pradesh. Regularly, shots were heard and machans (tree-houses made for poaching) were found during the surveys in Nameri National Park, Sonai-Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary and Namdapha Tiger Reserve. According to questionnaire, 52% of responses reported high incidence of Hog Deer hunting in neighbouring areas. Hunting was reported as the primary reason for the sudden decline of the Hog Deer population from north Bengal since 1877. Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002) detailed evidence of Hog Deer hunting during the survey and past records from the district of Cooch Behar (West Bengal) back to the 18th century. Even today, in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park, there are still instances of deer poaching, and poaching has seriously depleted abundance of large mammals in most of the Terai Arc Landscape. Some poaching is driven by a desire to seek adventure, the thrill of shikar and wild meat, some by crushing poverty of daily wage labourers and others, some to take advantage of the business opportunity of supplying a lucrative trade. Poaching is done with dogs, snares, spears and guns (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Outside protected areas in India, enforcement of anti-hunting regulations is patchy and, unless there is effective specific intervention, all Hog Deer subpopulations in such areas will become extirpated in the near future from hunting (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer avidly eats rice and so in the past was “destroyed ruthlessly on such grounds” (Peacock 1933). It seems unlikely that killing Hog Deer solely for reduction of crop damage is nowadays a reason for population decline, although it may be a convenient excuse to kill deer. Most serious is that the predilection of Hog Deer to eat rice is likely to bring them into closer contact with people and therefore to increase easy opportunities for hunting. In Kratie, Cambodia, Hog Deer occur near, and seasonally forage in, rice fields, especially in the early rainy season. People set traps for wild pigs <em>Sus</em> species, which are more abundant than Hog Deer, and the traps sometimes kill Hog Deer. The local people now are reportedly refraining from using indiscriminate traps in the Hog Deer area, but such cooperation is unlikely to continue forever, because crop predation by pigs is really a problem (A. Maxwell pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In today’s highly fragmented subpopulations which have limited dispersal possibility, flooding may take heavy tolls, especially in the Brahmaputra flood plain (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). In Kaziranga National Park, where the largest subpopulation of this species is found, flooding is likely to be a major threat: in 1998 the flood reduced the subpopulation to less than half its pre-flood number (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). High floods both lead to drowning as animals are washed away also falling victim to road kill (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). The situation is similar in Nepal where Hog Deer appears to be especially vulnerable because of the short-grass habitats it usually uses during flood season, and in protected area like Koshi Tappu, flooding probably causes wide fluctuations in population numbers (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer subpopulations appear to rebound quickly even from heavy losses, but the fragmentation and increasing isolation of subpopulations into small areas, sometimes with no linkage to suitable higher ground, makes periodic losses from flooding a high risk for future site-level extinctions. Flooding is also a danger because, except in areas of effective anti-poaching activity, by marooning Hog Deer on little patches of high ground it makes them more easy to hunt (Peacock 1933).<br/><br/>A further threat also reflects the colossal habitat fragmentation in recent centuries. Prime Hog Deer habitats are naturally dynamic, and on a living floodplain new areas of grasslands are constantly created through natural processes to replace those changing through natural succession to woody vegetation; creation occurs through traumatic change of floodplain stream and land layout during spates (Dinerstein 1979, Lehmkuhl 1994, Peet <em>et al</em>. 1999). This is incompatible with farming and other human land-uses, which seek a predictable landscape. Hence, within Hog Deer range, there are very few active natural floodplains in which pre-exploitation processes shape the landscape in this way. Thus, the grasslands which are the prime habitat of Hog Deer generally require active management. In some protected areas grasslands are being lost by succession of wooded habitats, for example Chitwan (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006) and Bardia (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). By contrast, annual burning in Kaziranga, while maintaining a grass habitat, has rapidly changed the grassland structure and composition and how this change affects Hog Deer subpopulations is not known (S. Deb Roy pers. comm. 1996). In Nepal there is also succession of different grassland types and in particular <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> grasslands, which Hog Deer appears to favour at certain times of the year (Biswas 2004), are being replaced by larger cane grasses (H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Locally, conservation management of grasslands to benefit rhinoceroses, for instance in Jaldapara, might negatively affect Hog Deer (Biswas 2004 and references within).<br/><br/>The invasive creeper <em>Mikania</em> sp. threatens Hog Deer’s favoured grasslands both within and outside protected areas, and after flooding and poaching is possibly the next most serious threat to the species in Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). In combination with invasion by <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (=<em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), heavy livestock grazing pressure and invasion of some grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>, the grassland area in Chitwan has been reduced from 20% to 4.7% of the national park (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.). <em>Mikania</em> sp. are also carpeting large areas of non-forest habitats in the Hukaung Valley, Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camara</em> is also displacing native plants widely, and in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, the creeper <em>Tiliacora acuminata</em> is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Assam an invasive <em>Mimosa</em> sp. threatens the habitat in sites like Kaziranga and Orang National Parks, whereas in Manas National Park an invasive <em>Lea</em> sp. has become a major threat to the grassland habitat of the hog deer (B. Talukdar pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Floodplain grasslands are strongly affected in their pace of natural succession by water flows and levels, and seasonal patterns in them. Hydropower development changes these parameters and thus threatens habitat, including a project under consideration across the Mekong which would affect the sole known subpopulation of <em>A. p. annamiticus</em> (that in Cambodia), and another across the Karnali river which would modify habitats in Bardia, Nepal (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). There have been proposals to dam the Brahmaputra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen, this could very negatively affect the habitat quality and Hog Deer carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods, as well as changes in water levels and flows). In Jaldapara Sanctuary, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in the sanctuary is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Disease epidemics spreading from domestic livestock presumably pose a threat, especially given the close overlap of Hog Deer and domestic livestock in South Asia, the high densities especially of the latter, and the small and localised nature of Hog Deer subpopulations.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka the continued survival of the introduced subpopulations depends on controlling hunting and maintaining traditional agricultural land use practices. The land is too intensively cultivated for the establishment of protected areas within the range of the species. Threats in the rest of the introduced range are not reviewed here.","<em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pakistan</em><br/>Hog Deer is confined to isolated riverine grasslands along the Indus valley and its upper tributaries, mostly in the Indus River forest reserves of Sind Province, with small subpopulations around the Indus mouth and to the north of Sukkur (Roberts 1977). The species was listed for the protected areas of Chashma Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, Head Islam/Chak Kotora Game Reserve (greatly reduced in number), Lal Suhanra National Park (reintroduced), Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary, and possibly Rasool Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary (WCMC 1992), but no information more recent than Whale (1996) has been traced.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</em><br/>Hog Deer is found mainly in the Terai grasslands along the Himalayan foothills and the flood-plains of the Rivers Ganges and Brahmaputra, from Punjab in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east (Tandon 1989, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, Biswas 2004). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004), who made extensive surveys of the Terai Arc Landscape of India (for Tiger,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Panthera tigris,</span>&#160;and various prey species), considered that Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is excellent habitat for Hog Deer; that there was a reasonable subpopulation in Pilhibit Forest Division, particularly the Lagga Bagga forest block (now within a Tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008); that Kishanpur Wildife Sanctuary (203 km<sup>2</sup>), with one of the few remnants of Terai habitat in India, supported considerable numbers, and that Katarniaghat Wildife Division also held Hog Deer. Assessments conducted specifically for Hog Deer by Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002; see also Biswas 2004) for India surmised that populations remained in 29–34 areas, with significant numbers only in the following: Arunachal Pradesh: 100–200 in D’ering, and 20–50 in Namdapha; Assam: 20–50 in Dibrusaikhowa, over 1,000 in Kaziranga (but see below), over 1,000 in Manas, 20–50 in Nameiri, 200–500 in Orang, 20–50 in Kobuchapori, 20–50 in Burachapori, and 20–50 in Sunai Rupa; Bihar: 100–200 in Valmiki; Uttrakand (= Uttaranchal): 200–500 in Corbett Tiger Reserve (but see below); Uttar Pradesh: 1,000–2,000 in Dudhwa, 20–50 in Katarniaghat, 100–200 in Kishanpur, and 20–50 in North Kheri Forest Division; and West Bengal: 100–200 in Gorumara and a population at Jaldapara. Their estimate for Pilhibit Forest Division was zero, <em>contra</em> Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004). Biswas’s study also considered that Hog Deer had been lost from 35 historically known localities, and suggested it was ‘endangered’, with citations given for alarming decline even prior to the mid 1970s (Biswas 2004). The figures were not derived from rigorous sampling and some will surely need revision. Particularly, it is certain that there are over 10,000 Hog Deer in Kaziranga, with a best estimate of 14,000–16,000, at ecological densities of 38.6 (with SE 3.45) animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Karanth and Nicholls 2000, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008); and in Corbett Tiger Reserve, only about 100 were reported in 2008 by Bivash Pandav (pers. comm. 2008) and while the actual number is unclear, densities are now very low, even in prime habitat (K.M. Chinnappa and Praveen per N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and a rapid decline is in place (A. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Dudhwa Tiger Reserve also faces a suite of conservation problems meaning that population status of Hog Deer there is unlikely to be as healthy as in Kaziranga: poaching is rampant, and the creeper <em>Tiliacora acuminata</em>&#160;is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). At Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, where Biswas (1999) studied ecology of Hog Deer in the 1990s, sightings, and presumably populations, have now drastically declined (A.J.T. Johnsingh pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer is now primarily restricted to protected areas (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006), but south of Rajaji National Park there are a few isolated groups along the river (perhaps totalling about 100 animals); these are outside protected areas (B. Pandav pers. comm. 2008). All such subpopulations outside protected areas are in very rapid decline (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). The presence of this species in Manipur and southern Assam (close to Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura) is based on records in Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002); its current status there is unknown. All groups in these areas were estimated to be very small, and should not be assumed to persist. The more recent assessment by Choudhury (2013) indicated the following numbers in some key northeastern Indian reserves: Kaziranga (c. 10,000; marginal decline owing to high floods), Manas (c. 1,500; marginal increase since near extirpation in the 1989-1992 period), RG Orang (c. 500; all in Assam); Jaldapara (250+; marginal increase in recent years owing to improved protection, in Arunachal Pradesh); and Keibul Lamjao (c. 100) (in Manipur).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bangladesh</em><br/>Hog Deer has disappeared from the Sundarbans (Salter 1984) and has not been reported from the Sylhet District, in the northeast, since the 1970s (Khan 2004). After a long period with no records, an animal was trapped by local people in 2002 (Khan 2004). Further surveys suggested that a few Hog Deer remained in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of the southeast (Khan 2004, Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008). Camera trapping and observational surveys during 2010-2011 in Chittagong Hill Tracts did not detect Hog Deer, however the surveys did not cover the low hills and degraded forest areas in which the species would most likely be expected to occur (S. Chakma per.comm. 2014). There is a small captive population derived from native animals (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008). Within historic times, Hog Deer was never widespread in the country and pressure was on it from at least the 1970s (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nepal</em><br/>Hog Deer is locally abundant in the Terai, but is now restricted largely, if not entirely, to protected areas (P. Yonzon pers. comm. 2006, H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Although subpopulations may currently be relatively stable, declines in the past 20–30 years are likely to have exceeded 30% (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Measured densities range from 0.1 per km<sup>2</sup> in riverine forest, to 16.5 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in savanna, and 35 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in grassland flood-plains (Seidensticker 1976, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In Bardia National Park, densities of 77.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the floodplain association and 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the riverine association (and zero in Sal forest) were measured (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). The species occurs in the following protected areas: Parsa Wildlife Reserve (with a very small subpopulation), Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). Each of Suklaphanta, Bardia and Chitwan supports hundreds of Hog Deer. As of 2014, there has been no significant change in the population since 2008 (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bhutan</em><br/>The small Bhutan subpopulation is found mostly along the southern foothills and small plains along the rivers. Animals have been observed in three protected areas along its border with Assam India, these are Phipsoo, Royal Manas and Khaling. The number of individuals in Royal Manas National Park could be greater than 150, with the grassland around the Gabhorukunda river as the main stronghold (A. Choudhury, pers. comm 2014). It has also been recorder from Mochu Wildlife Reserve.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</em><br/>Hog Deer historically was recorded in southwest parts of Gengma and Cangyuan counties of Western Yunnan bordering Myanmar, and has recently been stated to be extinct in the country (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Smith and Xie Yan 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</em><br/>Hog Deer has long been known in Myanmar (e.g., Evans 1902) and occurred throughout the country wherever there were grassy plains (Peacock 1933). For the 2008 assessment detailed information on Hog Deer's current range or population status in Myanmar has not been traced. It was already in major decline by the time Peacock (1933) wrote. It was listed only for three protected areas by WCMC (1992): Pidaung, Kahilu, and Hlawga Wildlife Reserves. Of these, the Hlawga subpopulation of many dozen (in 2007) is a semi-captive, managed herd: the entire area, of several square kilometres, is fenced; however, it may be ‘native’ in that the founders were reputedly from animals captured locally during the 1980s (Saw Htoo Tha Po verbally 2007 to J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008)., but these have been added to over the years (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). As of 2014, there were still small numbers at Hlawga, but they appeared to be decreasing because of new management at the park and possibly hunting (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). The Pidaung Wildlife Sanctuary was set aside in 1918 to protect an unusual mix of evergreen forest and savanna-like ecosystems (Milton <em>et al</em>. 1964), and Hog Deer used to be very numerous within it (Peacock 1933); at this time it was the only site in the country where Hog Deer received a measure of protection. Today, the presence of permanent human settlements, roads and railway lines, plantations of sugar cane, military camps and permanent cultivation have completely altered large portions of the sanctuary, and an insignificant area of the original ecosystem remains (Rao <em>et al</em>. 2002). These land-uses are concentrated in the plains parts of the sanctuary, where Hog Deer used to live, and have converted so absolutely these areas that it is not obvious to someone driving along the road when the protected area is entered or exited (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visits in 2005-2006). People and dogs are ubiquitous and it seems implausible that any Hog Deer could survive here (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visits in 2005–2006). However park staff believe that a few animals still persist there (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). In 2010 and 2011 Hog Deer was confirmed by camera-trapping from Hukaung Valley in Kachin state (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014), following on from reports from hunters' and conservation staff between 2005-2007 (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). At the turn of the century suitable habitat was very extensive in the Hukaung Valley, but as of 2014 review of remote imagery suggests that there has been massive loss of riparian grasslands to make way for agriculture and other anthropogenic land uses (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hog deer are still present in a fairly large area of floodplain grasslands including areas along the Tanai (Upper Chindwin), Tawan and Mogaung streams. Much of the grasslands where hog deer area known are outside of the Wildlife Sanctuary but as awareness of the species is increasing, it appears they occur further inside the Wildlife Sanctuary than previously thought (R. Tizard pers. comm. 2014). An FFI survey team recorded Hog Deer in the grasslands between the boundary of Indawgyi WS and the forest in 2012 (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). Several government staff indicated in 2005-2007 that the species is still locally common in lowland Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Pidaung was seen as a flagship protected area (it was one of the country’s first), and its current status does not augur well for the few other protected areas which contain suitable Hog Deer habitat. Extensive camera-trapping for a Tiger survey found no evidence of the species (Lynam 2003), but this may simply have reflected the focus of the survey on closed evergreen forests (habitats unsuitable for Hog Deer), as various other species known to be common but not using closed evergreen forest were also camera-trapped rarely if at all (T. Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</em><br/>The species was formerly abundant in the Chao Phraya Basin during the early 20th century, but had become extinct there by the mid-1960s (Humphrey and Bain 1990). There was formerly a huge export trade, for example 20,000 skins went out of the Gulf of Siam (it is not stated whether this was from Thailand, Cambodia, or both) in 1930–1931 (Dumas 1944). There was a plea for conservation attention to the species in Thailand in Lekagul and McNeely (1977), but this seems to have come too late. Animals reportedly from Thailand and possibly Myanmar have been used to build up numerous managed herds in captive and semi-wild conditions across the country, although the origins of the managed herds remain uncertain. Such animals were introduced into Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station in northern Thailand in the early 1990s, at a higher elevation than is typical for the natural range of the species; this herd lives in open grassland around the edge of a reservoir (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). There is also an apparently large introduced subpopulation on the island of Ko Chang in the Gulf of Siam.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Lao PDR</em><br/>Hog Deer is probably extinct in Lao PDR and its past status is difficult to assess: there are few, if any, specimens held in international collections from the country, and there were no records (except of old trophies) during extensive surveys across the country in the 1990s (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, Osgood (1932) specifically cautioned that it was much under-represented in zoological collections, despite it being locally common in Indochina. The extent to which this statement includes Lao PDR is unknown. All potentially suitable habitat patches are now small in size and are heavily used by local people, hunting pressure in Lao PDR is high, and it is inconceivable in the great majority of areas that any Hog Deer could still persist (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). <br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Viet Nam</em><br/>Hog Deer is thought to be extinct in Viet Nam, having previously occurred in some large subpopulations in suitable habitat (e.g. Clark undated) and apparently having been widespread in the south according to reports in Ratajszczak (1991). This reflects the rapidity with which suitable habitat has been lost and the heavy hunting pressure on large mammals throughout much of Viet Nam (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Timmins and Duckworth 2000). If the species still occurs in Viet Nam, it is most likely to be along the Kon river in Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve, the western Srepok river lowlands of Dak Lak Province, the Sa Tay area of Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces, the Dong Nai river lowlands and Lam Dong Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). However, there is no recent evidence other than unconfirmed reports, and a trophy which may be of Hog Deer from the Kon Cha Rang NR area. Other evidence, notably high hunting rates of ungulates in general, suggest that even very small numbers are unlikely to survive (Dang Huy Huynh 1986, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006, 2014).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</em><br/>Hog Deer used to be abundant on the vast marshy plains of Cambodia, such as around Sre Ambel, in the province of Kratie, around Kompong Som, and around Kampot; in the drier regions of much of the north it was not common (Dumas 1944). Increased wildlife surveys from 1994 onwards failed to find Hog Deer anywhere in Cambodia until it was re-found in Kratie in 2006, following concerns it might already be extinct (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007). A few animals, probably in the low dozens, remain scattered in small groups in remnant areas of floodplain grasslands and other vegetation in Kratie Province (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008.). In 2008 the species was detected in grasslands and remained widespread (Timmins and Sechrest 2010). Potential habitat in the southwest was much greater in extent than in the Kratie floodplains suggesting that a much larger subpopulation of deer remained there at least at the turn of the century (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and the species was recorded from three additional sites in 2013 during focused surveys for the species (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Since 2008 however there has been no effective protection of any of the known subpopulations or of other areas of habitat with good potential for persistence; and coastal areas have in the intervening six years seen high rates of conversion especially to plantation agriculture and forestry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). All remaining subpopulations are likely to be small, possibly isolated from each other, and subject to hunting (Brook <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></em><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sri Lanka</em> (probably introduced)<br/>Hog Deer is restricted to largely cultivated landscapes within a 35 km<sup>2</sup> area, between Ambalangoda and Indurawa on the southwest coast, and inland as far as Elpitiya (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992, 1994). It does not occur in any protected area. Hog Deer is thought to have been introduced to Sri Lanka by the Dutch or the Portuguese in the 16th century, or possibly by a Sinhalese ruler in the pre-colonial period or the British later on; suggestions that it is native are doubted because of the absence of records across central and southern India (Biswas and Mathur 2000). Vishvanath <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) recommend genetic studies to further clarify the status of Sri Lanka's Hog Deer subpopulation.<br/><br/><strong><em>Australia</em>&#160;</strong>(introduced)<br/>All extant subpopulations of Hog Deer are on the South Coast of Victoria. There are two managed subpopulations at reserves on Sunday Island and at Blond Bay. Additionally, there are scattered groups on private land between Wilson's Promontory and Orbost. These subpopulations derive from releases made in 1865 (Scroggie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"Hog Deer historically occurred from Pakistan, throughout northern and northeastern India, including the Himalayan foothill zone, east across non-Sundaic Southeast Asia and, marginally, southern China (southern Yunnan province), but it is now reduced to isolated subpopulations within this range. It is almost extirpated from east of Myanmar. It is extinct in Thailand (where it has, however, been reintroduced) and almost certainly in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (Humphrey and Bain 1990, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Very small numbers have been found recently in Bangladesh and in five areas in Cambodia (Khan 2004, Maxwell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007, Timmings and Sechrest 2010, Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). A report on the internet in 2007 from China turned out to refer to a young Sambar (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2012).  Hog Deer still probably occurs in at least several areas of Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008, from various sources), and localised subpopulations survive in northern and northeastern India, Nepal, Bhutan (few recent data) and Pakistan (status uncertain; Biswas and Mathur 2000, Biswas 2004). Hog Deer has been introduced (not mapped) into Australia (specifically the coastal regions of south and east Gippsland; Moore and Mayze 1990), the United States (Texas, Florida and Hawaii; Grubb 2005) and it is presumed introduced into Sri Lanka; however there remains some discussion as to whether the species is native or introduced into Sri Lanka (Vishvanath <em>et al</em>. 2014) so the species is retained here as non-native until definitive information is received.","Hog Deer is hunted in various parts of its range. It is hunted for its meat (bushmeat trade), traditional  medicinal products and for trophy antlers. It is also  possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive  animals.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Hog Deer is fully protected in Bangladesh, India, and probably most or all other range states. One subspecies is listed on CITES Appendix I as<em> Axis porcinus annamiticus</em><em></em>.<br/><br/>Wetlands, especially floodplain grasslands, have traditionally been ignored by the protected area systems and other conservation initiatives of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). Most of the area supporting the single known subpopulation in Cambodia has been proposed for protected area status, but the situation is complicated by the inclusion of agricultural lands and traditional use areas of local people, and the high human population immediately nearby (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008); as of 2014 no protected status has been granted to this area (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). As soon as the subpopulation was found, a small conservation programme with external funding from WWF was started to support a small number of forestry rangers and local guardians to carry out patrolling and community outreach activities, in addition to basic research. These measures ceased due to a combination of factors including lack of funding and motivation in part brought on by the failure to establish the site as as protected area in c. 2008 (R.J. Timmins pers. comm 2014), but may be re-established by WWF with the Forestry Administration (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Probably the bulk of the southwest Cambodian subpopulation lies outside of protected areas, although there was marginal inclusion within one protected area Botum Sakor National Park and the proposed Southwest Elephant Corridor, with confirmed occurrence near to the Dong Peng Multiple Use Area. However, in all of these areas deer are in peripheral areas, while conservation attention, is focused on extensive forest at their heart (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In 2013 a national action plan was developed for the conservation of Hog Deer in Indochina. The plan recommends securing the Kratie subpopulation and one of the Southwest subpopulations (Andoung Teuk) thourgh establishing anti-poaching patrols, engaging local communities in the conservation oh Hog Deer, stabilizing land-use and formalizing protection for the sites. It also recommends the establishment of a conservation breeding programme for the species from ideally to other known small and isolated subpopulations in the Southwest (Forestry Administration, 2014). The plan has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. To ensure protection and survival of animals, consideration should be given as to whether it would be useful for part of the areas to be strategically fenced to help deter poaching, agricultural encroachment and predation by dogs; but this would need to consider seasonal movements.<br/><br/>There are few areas in Viet Nam where suitable habitat is thought to remain, but if reasonable extents of alluvial grassland survive in the following areas surveys for Hog Deer may be warranted: Cat Tien National Park, the Kon river in the Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve area, and the Sa Tay area of Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces; although given the high hunting pressure in Viet Nam it is becoming very unlikely that any animals could still survive (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Cat Tien National Park retains significant areas of alluvial grasslands, and could potentially in the future become a site for reintroduction, however park management appears to be to some extent ignorant of the importance of these grasslands with ongoing schemes to re-establish forest and a fire management policy that is probably leading to woody encroachment of grasslands (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014, based on a visit in December 2013).<br/><br/>It is not certain what conservation measures are in place (if any) for the rediscovered subpopulation in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>There has been no comprehensive assessment of Hog Deer in Myanmar, but it probably exists mostly in unprotected plains grassland areas which, as in the Mekong countries, are conventionally seen as of low conservation value (Peacock 1933, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). In 2010 an 11,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;extension of the Hukaung valley was established. Hog Deer were camera-trapped in three localities in the grasslands along the Tawang River; one in the core area and the other two on the edge of the core area and the extension. In the last two years (since 2012) this area has seen the development of human settlements and agricultural expansion (Than Zaw pers. comm.) resulting in considerable loss of grassland habitat (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). A clarification of the status of Hog Deer in Myanmar is urgent: there may yet remain areas supporting animals which have high conservation potential if they do not disappear before being known to conservation. This lack of conservation profile is the chief challenge to Hog Deer in Myanmar at the moment, as it was in Peacock’s (1933) day: “the butchery of these little deer and the failure to provide more than one small sanctuary for their preservation is certainly one of the weak spots in Myanmar game legislation...the existing legislation is singularly ineffective in preventing their wholesale destruction. Moreover, there are few forest reserves which are suitable for the Hog Deer, and the legislation concerned with such forests is little more than a gesture”. If not met head-on, there are no grounds to assume that Hog Deer national conservation status will not replicate that shown by all range states to the east (major population collapse), if indeed it has not already done so.<br/><br/>Most Hog Deer subpopulations remaining in India, Nepal and Bhutan are in protected areas where animals are at least somewhat, and in some cases well, protected from poaching (Biswas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Biswas 2004, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pralad Yonzon pers. comm. 2006, H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008, A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Wildlife protection laws in India have also helped in retaining the specialized habitat of Hog Deer, arresting habitat loss and habitat conversion in some protected areas. Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) found a strong correlation with Hog Deer subpopulations and protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (similar to that for Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>), in contrast to other deer which occur relatively widely outside protected areas. Some protected areas are not big enough to allow adequate ranging during heavy flood periods, and thus prevent heavy mortality during such periods, and all suffer from being too small to be allowed unfettered habitat succession, because new grasslands are not now being created by natural processes elsewhere (see Habitat and ecology). In India and Nepal, Hog Deer has benefited from conservation measures taken for Great Indian Rhinoceros and Barasingha in the same wet grassland habitats (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995, Biswas 2004). However, grassland management for rhinoceros may in some cases be deleterious to Hog Deer (Biswas 2004).<br/><br/>In South Asia there is an urgent need to update the status review of Biswas and Mathur (2000), even though some large Hog Deer subpopulations inhabit some of the best-secured protected areas in the world. Even assuming that these protected areas continue to receive sufficient material and political support, such a review is necessary because all subpopulations face uncertain futures from a multitude of factors, some of which originate outside protected areas and beyond the zone of influence of protected area managers. The review needs to determine roughly the numbers remaining and the locations of all sizeable or potentially sizeable subpopulations, and especially for each make assessments of current and likely future conservation status and population trends, bearing in mind threats from poaching, agricultural encroachment, livestock grazing, natural habitat succession, perverse habitat management, invasive plant species, the risk of disease epidemics from domestic livestock, changes to water levels and flows (e.g. from upstream dams), further fragmentation of subpopulations and habitats, episodic mortality through flooding and abiotic risks such as insurgency (which can collapse protected area management, although it does not always do so). Confinement of subpopulations to small habitat patches isolated from other such patches raises the intrinsic threat of subpopulation loss significantly when considering the wide gamut of threats facing such subpopulations (Biswas and Singh 2002, Biswas 2004), and in some sites challenges may be so pervasive that long-term retention of Hog Deer subpopulations may be so difficult as to be an inefficient use of resources. An integrated South Asia-wide conservation plan may be the best route to direct resources to a representative set of areas where long-term persistence of large Hog Deer subpopulations can be assured provided sufficient resources are mobilised and deployed in the appropriate way. <br/><br/>By contrast, in Southeast Asia, any subpopulation found east of central Thailand (i.e. within the historical range of <em>A. p. annamiticus</em>, the western limit of which is not clear) warrants immediate attention. It is plausible that the recently found small and fragile subpopulation in Cambodia is the last stock of this taxon. The isolated small subpopulations in Bangladesh, although presumably of the nominate race, warrant priority protection in maintaining the ancestral geographic and habitat range of Hog Deer.  Species-specific intervention in Myanmar should probably, given the great challenges in the country (and, specifically, the uneven success to date with Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> conservation), be fitted within larger initiatives such as conservation of the Hukaung Valley, probably the largest floodplain in tropical Asia retaining largely natural ecological processes of stream geography and habitat dynamics.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, where the species is restricted to privately-owned gardens, its survival depends on the goodwill of the landowners. The conservation value of this introduced subpopulation needs re-evaluation, considering approximate size, recent trend, ecological integrity and any genetic uniqueness, balanced against the likely cost of conservation interventions to secure the subpopulation’s future. Needs of other introduced subpopulations are not considered here.<br/><br/>There is a large total of animals in zoos of tropical Asia. Although at least one Mekong animal appeared in a zoo recently (in Cambodia in the mid 1990s, C.M. Poole pers. comm. 1998), so far as is known, all captive herds are derived from subpopulations from Thailand and Myanmar and further west.

Although it is still declining in some sites (particularly outside protected areas), at the species level any such declines are at nowhere near the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. Historical declines may have been higher, but these occurred outside of the three generation window (&lt;30 years) used for purposes of applying Red List Criteria. Listing as Least Concern recognizes that there are two significant conservation issues with this species. Firstly, current densities are mostly well below what the habitat could support (and have been for decades), and secondly, the long-term persistence of nearly all subpopulations is dependent upon well secured protected areas: anything which caused the breakdown of current effective protection would allow a rapid rise in hunting levels and perhaps of domestic stock-grazing. These are the factors with which current Chital numbers are in an uneasy and fragile relationship. If such changes were to occur across a significant part of the range, reassessment of Red List status would be required: without effective protection, Chital’s population trend would emulate that of Eld's Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em>, another herding deer of rather open forests, but with a geographic range covering areas without long-standing effective protected areas. Regular monitoring of the status of Chital subpopulations would be prudent for this species.","Chital thrive in a variety of habitats, but avoid extremes such as dense moist (evergreen) forests and open semi-desert or desert. Moist and dry deciduous forest areas, especially adjoining dry thorn scrub or grasslands, appear to be optimal, and highest densities of Chital are reported from these habitats. Short grasslands of the terai, swampy meadows and glades adjoining forest areas, coastal dry evergreen forests, mixed forests or plantations with Teak Tectona grandis and Sal Shorea robusta are also used, and indeed over much of northern and southern India, its distribution closely matches that of Sal and Teak, respectively (Raman 2013). Chital is particularly frequent in grassland–forest interface, edge, and other ecotones (Krishnan 1972). Eisenberg and Seidensticker (1976) opined that dry deciduous habitats with scrub is the favoured habitat, while Karanth and Sunquist (1992) found mixed forests with teak plantations, moist deciduous patches and swampy grasslands to support high abundance of Chital. Kumar (2010) found that well-watered and well-protected moist deciduous forest patches in gently undulating terrain supported high Chital densities. Short grasslands are important because they provide little cover for predators such as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (Moe and Wegge 1994). The introduced subpopulation in Andaman Islands inhabits evergreen forests (Sankar and Acharya 2004) but native subpopulations are absent from the rainforest areas of the mainland. They tend to be only visitors to dense forests, to those adjoining more open habitats. Riverine forests within the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal are highly used by the deer for shade and cover during the dry season. The forest also provides good foraging with regard to fallen fruit and leaves that are high in nutrients needed by the deer. Four factors were identified by Schaller (1967) as delineating Chital’s distribution: (1) the need for water; (2) the need for shade; (3) an avoidance of high, rugged terrain; and (4) a preference for grass as forage. Although several observers have noted that Chital occurs mostly in flat areas and avoids hills and slopes (Schaller 1967, Khan 1996), this may not hold in areas where preferred habitats or forage is also available on slopes (Raman 2013, Kumar 2010). It occurs in both hilly and flatter terrain, mainly the latter, in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Siwalik hills, Bhat and Rawat (1995) found that Chital preferred slopes of 11–30°, while slopes exceeding 30° were used less. Also, use of south, southeast, and east aspects was higher than of north, northeast, northwest, and west aspects, reflecting the warmer environment of the former aspects. There was no difference in average Chital density in the hills and plains (Bhat and Rawat 1995). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Chital widely, including in coffee areas up to 14 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat use varies seasonally, reflecting food availability. Chital uses more wooded habitat during the cool-dry season and early summer (November to May), where fallen fruit, leaf litter, and browse are available. In open grassland and tropical dry thorn forest, Chital density increases with the onset of monsoon rains and flush of plant growth (Mishra 1982, Moe and Wegge 1994, Khan 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). In areas of their distribution with a mosaic of forest and grassland habitats, seasonal patterns in habitat use may be complex. In the Himalayan terai, Chital use of habitats with high grass availability increased substantially in the weeks following cutting and burning of grasses in January–February, attributed to fresh flush of grass growth after the burns and with the onset pre-monsoon and monsoon rains nearly two months later (Mishra 1982; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997). Similar behaviour has been reported from the grasslands of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh 1983).<br/><br/>Chital easily habituates to human presence, and herds often congregate in open areas near habitation or forest camps to spend the night, possibly due to greater safety from predators and poachers that shy away from these areas (Raman 2013).<br/><br/>Chital eats a wide variety of plants: about 160–190 have been recorded from across the species' range. It is predominantly a grazer but consumes more fallen leaves, flowers and fruits in winter/dry season (Sankar 1994, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Raman 2013). In addition to plant soft matter, crabs (in the Sunderbans; Stanford 1951), mushrooms (in Nepal; Moe and Wegge 1994) and rarely, bark (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996) are eaten. Close to human habitation, rubbish and even human faeces are occasionally taken (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Antler and bone chewing is also common. In Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, all age and sex classes are osteophagous, but such feeding was more common in velvet-antlered males, doubtless reflecting mineral needs during antler growth and mineralisation (Barrette 1985). Chital usually drinks water once a day, more frequently in summer. This restricts them to forest tracts with assured presence of water, even if only widely scattered.<br/><br/>In lowland Nepal, an individual’s total range incorporates a core area of about 32 hectares surrounded by foraging and cover areas of about 140 ha for females and 195 ha for males (Moe and Wegge 1994). Variation in range size occurs with site, season, sex and age of the animal. The basic social unit is a matriarchal family group, normally consisting of an adult female, her offspring from the previous year, and a fawn (Ables 1974). The usual herd is composed of two or more such family units and is often accompanied by individual deer of mixed sex and age-classes. Chital exhibits a fission-fusion system, or fluid group formation and dissolution (Schaller 1967, Mishra 1982, Barette 1991). Group composition changes frequently during feeding periods, during the rut when males frequently join groups of females (Schaller 1967), and while fleeing from predators (Dinerstein 1980). These social groupings of Chital do not remain permanent (Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972). Groups may number up to 150 or more individuals (De and Spillit 1966, Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Krishnan 1972, Fuchs 1977, Karanth and Sunquist 1992), sometimes even more: N.S. Kumar (pers. comm. 2008) counted 211 in one group during rainy season in Nagarahole and 203 in one group at Pench-Maharashtra near a water reservoir in summer. Measured sex ratios have all been biased towards females (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Pariwakam (2006) observed nearly 10,500 Chital in Bandipur and estimated the proportion of Chital in different age and sex classes as stags 27%, does 57% and fawns 16%. In neighbouring Nagarahole, age-sex categories of Chital were adult stags 26%, adult does 36%, yearling males 8%, yearling females 9% and young 21% (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). Breeding can occur at any time of year but there is some peaking at any given locality (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Heavy mortality of fawns in early weeks has been observed by several workers and fawn survival appears to be a key determinant of Chital population growth (Schaller 1967). Schaller (1967) estimated an annual fawn mortality of 48% in Kanha, Sharathchandra, and Gadgil (1975) estimated a constant monthly mortality of 26% over first nine months in Bandipur, Raman (1996) estimated a mean monthly mortality of 9.7% in Guindy. Pariwakam (2006) for the first time used a rigorous photographic capture-recapture approach to estimate the fawn mortality rate, and found it to be 66% over a six week study period in Bandipur. Further information on sociality and breeding is synthesised by Sankar and Acharya (2004) and by Raman (2013). Over a 10-year time period, Karanth and Kumar (unpublished data) have observed annual fluctuations in the Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole and Bandipur ranging between population densities of 10 to 40 animals per km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Chital is a prolific breeder, as documented by several empirical studies of the speed of increase by newly introduced subpopulations or in those where a factor restraining subpopulations was removed (Raman 2013 and references therein). In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole. This and its diverse diet and habitats allow high density where threats are controlled. It is even considered to be a pest in the Andamans (Banerji 1955).<br/><br/>The main causes of death are predation, diseases and accidents. Occasionally, stags kill each other when fighting (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Predation is by far the major cause of Chital mortality. Older Chital stags are more susceptible to it than are younger stags (Johnsingh 1983, Patel 1992, Karanth and Sunquist 1995). This may be due to their being less vigilant during rut, to their separation from the group after the rut, or to weakening from injuries from conflicts. In Kanha, Chital remains were found in about 52% of Tiger faeces and 59% of Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> faeces analysed (Schaller 1967). In Bandipur, Chital is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Dhole (78%), Leopard (55%) and Tiger (19%; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even in terms of the relative number of individuals taken, Chital is the predominant prey among the three large sympatric predators (Tigers about 33%, Leopards about 39% and Dholes about 73% in Bandipur; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole remains were found in about 31% of Tiger faeces, 44% of Leopard faeces, and 50% of Dhole faeces (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Sariska, around 54% of the faeces of Tiger and 21% of Leopard faeces contained Chital remains (Sankar 1994). Chital remains were found in about 53% of Tiger faeces in Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002) and 61% of Tiger faeces in Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Each Chital spends a major portion of its life in foraging, resting, and wandering within its range, with the relative extent of these activities determined by season (Schaller 1967). In a day, peak feeding times are around dawn and dusk. There are usually two major resting periods, before dawn and mid-day (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Considerable further detail on ecology, drawn from the relative wealth of studies on the species, with each item precisely referenced to source, is provided by Raman (2013).","There are presently no major global-level threats to Chital, although densities are widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock. There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000,&#160;Madhusudan and Karanth&#160;2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.<br/><br/>The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.<br/><br/>Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (= <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Chital declined drastically throughout its range up until the first two-thirds of the 20th century (see under Major Threats). Karanth<em> et al. </em>(2010) documented an estimated average extinction rate of 45% over the last 50 years in the Indian sub-continent. It is however ""locally"" abundant in well protected parts of its range in mixes deciduous habitats. In India it occurs in 123 protected areas and forest tracts (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India in Sankar and Acharya 2004). There are some large subpopulations in Nepal (e.g. Moe and Wegge 1994) where the population is probably currently stable and is anticipated to remain so in the immediate future (Hem Sagar Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Thousands survive in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh, and there are a few introducedsub populations on coastal islands in the south (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The reported ecological densities of Chital mostly fall within three to 50 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 4.51 +/- 1.05 (SE) per&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 51.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 49.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 50.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 20.1 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.2 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 38.4 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); BRT mixed deciduous forest, 9.4 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Dandeli-Anshi mix of evergreen and deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Panna dry deciduous forest, 10.2 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Chundawat and Karanth unpublished data); Kawal dry deciduous forset two animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Siddique 2010),&#160;and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some parts of the well-protected areas in Nagarahole and Bandipur are known to harbour densities as high as 80–100 Chital per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2010). Humar (2010) observed high spatial variation in the abundance of Chital in the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Nagarahole-Bandipur National Parks, which ranged between zero to 100 animals per km<sup>2</sup>. Kumar (2010) also found that Chital densities positively responded to higher levels of protection, forage quality, flat terrain and water availability.&#160;The highest population densities, of around 200 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, are reported for the Bardia National Park, Nepal (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994) and for the reintroducedsub population in Guindy National Park, southern India (Menon 1982, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). These high densities reflect habitat and food availability in the former area (Moe and Wegge 1994), and supplementary feeding and low predation in the latter (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Population densities in marginal habitats tend to be lower (Raman 2013; K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Chital is the most abundant ungulate in Nagarahole, and reaches higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and livestock grazing (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site. This found respective densities of 65 and 10 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>The Chital is almost completely dependent on active protection. Were this to be removed, the species' status in the 1970s suggests that rapid declines would occur. Even now, a very large proportion of its range supports subpopulations at significantly lower densities than the habitat could support.<br/><br/>The only subpopulation in Europe is on the islands of Brijuni (off Istria, Croatia), but B. Krystufek (pers. comm. 2008) has traced no information on its current status. Information has not been sought for this account on introduced subpopulations elsewhere, because they do not contribute to assessing the species’ Red List status.",Unknown,"The Chital occurs over 8–30°N in India (including Sikkim), Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). The western distribution boundary is formed by eastern Rajasthan (e.g. Sariska, Ranthambore and Keoladeo Ghana) and Gujarat (e.g. Sasan Gir). The northern boundary runs along the bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan below 1,100 m asl. The eastern boundary runs through western Assam (Golapara and Kamrup district as far east as the Dhunsiri River in Darrang district) to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit (Gee 1964, Schaller 1967, Raman 2013). Chital occur throughout the rest of peninsular India sporadically in the forested areas (Sankar and Acharya 2004), but in Bangladesh, it now occurs only in the Sundarbans, having vanished from the central, northeast and southeast regions (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>Chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands (India, during 1925–1930; Banerji 1955), Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Croatia (islands of Brijuni; Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999), Moldova, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Uruguay and the USA (California, Florida, Hawaiian Islands and Texas; Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). These introduced subpopulations have not been mapped. Not all introductions have succeeded: for example, some were introduced to west-central Slovenia (from the Brijuni islands) in the late 1940s or in 1950, but this introduction failed and is now therefore frequently reported as having been of Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>. One male, shot on 12 October 1950 and now in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, proves the identification (Krystufek 1999). Managed herds occur in parks throughout the native and introduced range and in many other areas.","Chital are hunted for food, sport, and a variety of other purposes. It is unclear as to the numbers of captive animals kept within the native range and even if such animals are used to supply the same markets as wild caught animals. Introduced subpopulations almost certainly do not supply the same markets as wild caught animals from the species native range.",Terrestrial,"Chital is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It occurs in many protected areas. Legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas are the two cornerstones of its current healthy conservation status. Subpopulations exceeding 20,000 Chital probably occur in and around a handful of conservation areas within India: the belt of about 3,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;between Koh river and Haldwani including the Corbett Tiger Reserve; the Gir Protected Area (about 1,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); Kanha Tiger Reserve (about 2,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); and the Nilgiris–Western Ghats sector including Nagarahole, Bandipur, and Mudumalai (about 5,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Raman 2013). Protected areas support more Chitals than do non-protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, although there is not currently such a great difference in densities as with the grassland species (Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em>;<em>&#160;</em>Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Ongoing habitat conversion trends outside protected areas will continue to increase the relative proportion of the total Chital population that they hold, and the maintenance of an extensive network of functional protected areas will remain the foundation of this species’ healthy conservation status. Part of this responsibility is vigilance by staff and partners of illegal poaching, which takes place at varying levels in most of the species range. Some recent cases have involved high-profile public role models, such as actors, poaching Chital and these warrant heavy court penalties. There is a strong case for prevention of livestock grazing in protected areas which hold Chital, partly to reduce risks of disease transmission, but mostly to prevent artificially low densities of Chital being forced through competition (see Threat Section).<br/><br/>Chital subpopulations have been studied in: Corbett (De and Spillit 1966), Kanha (Schaller 1967), Bandipur (Johnsingh 1983, Kumar 2010), Nagarahole (Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Kumar 2010), Sariska (Sankar 1994), Gir (Khan <em>et al</em>. 1995, 1996), Guindy (Raman 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996), Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002), Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003) in India, Chitwan (Seidensticker 1976, Mishra 1982) and Karnali-Bardia (Dinerstein 1980; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997) in Nepal, and Wilpattu (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) in Sri Lanka.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Data). Therefore, the total population estimate for the species would be between 16,650-23,000 individuals. Based on population structure data from Perú (74% adults, Barrio 2007), Bolivia (69% adults, Rumiz <em>et al.</em> 2010) and Chile (81% adults, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), we may infer that about 75% are adult individuals (11,800-15,750 adult individuals). However, it would not be wise to believe that all adult individuals are reproducing, since effective population sizes for wildlife may average 0.11 of total population size (Frankham 1995). There are no single estimate of effective population sizes for Tarukas, but there is a recent one for guanacos (Sarno <em>et al.</em> 2015). These authors indicate that the relationship between effective population size to census population size range from 0.04 to 0.99, but decreased to 0.24 when only potentially breeding adults are considered. Therefore, if we believe that effective population size is 25% on census population size, then we may be under a conservative scenario of 4,162-5,750 mature breeding Tarukas.<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is also a serious threat to the existing subpopulations, especially near human settlements (Rechberger <em>et al.</em> 2014, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011). Additionally, although there are no single monitoring programs at the regional level, there is a widely shared expert opinion of a perceived continuing decline in a large portion of the species range (Argentine, Chile and Bolivia, Barrio and Ferreyra 2008, Nuñez 2009, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), except for a few sites in Argentina, and Bolivia.<br/><br/>Given that most populations seem to be small and given that, with a few exceptions, populations may be threatened by habitat loss, and other threats, we think it is much safer to consider that Tarukas are vulnerable to extinction.","Tarukas have been found at 2,000-3,500 m asl in the southern portion of their distribution in Argentina (Cajal 1983), at 2,500-4,600 m asl in northern Chile (Contreras <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1986, Lagos, pers. Comm.), and at 3,500-5,000 m asl in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia (Jungius 1974, Merkt 1985, Yensen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994,&#160;Barrio 1998,&#160;Barrio&#160;2004). In Bolivia, this species was also found at lower altitudes (2,300 m asl) at the interandean valley named Araca (Nuñez 2008), which is covered mostly by sparse trees.<br/><br/>Tarukas live in areas with wet weather on the eastern Andes (Jungius 1974,&#160;Barrio 2004), as well as areas with dry weather on the western Andes (Merkt 1985, Contreras<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1986,&#160;Barrio 1998). Tarukas are usually found above the treeline on mountain slopes characterized by rock and cliff-like outcrops amid grassland vegetation (Jungius 1974, Merkt 1985,&#160;Merkt&#160;1987,&#160;Barrio 2004). They seem to prefer rocky areas of sparse vegetation with nearby water sources - usually a small ravine, lagoon or marsh (Merkt 1985,&#160;Barrio 2004), however, they have been observed in dense shrubbery near rivers and inside <em>Polylepis </em>sp. forests (Barrio in prep).<br/><br/>In several sections of the distribution, Taruka subpopulations live in fragmented portions of the range (Cajal 1983,&#160;Barrio 1999). The Taruka shares its habitat with domestic stock, which might compete with Taruka and decrease the area available to them (Barrio 1999, 2004).","Threats to the species include competition with domestic stock, habitat destruction, trophy hunting, and predation by domestic dogs (Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1973, Merkt pers. comm). In Bolivia, major threats are habitat destruction and illegal hunting (Nuñez 2009, Rechberger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Antlers are used in traditional medicine to cure facial paralysis (Tarifa pers. comm.) and dried meat is used by rural populations (CDC 1987). Threats in Chile include conflict with local farmers, predation by domestic dogs and displacement from their former habitat (gorges with water courses) to drier areas (Fuentes-Allende <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).","Based on data and assessments from a few localities in every country, the total population estimate would be 15,750-21,000 individuals (see the <em>Rationale</em> for data for each country). According to a conservative effective population size of 25% of total population, we may infer that the number of mature breeding adults may be between 4,162 and 5,750 individuals (&lt;60% of the threshold 10,000 individuals set for a vulnerable category for the species).",Decreasing,"The Taruka occurs as scattered subpopulations with very few contact areas among them, a distribution explained by the specialized habitat it uses. Its distribution can be regarded as almost continuous along the highlands of the Andes from the north of Peru to northeastern Chile, but we should be aware that the habitat type used is isolated in some areas, and human density is high between patches. The Taruka occurs in heavily fragmented subpopulations throughout the high Andes of Bolivia (with no records in the southwest), as well as in Chile (with three fragmented populations between Tacora volcano and Tarapacá gorge, Matta pers. Comm.) and in northwest Argentina.<br/><br/>The historical distribution was probably the same as the current one, but subpopulations might have been less fragmented. Nevertheless, historical (Mellet 1908) and archaeological records (Díaz 1995) suggest that Taruka distribution in Chile extended to Antofagasta district, approximately 590 km to the south of the current limit in this country.<br/><br/>Contrary to several publications (Geist 1998, Weber and Gonzalez 2003, Wemmer 1998), the Taruka has never occurred in Ecuador (Barrio 2013, Pinto <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). It is unlikely that the Taruka has ever crossed north of the Huancabamba depression in north Peru, even during the Pleistocene, when the habitat type it currently uses was lower than present altitude. Then, the high Andes were populated by other deer genera (Hoffstetter 1986, Wheeler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1976). The asseveration of the former presence of Taruka in Ecuador was based on doubtful records (Tirira 2001). One specimen in the Buenos Aires museum and another in the Field Museum, Chicago, were marked as coming from Ecuador (Voss 2003), but both have disappeared and could have come from anywhere else, for example Peru or Chile, if they were correctly identified. Another two specimens were deposited in the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid (Voss 2003). These were authentic records from Ecuador, as the collector, the collection site and the year were identified (Voss 2003), but both specimens were also lost and there is no way to verify the species.","The species is hunted as an agricultural pest, or for sport.&#160;Antlers are used in traditional medicine to cure facial paralysis (Tarifa pers. comm.) and dried meat is used by rural populations&#160;(J. Barrio pers. obs).",Terrestrial,"The species is included on CITES Appendix I and occurs in several protected areas across its range. Recommended conservation actions include: systematic surveys to determine status and extent of geographic distribution; support continued ecological studies of the species throughout its range; strengthen protected areas management; improve livestock management through farmer education demonstration projects. Population trends monitoring programs are needed. We suggest that at least three study sites per country should be included, considering the use of a standardized method, probably including direct observations, and spoor. At least one of the sites should be within a protected area for each country.<br/><br/>This species has been evaluated as Endangered in Bolivia (Nuñez 2009), based on a thorough survey within the country (Nuñez 2008).<br/><br/><em>Hippocamelus antisensis </em>has been declared a natural national monument (<em>Monumento Natural Nacional</em>) by Law Nº 24702 in Argentina, since 1996. This enabled the protection of taruka’s hábitat in Argentina.<br/><br/>Tarukas are considered as “Endangered” in Chile, by Law Nº 19300 and their hunting is banned by Law 19473. There is also a National Plan for their conservation since 2006 (CONAF 2006), but no actions have been developed so far and its habitat is poorly represented in protected areas (Matta pers. comm).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

However, subspecies <em>Capreolus capreolus italicus</em> is rare (&lt;10,000 mature individuals) and faces serious threats. <em>C. c. coxi </em>is probably also at risk in the Middle East.","It occupies a wide variety of habitats, including deciduous, mixed or coniferous forests, moorland, pastures, arable land, and suburban areas with large gardens. It prefers landscapes with a mosaic of woodland and farmland (Stubbe 1999) but can survive in semi-desert environments and above the tree line seasonally. Roe Deer are well adapted to modern agricultural landscapes (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1998, Danilkin 1996, Sempéré <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat in Europe is the increased mixing of various genetic pools as a result of translocations. This may be a particular threat to genetically distinct peripheral populations, such as those in northern Portugal, the southern Italian Apennines, and Greece (Randi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). Molecular studies show that Roe Deer in central and southern Europe are mainly admixed (Lorenzini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Randi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), indicating that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic structure of populations. The small isolated populations of <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em> in central and southern Italy (Castelporziano, Rome, and Gargano National Park) are also threatened by poaching and predation by free-ranging dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> (Lorenzini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). The small remnant population in Syria is under severe threat from habitat reduction and human persecution (Masseti 2000). Illegal hunting, poaching, collisions with vehicles mainly in the western Black Sea Region, and predation by dogs, are the main threats to the species in Turkey.","It is widespread and common, and is expanding in many areas. Having almost gone extinct in parts of southern Europe because of habitat loss and over-harvesting in the first half of the last century, its numbers started increasing again 20-40 years ago because of countryside abandonment, improved hunting regimes and reintroductions (Gortázar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Densities in the northern and southern parts of the range tend to be lower than in the central parts of the range. The central European population is estimated to number <em>c. </em>15 million individuals. However, the endemic Italian subspecies <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em>, which is largely restricted to southern Tuscany, probably numbers no more than 10,000 individuals and is at significant risk from hybridization with introduced <em>C. c. capreolus </em>(Lorenzini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Mucci <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), which has a large, expanding population in the Italian peninsula. In addition, a small population of <em>C. c. capreolus</em> has been introduced to and kept in an enclosure in Nebrodi National Park on Sicily (Masseti 2011).<br/><br/>In Turkey, the population is estimated at 6,000-8,000 individuals and has been probably increasing in the Black Sea region for two decades due to rural population declines (H. Ambarli pers. comm.).",Increasing,"The Roe Deer has a large range in the Palaearctic. It is found through most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Cyprus, Corsica, Sardinia, and most of the smaller islands), including western Russia (Stubbe 1999). Outside Europe, it occurs in Turkey, northern Syria, northern Iraq, northern Iran, and the Caucasus (Wilson and Reeder 2005). Along the Black Sea coast and in the northern Aegean region of Turkey, the Mediterranean sub-populations are close to extinction. It is extinct in Israel and Lebanon (Wilson and Reeder 2005) (though a re-introduction programme has started in Israel (M. Masseti pers. comm.). It occurs from sea level up to 2,400 m asl in the Alps (von Lehmann and Sägesser 1986) and Pyrenees (González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>In southern Europe there are two subspecies with relatively restricted ranges. <em>C. c. italicus</em> occurs in central and southern Italy, between southern Tuscany, Latium and Puglia, to Calabria (Lorenzini <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Randi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). <em>C. c. garganta</em> occurs in southern Iberia, in particular in Andalusia (Sierra de Cádiz) (Lorenzini <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006, Lorenzini <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).","With the exception of some small populations in the southern part of its range, the extensive hunting of this species is sustainable.",Terrestrial,"The species is listed on the Bern Convention (Appendix III), and occurs in a large number of protected areas across its range. In general, this species can quickly re-build its numbers and may tolerate a relatively high hunting pressure, if in a suitable habitat and under an appropriate hunting regime.

But there are subspecies&#160;that are in danger of becoming extinct e.g.&#160;<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis</em>&#160;because on the island where it occurs, density is very low, because there are feral dogs and predation is high.<br/><br/>One obstacle involved in evaluating mule deer populations trend is inconsistent and incomplete data collections as stated by Carpenter <em>et al.</em> (2003). This problem results from the wide variety of methodologies and approaches used by states and provinces for Mule Deer management. There is a real need to standardize many of the methodologies to obtain data collections and establish protocols to obtain those measurements about Mule Deer populations.","Mule Deer are well adapted to a variety of habitats including temperate forest, desert and semidesert, open range, grassland, field and scrub habitats as well as Mountainous areas.","Today the most urgent threat to Mule Deer in the wild is the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Currently CWD is more prominent at the local or regional level. CWD has currently been diagnosed in Mule Deer in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States and other mid-western states. Other threats include: high predator populations (including feral dogs), competition with livestock grazing, human habitat alterations and other anthropogenic forces. Although most of the subspecies are not threatened, the Cedro Island subspecies (<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrocensis</em>) is considered to be Vulnerable (IUCN 1988) because of the low numbers and the high predation by feral dogs and poaching.","Where they occur Mule Deer populations are typically managed by federal, state and provincial agencies that monitor abundance and trends in order to set species management objectives. As a result Mule Deer remain abundant throughout much of their native range and are not currently in urgent need of further conservation action, but some evidence in the United State and Canada has shown declines in some populations (Bellard <em>et al</em>. 2001). Additionally in Mexico some data show local extinction of some populations in the Chihuahuan desert region of Coahuila and Nuevo León Mexico (Martínez-Muñoz <em>et al</em>. 2002), and in some populations we found evidence of metapopulation dynamics for this specie (Sanchez- Rojas and Gallina 2000).",Stable,"<em>Odocoileus hemionus</em> occurs throughout western North America from Alaska and Western Canada through the Rocky Mountains and Western Plains States of the United States south to the Peninsula of Baja California, Cedro Island, Tiburon Island and Northwestern Mexico.

However, a serious decline is nevertheless evident. Older sources seem to portray relatively healthy populations, in China (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990) and the Korean Peninsula (Won and Smith 1999). These are now decreasing due to poaching and habitat destruction. This species is not particularly adaptable and appears to be rather sensitive to environmental changes, which are ongoing and do not appear to be under control. Recent (prior to 2008) publications have suggested that the range for this species, especially in China continues to shrink. A decline rate of at least 30% over three generations (approximately 18 years) seems highly plausible.","<span lang=""EN-US"">Water Deer is evidently an ""edge"" species, preferring habitats characterized by shrubs and small trees (Rhim and Lee 2007). It prefers coastal plains, salt marshes, and riparian areas, and is negatively affected by human presence (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2006a, b). It is unclear whether the species persists in Korea in purely agricultural areas away from the semi-natural riparian vegetation associated with large rivers and coastal plains (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). However, further south in Korea, where unmodified waterways and patches of fallow habitat persist, Water Deer appears capable of living in rice-paddies (N. Moores pers. comm. 2008). As suggested by its name, Water Deer can swim (Guo and Zhang 2002), but appears unlikely to colonize areas &gt;20 km from a source population. <br/> <br/>Other than during the mating season, it is in general a solitary species; stable pairs or small groups have been reported in places with high population densities. The rut, in England, starts in late November and extends through December and occasionally into January. From May to July, females will deliver litters of up to six fawns although the most common figure is only from one to three). Offspring mortality is high, with up to 40% of juveniles dying during their first four weeks.","Poaching and habitat destruction are major threats to this species (Won and Smith 1999). The species is valued for its meat, and for the semi-digested milk found in the rumen of unweaned fawns, which is used in traditional medicine as a cure against indigestion in children (Won and Smith 1999). It is sometimes trapped as a pest in China, and is reported to be a low-concern pest of rice fields in DPR Korea (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Hunting is carried out at night with dogs (Sun Lixing pers. comm. 1990). Most hunting in DPR Korea is probably with snares; guns are highly restricted and active hunting with dogs, although doubtless occurring to some extent, is too publicly visible to be the preferred choice. Snares for deer are at very high density in forest hill areas; no assessment has been made of their usage in the lower Chongchon plain where Water Deer remain common. It is not therefore possible to speculate on the species' resilience to such hunting (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>In Yancheng Nature Reserve, poaching is reported as severe, and there is high mortality during periods of flooding. Fawns have been bought from local people to establish and support the captive population, where the mortality rate is reportedly high (Zhang 1994).&#160;Water Deer&#160;have evidently been reduced or extirpated in most of the reserve, remaining only in the relatively small core area (Xu <em>et al</em>. 1998, Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Habitat loss through reclamation for agriculture and urban development is a major threat to&#160;Water Deer&#160;in eastern China (Xu <em>et al</em>. 1998). Formerly widespread areas of appropriate habitat north of the Yangtze River delta have been lost and the remaining areas fragmented, leaving remaining subpopulations of&#160;Water Deer&#160;vulnerable. <br/><br/>The Korean subpopulations, at least in DPR Korea, are highly threatened by habitat loss, on the assumption that wild population will not persist in fully agricultural landscapes. It is reported, however, to be ""moderately widespread"" at least in the Republic of Korea. In DPR Korea, agricultural policies have led to a large-scale land rezoning programme which involves the canalisation of streams, removal of damp hollows and generally the conversion to active farmland of all areas within the plains which have retained semi-natural vegetation to date. This programme is ongoing. Coastal habitats have so far fared better but there are ambitious plans for the reclamation of large proportions of the intertidal areas on the west coast, and this will involve major loss of the currently extensive suitable habitat present in natural coastal plains. With no empirical information on the use of purely agricultural regions by&#160;Water Deer&#160;in Korea, the precise effects of these ongoing and planned habitat changes are unclear; field study is required. Ground-dwelling mammals in DPR Korea are under heavy snaring pressure, at least in forest areas. The extent of snaring in the non-forest habitats occupied by this species and the effects of snaring on local populations are unclear. The situation in the lower Chongchon plain, an area with high human population densities and heavy conversion of plains land to agriculture (although retaining a largely natural coastal zone and channel profile for the river itself) suggest that either snaring levels are not so high in these areas or Water Deer&#160;are resilient to them (J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Population densities have been said to be rather low in most places within its native range (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Won and Smith 1999, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2006), but few if any primary data have been presented in support of this. Signs (footprints, faeces) and sightings suggest high densities persist in semi-natural habitats of at least the lower (tidal) Chongchon plain of west-central DPR Korea (Pyongan North and Pyongang South provinces) in 2000-2004 although, as indicated above, some supplementation by released stock cannot be ruled out (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). At another area holding the species in DPR Korea, Mount Kuwol (Hwanghae South province), signs were difficult to find in 1999 despite specific searches, although local farmers reported that significant numbers were still present. Repeated searches in the Myohyang mountains (Pyongan North, Pyongang South and Chagang provinces) in 1999-2004 found no evidence of the species but suitable habitat was marginal. Water Deer are readily observed in the outskirts of Pyongyang but are presumably releases and/or the descendents of releases. Reasonable numbers are reported to persist elsewhere in the DPR Korea lowlands (Ju Jong Sil, Academy of Sciences, verbally 2003 to J.W. Duckworth). <br/><br/>Water Deer occur in the Republic of Korea and it said to be ""moderately widespread"", particularly along the west coast, as well as within the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas (Kim and Cho 2005), but its population cannot be estimated. <br/><br/>Within China, Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) estimated fewer than 10,000 individuals in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River; 1,200-1,500 in coastal areas of Jiangsu; 600-800 in the Zhoushan Islands of Zhejiang; and 1,000 in the Poyang Lake (Jiangxi) region. Sheng (1998) estimated 500-1,1000 in the coastal areas of Jiangsu (see also Xu <em>et al</em>. 1998), 1,500 in the Zhoushan Islands, around 1,000 in the Poyong Lake region, and an additional ~500 individuals in Anhui. <br/><br/>Hu <em>et al</em>. (2006) present a map showing a considerable reduction in the current distribution of <em>H. inermis</em> compared with its known, historical range, and describe population declines of the species as ""drastic"". Their map suggests that the species no longer occurs in Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, or Fujian provinces, and has become rarer in Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang provinces. However, the time period over which this range reduction is not known with any precision. Hu <em>et al.</em> (2006) also provide data suggesting that <em>H. inermis</em> in the eastern-most (and densest) populations within China in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces retain a relatively high amount of genetic diversity, although populations on the Zhoushan archipelago displayed some divergence from those on the mainland. Within Yancheng Nature Reserve, their geographic distribution decreased and became markedly more fragmented between the 1980s and 2001 (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in China (formerly from Liaoning to Guangxi including the lower Yangtze Basin) and Korea; it has been introduced to England and France (Whitehead 1993).<br/><br/>The Chinese population was originally found in Jilin and Liaoning provinces in the northeast of the country, in the eastern Yangtze Basin and islands at the mouth of this river, and in the southeast of the country in northwestern Guangdong, southern Hunan and central and eastern Guangxi (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990). According to Hu <em>et al</em>. (2006) it is now restricted in China to the central portion of that distribution in the eastern Yangtze Basin, and populations in northeastern and southeastern China are now extinct. <br/><br/>Currently, the species' distribution in both Koreas may be substantially reduced, but little specific information is available. It is reported as being ""relatively widespread"" in the Republic of Korea (N. Moores pers. comm. 2008), particularly along the west coast. It apparently remains relatively widespread in the lower-lying parts of DPR Korea, but assessing the true status is confounded by repeated reports of widespread and frequent releases of captive-bred stock. It is unclear at what levels these occurred in the past; since the mid-1990s they are likely to have been only at low, if any, levels in all except a few high profile areas. It is possible that Chinese stock have been included in the captive populations within DPR Korea, although this has not been confirmed (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008).","The Chinese Water Deer is legally and illegally hunted within its native area, as a source of venison and traditional medicines - the semi-digested milk found in the rumen of unweaned fawns is used in traditional medicine as a cure against indigestion in children (Won and Smith 1999).&#160;There is a very limited stalking market for this species in the UK.&#160;Specimens are usually killed during, or shortly after, the capture process.

Yet, insufficient information is currently available in order to quantitatively measure threats and rates of decline and for this reason the species is reassessed Data Deficient.<br/><br/>Additionally, recent and ongoing research in Peru reveals that the population of the eastern slopes of the Central Andes of Peru (Montane Forest and Yungas, up to the limit with the Humid Puna) is a different species (yet undescribed; Barrio and colab. pers. comm).

This species is probably threatened, however, the degree to which is unclear. Until there is some knowledge of what the range of the taxa is in relation to <em>M. americana</em> and where the species remains within the known range, then it is not possible to apply the Red List Categories and Criteria. There is growing concern as to the effects of the numerous possible threats to this species - in some regions it remains only in protected areas while in others is seems to survive outside of protected areas. Hunting could be a serious threat and therefore until the limits to the distribution are better defined it is not possible to say the extent and effect of the threats. <br/><br/>In recent years information has been generated regarding its abundance and/or distribution; however, there is a lack of information regarding these aspects within its entire distribution range. It is a species that is found in preserved tropical rainforest areas but has also been recorded in areas with secondary vegetation. The extent of disturbance to which these species can adapt is not known with certainty, but there are records of sites with large cropland and pasture areas where the presence of this species is low or not present at all. It is unknown whether this species’ density is naturally low or if there are factors that cause these reductions. Mexico has records of hunting as a means of population control since this species is a bean cultivation plague; moreover, its abundance and distribution have been reduced in some areas within the southeast part of Mexico due to catastrophic events such as forest fires.","The Brocket Deer is considered characteristic of well-preserved high forest sites (Branan and Marchinton 1985, Eisenberg 1989). It occupies perennial forest, cloud forest, sub-perennial forest and low-dry forest (Reyna-Hurtado 2002, Ivan-Lira and Naranjo-Piñera 2003). It can, however, be found at transformed sites such as secondary forests and cropland as well (Bodmer 1989, Bello 2004), but in some conserved areas it avoids deforested areas and agricultural vegetation types (Weber 2005). During three years of camera-trapping in the Cordillera Talamanca region in Costa Rica - the species was found in a variety of native (but not altered) forest and non forest habitats, and from lowlands to paramo (2,800 m asl) (J. Schipper unpublished data). In areas with high hunting intensity, brocket deer also use low flooded forest (Reyna-Hurtado 2002). Its preference for well-preserved sites seems to be a protective strategy, as deer can stand still and hide in thick vegetation when a predator approaches, or run through it without being easily caught (Pinder and Leeuwenberg 1997). Further research is needed to determine the degree of disturbance and isolation of the fragments that they inhabit.","Habitat fragmentation and degradations for agricultural and livestock activities is one of the principal factors in the reduction of their potential habitats and distribution. This also includes natural disasters such as wildfire (Bello 2004). Hunting is a major threat in some areas - especially in and around protected areas. Harvesting for cultural activities, and principally as a food source, could influence their population levels and behaviour (Reyna-Hurtado 2002). Another threat that has existed for a long time is their killing as a pest control in bean croplands (Méndez-Izquierdo and Bello-Gutiérrez 2005).","Total populations are unknown. There is some information about density but only at local level abundance for Mexico. Including Protected Areas, the estimates were of 0.09 deer/km² in tropical forest (including <em>M.

Additionally, a projected continuing decline of the extent of  occurrence based on continuing deforestation together with a low  percentage of protected areas (two National Parks) may result in more  than 30% reduction of the population. For this reason the species is listed Vulnerable due to an ongoing population decline, suspected to be greater than 30%, over a period of three generations (21 years) considering both the past (10 years) and future (11 years) suspected from loss of primary habitat.","Originally found in montane forests and paramos at altitudes between 1,000 and 3,500 m asl in  mountain chains and massifs crossing over Venezuela (Zulia, Tachira, Apure, Merida, and Trujillo) and Colombia (La Guajira, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Santander, Boyaca). Linares (1998) reports <em>M. bricenii</em> as present on the eastern flank of Perija massive based on animal body parts that he collected at 3,100 m in Cerro Viruela near Pico Tetari. Thus, it is highly probable that the species also occupies paramos on the Colombian side of Perija.  <br/><br/>The main habitat of <em>M. bricenii</em> is paramos and tropical montane cloud forests above 1,500 m. The paramos are high altitude grasslands (Boom <em>et al.</em> 2001), which are dominated by <em>Calamagrostis </em>spp. and gigantic Andean rosette plants from the genus Espeletia (Luteyn 1992). The tropical montane cloud forest is a type of vegetation that has special climatic conditions causing cloud and mist to be regularly in contact with the forest vegetation (Bruijnzeel and Veneklaas 1998). These forests support ecosystems of distinctive floristic and structural forms with lower canopy and thicker understory than lowland forests (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1963). Details on <em>M. bricenii</em> ecology are unknown, although it seems to be solitary, active at day as well as at night, and expected to be a browser/frugivore in the forest understory. They are shy and secretive animals, rarely seen because of their nocturnal habits. They live either alone or in pairs and normally within a small territory. They usually defecate in latrines probably located at boundaries of territories. Further research is required.","Habitat destruction occurs due to small-scale cattle ranching and agriculture practised by local communities through forest cutting and burning of montane grasslands and shrub lands. Illegal plantations of opium and Coca may be the main cause of habitat destruction in some areas of Colombia (Alvarez 2007). Mining, road construction and colonization expand habitat loss. Climate change might also result in a reduction of available habitat for the species in the future, since cloud forests and paramos are broadly affected by atmospheric temperature rise (Foster 2001).

According to present forest distribution, the largest populations of <em>M. bricenii</em> should be located in the following Venezuelan national parks: El Tama National Park, between Táchira and Apure states; Páramos del Batallón National Park between Mérida and Táchira states; Sierra Nevada National Park between Barinas and Mérida states; Sierra de la Culata National Park in Mérida and Trujillo states; Guaramacal National Park also known as ""General Cruz Carrillo"" in the state of Trujillo, with a small portion located in the state of Portuguesa (Utrera 1999); and Dinira National Park located in Sierra de Barbacoas, in watersheds of Tocuyo river between Lara, Portuguesa and Trujillo states. Dinira and Guaramacal probably form the eastern most location of the species within Venezuela. Some populations might be expected outside protected areas in the hinterlands between Sierra Nevada and Páramos del Batallon national parks, an area known as Pueblos del Sur de Mérida, and between Guaramacal and Sierra Nevada national parks, known as Ramal de Calderas.

New highway construction and mining also pose additional future threats to the species. Based on a habitat model of museum records in Colombia, Ecuador, and  Peru shows a habitat reduction of 47% of their original habitat. Most  of the 30% reduction happened in the last ten years, at least in  Colombia, as result of severe deforestation and agriculture. Habitat  destruction has occurred for decades in the range of the Dwarf Red  Brocket.

Its area of occupancy, based on maximal extent of plausibly occupied habitat, as shown in this account's map, is estimated to be <em>circa</em> 1,100 km².<br/><br/><em>Rusa alfredi </em>density is not known but given that this species is still extensively hunted throughout its range, it is plausible that it is at very low densities, perhaps comparable to those of Sambar (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>)<em> </em>in heavily hunted parts of its range. Sambar density in Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, Thailand, a relatively well protected area that retains a breeding population of Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>)<em> </em>and wild Water Buffalo (<em>Bubalus arnee</em>)<em> </em>is about 2 to 3 individuals km². In Taman Nagara National Park, Malaysia, hunting has reduced the density of Sambar to &lt;1 animal per km². In India density ranges from 1 to 10 animals per km² depending on the level of protection from hunting. In other parts of its range Sambar density is simply too low to permit estimation (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2015). Assuming then that the situation for <em>Rusa alfredi </em>is more similar to Sambar in Malaysia and to areas receiving little protection in India, than to Huai Kha Khaeng in Thailand, an estimated density of &lt;1 animal per km² seems likely. This would give a population of about 1,100 animals and assuming that about two-thirds of the pre-breeding population are mature individuals, this would suggest a population of approximately 700 mature individuals. <br/><br/>Given that the species remains under intense hunting pressure and habitat loss is ongoing, the population decline is most likely to be continuing and the disjunct nature of the surviving distribution means that there are highly likely to be fewer than 250 mature individuals in each subpopulation, thus meeting the criteria for Endangered C2a(i). This species' assessment should be updated as new information on its population status becomes available.","This deer formerly occurred from sea-level to at least 2,000 m asl in primary and secondary growth forest. It can persist in some degraded habitats such as cogon grasslands as long as there are areas of dense cover. Its preferred habitat is not clear, since it is now restricted to steep, rugged slopes of dipterocarp forest that are inaccessible to humans (Cox 1987). It was known to rely on dense forest for refuge (Rabor 1977), but also frequents open grassy patches and secondary communities. Rabor (1977) reports that the main constituents of its diet are young shoots of cogon grass (found in clearings) and young low-growing leaves and buds within forests. It is predominantly a browser, but also a grazer (captive animals also relish fruit). It also visits burnt forest clearings for the pioneering shoots that grow there. All local reports indicate an average group size of one to three individuals—mostly solitary males and females with single young—though it remains unclear whether or not these small group sizes are a function of continued and sustained hunting pressure, particularly as much larger numbers of individuals have been maintained peacefully together in captivity for indefinite periods (W. Oliver, pers. obs). The species breeds year round in captivity and young animals are reported to be captured in the wild at all times of the year.","This species has declined primarily as a result of habitat conversion (agriculture and logging) and hunting (Cox 1987, Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991, Oliver 1992). Despite being fully protected by law, it is still intensively hunted throughout its remaining range; both by local farmers in hinterland communities and recreational hunters from larger cities; both of these groups use the species as game (for meat and trophies), rather than for subsistence purposes (Cox 1987, Evans <em>et al</em>. 1993, Oliver 1994, Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1992). Both of these groups may also sell any surplus meat as venison in local markets or to speciality restaurants; whereas local hunters from upland communities also specialize in live-captures to meet strong demand for these animals as pets (particularly amongst local politicians). Many of these are supplied by the orphans of hunter-killed animals, though almost all such captive stocks also include animals captured as adults in leg snares, as evidenced by the amputation of their lower limbs.<br/><br/>There is continuing severe habitat fragmentation and reduction of populations from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, and some populations are now so reduced in size as to be of doubtful viability. Hybridization with <em>R. mariannus</em> has been repeatedly observed amongst poorly (i.e., unscientifically) managed captive stocks of these two species, but (and despite previously published fears to the contrary) is most unlikely to pose any additional threats to the few surviving populations of <em>R. alfredi</em> given the evident allopatry in the natural ranges of these two species (Cox 1987; Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1991; Oliver 1993, 1996).","The species is considered to be rare throughout its present, limited range. Populations are fragmented and declining, although evidently the species is able to use a wide variety of habitats. Currently, the species is estimated to have been extirpated from 95% to 98% of its former range (Oliver <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1991, 1996). There is no global estimate of the population size, but it is reasonable to suppose that it is fewer than 2,500 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Recent biological surveys of southern Negros suggest that the species is  far less numerous than is the Visayan Warty Pig (<em>Sus cebifrons</em>) (N.  Maddison pers. comm. 2016). Sambar density in Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, Thailand, a relatively well protected area that retains a breeding population of Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and wild Water Buffalo (<em>Bubalus arnee</em>) is about 2 to 3 individuals km².

However, the formal declaration of the latter area eventually due to lack of unanimity amongst relevant local government units and a number of separate, smaller areas have since been declared, though these do not cover all of the most important sites, nor have any of these areas been significantly better protected since declaration owing the absence of any corresponding national budgetary allocations. Small numbers of individuals are also reported to survive in Hinoba-an in southwestern Negros Oriental, though there is now very little forest remaining in this area.<br/><br/>The Philippine Spotted Deer Conservation Programme (PSDCP) was formally established in April in 1990 under the auspices of a new Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR, Government of the Philippines) and the Parc Zoologique et Botanique de la Ville Mulhouse (Mulhouse Zoo, France), to enable development of a properly structured conservation breeding programme (viz: the ‘World Herd’ of captive <em>R. alfredi</em>) based on the accession of donated and confiscated individuals, previously illegally held as pets by private owners, and to initiate a variety of other related, highest conservation priority activities. These included: development of three local wildlife rescue and breeding centres (two on Negros, one on Panay); wide-ranging field surveys and other field studies; assistance in the establishment of new protected areas and related habitat restoration measures; distribution-wide public awareness campaigns; and diverse personnel training and other local capacity-building initiatives. This programme has since constituted easily the most successful programme of its kind in the Philippines but, and more importantly, it was also established and managed as a ‘flagship’ species/programme for the ‘West Visayas (or ‘Negros–Panay’) Faunal Region’; one of the world’s highest conservation priority areas in terms of both numbers of threatened endemic taxa and degrees of threat.

Recent data (Semiadi 2008, unpubl data) indicate that near Banjar (West Java) there is a possibility of significant numbers of animals in a fragmented teak forest and mixed local and agricultural forest.<br/><br/>The vegetation in which they occur is dominated by mixed age teak (<em>Tectona grandis</em>) plantations interspersed with lalang grasslands (<em>Imperata cylindrical</em>), brush and patches of secondary forest. This apparently provides an optimum habitat for this species. Javan Warty Pigs are everywhere restricted to elevations below about 800 m. The reasons for this are not known, but it might be due to their being unable to tolerate low temperatures (Blouch 1993). They evidently prefer secondary or disturbed forests, though they are also often found near the coasts in remnant patches of mangrove and swamp forest such as in Pangandaran (West Java) and Cilacap (Central Java). They are rare in the few remaining lowland primary forests, and in areas with high human populations where otherwise suitable habitat is fragmented and surrounded by agricultural land. However, they do feed on crops, making nocturnal raids on fields of corn and cassava and, in common with <em>Sus scrofa</em>, the species is widely persecuted for such depredations (Blouch 1988).","Semiadi and Meijaard (2006) hypothesized that the population decline observed in this species is primarily caused by a decline in suitable habitat, especially of stands of teak <em>Tectona grandis</em> forest or similar forest plantations, and by high hunting pressure. With the imposed regulation by the government for teak plantation forests to adopt a mixed agriculture system (agroforestry system) by cultivating agricultural products in between the young teak plantations, teak plantation forests become suitable <em>Sus verrucosus</em> habitat. However, a 35-50 year cycle of teak forest harvest remains a threat for the availability of this habitat. In any case, there is extensive illegal logging of teak plantations, no doubt to the detriment of <em>S. verrucosus</em>. These animals are killed both by sport hunters and by farmers protecting their crops (Blouch 1995). Many animals are killed by poisoning (Semiadi and Meijaard, 2006). As yet unpublished reports of the recent dramatic reduction in numbers, possibly resulting in the extirpation, of <em>S. v. blouchi</em>, on Bawean Island have been attributed to correspondingly increased hunting pressure following the recent settlement of Christian immigrants from Sumatra; these animals having been previously left largely unharmed by the predominantly Moslem inhabitants. Competition from and hybridization with the Eurasian wild pig, <em>Sus scrofa</em>  has been speculated as a further threat to <em>S. verrucosus</em>, especially in areas where human induced habitat changes have favoured <em>S. scrofa</em>, though there is little direct evidence for this and the two species evidently occur sympatrically in some areas, including Bawean Island.","The species occurs in at least 10 isolated areas on mainland Java, although some additional, probably very small populations, might survive elsewhere (Semiadi and Meijaard 2006). For example, recently another pocket area was found in Banjar (West Java), though intensive survey work is needed to establish the size of the area and the population (Semiadi 2007 unpubl. data). There are no estimates of overall population size, but the species has shown a rapid population decline in recent decades. Compared to a survey conducted in 1982, 17 of the 32 (53%) populations are extinct or have dropped to low encounter rate levels (Semiadi and Meijaard 2006).<br/> <br/>Semiadi and Meijaard (2004), as a result of widespread interviews, reported the species from the following areas:<br/><ol><li><em>S. verrucosus</em> occurs in the area between Malingping and Rangkasbitung, but is rarely encountered. There were no reports of recent kills of <em>verrucosus</em>, but some were shot several years ago. Semiadi and Meijaard (2006) considered that that a small population probably remains. However, because <em>S. scrofa</em> is a major agricultural pest, hunting intensity is high</li><li>Pigs are common in the area between Sukabumi and the coastal nature reserve of Cikepuh, and are considered a major agricultural pest. <em>S. verrucosus</em>, however, is rarely encountered, with two hunters reporting that they had not shot one since 1998. One hunter suggested that over-hunting was the most likely cause of the species’ decline.</li><li>Interviewees in the area near Purwakarta reported the presence of <em>S. verrucosus</em> between the 1960s and 1990s, with steady declines of the weight of killed animals and numbers of pigs encountered. They now consider <em>verrucosus</em> to be very rare, the latest report being a specimen that was shot in 2001.</li><li>Near and south of Garut several small populations remain, with reported sightings of <em>S. verrucosus</em> in 2002 and 2001.</li><li>Around Majalengka and towards Sumedang interviewees reported recent sightings or killings of <em>S. verrucosus</em>, but all emphasize that the species is now much rarer than in the past.

There were several reports of recent sightings or killings. Still, people consider <em>S. verrucosus</em> to be rare in comparison to <em>S. scrofa</em>.</li><li>Several interviewees reported recent sightings of <em>verrucosus</em> from the area around Cilacap, Cipatujuh, and Nusakambangan Nature Reserve, including some from the Nusakambangan Nature Reserve offshore Cilacap, but the species seems to be rare and fragmented into many small populations.</li><li><em>S. verrucosus</em> is still relatively common around Subah, generally seen in small groups of 1–2 animals, but in up to 4–6 animals/group during mating season. Females with young are seen between August and December. <em>S. verrucosus</em> has not declined as much as <em>S. scrofa</em>, but one interviewee expected rapid population declines of the former because teak forests, its prime habitat, are disappearing.</li><li><em>S. verrucosus</em> appears to be relatively common around Blora and Bojonegoro, and every interviewee was familiar with the species and confirmed its local presence. Still, according to one interviewee, the species used to occur in groups of 10–20 animals, but now only 1–3 animals/group are encountered. Five to seven years ago, every hunt resulted in the capture of 1–2 <em>S. verrucosus</em>, or 2–3 according to another informant, but now the species is rarely caught; the most recent one in April/May 2003. One interviewee reported that pigs have especially declined since the fall of President Suharto in 1998, because then local people started to log the state-owned teak forests.</li><li>Bawean island is the only area where the subspecies <em>S. v. blouchi</em> occurs. Several interviewees reported the presence of <em>S. verrucosus</em> on the island, but all sightings predated 2002, and the reports gave the impression that the species was now rare. A recent (<em>c</em>. 2004) survey of Bawean deer <em>Axis kuhli</em> on Bawean Island also yielded disturbing reports of the likely dramatic diminution of this species and all wild pig populations (including <em>S. v. blouchi</em>) on Bawean Island, reputedly as a consequence of severe hunting pressure following the transmigration settlement of Christian communities from Sumatra (these animals having been previously left mostly undisturbed by the formerly predominant Moslem communities; R.

This inferred rate of decline is based on the apparent disappearance of several populations, and the effects of over-hunting, habitat loss and hybridization.","Originally this species occurred in primary and secondary forest from sea-level to mossy forest at 1,600 m asl. Now it occurs mostly above 800 m asl, as there are relatively few patches of suitable habitat in the lowlands (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998). It can persist in some degraded habitats such as cogon grasslands as long as there are areas of dense cover, though there is some evidence to suggest that pigs surviving in largely denuded areas are predominately composed of feral animals of mixed origin (W. Oliver pers. comm).","All of the few remaining populations of these animals are now widely fragmented and declining; both through former widespread commercial logging operations, continued low-level illegal logging and agricultural expansion (particularly slash-and-burn cultivation or ""kaingin""), and hunting pressure. The latter continues throughout its remaining range, both by local farmers in hinterland communities and recreational hunters from larger cities. Both of these groups may also sell any surplus meat which usually commands at least twice the price of domestic pork in local markets and speciality restaurants. Efforts to reduce or discourage hunting are unfortunately also often compromised by generally negative attitudes towards these animals, which can cause severe damage to crops planted within or close to existing forest boundaries, and which are therefore regarded as pests and, hence, a legitimate target for hunting activities (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1993). Unfortunately, this species is also threatened by genetic contamination via hybridization with free-ranging domestic and feral animals of ex-<em>Sus scrofa</em> origin, and hybrids have been confirmed from almost all remaining population sites (Blouch 1995; Oliver 1995, 2001).","<em>Sus cebifrons</em> has been eliminated from three of the six islands where it was known or presumed to have occurred formerly; i.e. Cebu (where the species was last reported in 1960s), Guimaras and Ticao Islands. It is also close to extinction, if not already ""functionally extinct"", on Masbate, where the species was last confirmed in 1993, at which time only a few individuals were reported to survive in one location. Consequently, potentially viable populations now survive only in the last remaining forest fragments on Negros and Panay Islands (collectively comprising <em>c</em>a 6% and &gt;4% of land area, respectively).

It is found in a variety of habitats. In Europe, it prefers broadleaved forests and especially evergreen oak forests, but may also be found in more open habitats such as steppe, Mediterranean shrubland, and farmland, so long as there is water and tree cover nearby (Spitz 1999). In Europe it is found from sea level to 2,400 in the Pyrenees (Palomo and Gisbert 2002), but it can be found at higher elevations in Asia.<br/><br/>The species is omnivorous, though stomach and fecal contents analyses indicate that vegetable matter, principally fruits, seeds, roots and tubers, constitutes about 90% of the diet (Spitz 1986). A field study of the Indonesian wild pig, <em>S. s. vittatus, </em>in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, indicated that these animals are predominately frugivorous, feeding on about 50 species of fruits, especially those of strangling figs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ficus</span> spp.), and that they are important seed dispersal agents (Pauwels 1980). By comparison, analyses of the stomach contents of wild pigs (also <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. vittatus</span>) in agricultural areas of West Malaysia by Diong (1973), revealed that sugar cane, tapioca and rice were the commonest food items, but that usually more than one type of food had been eaten, even where a single cultivated crop was abundant. Other items commonly consumed by these pigs included soil, earthworms, roots and other vegetable matter and, in mangrove areas, molluscs, crabs and other arthropods and even fishes. The consumption of invertebrate and small vertebrate prey may be a necessary component of the diet, since a study of free-ranging domestic pigs in Papua New Guinea revealed that animals fed ad libitum lost weight when denied earthworms (Rose and Williams 1983). In common with its feral derivatives (Oliver and Brisbin 1993), <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. scrofa</span> has also occasionally been reported to predate larger vertebrates, such as deer fawns and (tethered) goats (Hoogerwerf 1970), though it is possible that such incidents involve only a few individuals in the population; an aspect also noted by Pauwels (1980) when referring to the predation of sea turtle nests by wild pigs in Ujung Kulon. Similarly, a large boar (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. cristatus</span>) in Royal Chitawan National Park, Nepal, which was seen to displace an adult leopard from its kill, a domestic buffalo calf, which it then partly consumed (W. Oliver pers. obs.), was reported by Park staff to regularly commandeer such kills, but that no other individual pigs had been seen to do this.<br/><br/>Wild pigs are normally most active in the early morning and late afternoon, though they become nocturnal in disturbed areas, where activity usually commences shortly before sunset and continues throughout the night. A total of 4 to 8 hours are spent foraging or traveling to feeding areas. Feeding is generally a social activity (even solitary males may join feeding groups) which also provides an opportunity for display and other agonistic behaviours (Beuerle 1975). Radio telemetry studies in southern France indicate that they generally travel between 2 and 15 km per night, though this is often within an area of only 20 to 150 ha. However, the home range estimates for adult females and adult males over a 2-3 month period varied from 500-1,000 ha and 1,000-2,000 ha, respectively. During this same period, subadults covered an area of 500- 5,000 ha, and after 6 to 12 months they may have covered more than 10,000 ha; the larger home ranges of these animals being related to their expulsion from their natal groups and then undergoing a wandering phase. Movements over long distances (50 to 250 km) have also been recorded in Europe, but the extent and purpose of these movements has yet to be studied (Spitz 1986). Experiments in which tagged animals are released and subsequently recovered provide evidence that they disperse freely over even larger areas (500 to 750 km<sup>2</sup>), which may also indicate the area occupied by large population units. The density of free-ranging <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. scrofa</span> in Europe rarely exceeds 5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Spitz, 1986), though much higher concentrations have been reported elsewhere, e.g. 27-32/km<sup>2</sup> on Peucang Island in Ujung Kulon National Park, Java (Pauwels 1980) and 32.2-72.1/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in sugarcane areas in the Punjab, Pakistan (Shafi and Khokhar, 1985). <br/><br/>Wild pigs are gregarious, forming herds or 'sounders' of varying size depending on locality and season, but usually of between 6-20 individuals, though aggregations of over 100 have been reported (Prater 1971, Legakul and McNeely 1977, Briedermann 1990). The basic social unit is a nucleus of one or more females and their last litters. Animals peripheral to this comprise subadults from previous litters, and adult males during the mating season. However, the latter tend to stay in relatively close contact with 1 or 2 female groups at other times of the year, and subadult males or mixed sex groups of subadults may also form longer-term associations (Spitz and Janeau 1990). The dynamics of the basic group include the isolation of the preparturient female, her re-entry with young, entry of nulliparous females, the arrival of adult males with the simultaneous departure of subadult animals (Spitz 1986). In contrast to its domestic derivatives, reproductive activity in S. scrofa tends to be seasonal and positively correlated with the relative availability of principal foodstuffs or related climatic factors. In tropical countries, such as Sri Lanka, peak estrus activity has been recorded during the wettest months of November and December (Santiapillai and Chambers 1980). However, social organization may also play a role in modulating the timing of reproductive events, since farrowing is often synchronized amongst females in the same social groups, which suggests a mechanism for synchronizing the onset of estrus (Spitz 1986).<br/><br/>Wide fluctuations in the numbers of animals killed by hunters, particularly in the (former) U.S.S.R. and in France, suggest cyclic changes in the numbers of wild pigs available for hunting. Annual recruitment into the total population depends on reproductive rate (i.e. the number and prolificacy of females) and juvenile mortality, both of which factors may be influenced by the availability of foodstuffs and other external factors (Spitz 1986). In western Europe, litter size is usually between 4 and 7 piglets (Briedermann 199), though Harrison and Bates (1991) cite reports of 5 and 7-10 piglets per litter as being usual in Iraq and Armenia, respectively. Pauwels (1980) recorded an average litter size of 6-10 piglets at the beginning of the breeding season in Java, but this number dropped to only 2-4 piglets per litter towards the end of the breeding season. In the Ryukyu Islands, south of Japan, there is evidence that the wild pigs (<em>S. s. riukiuanus</em>) have two breeding seasons per year, though it remains uncertain whether individual sows normally produce litters twice a year (Yasuma 1984). Juvenile mortality averages 15% in the first three months in western Europe, though between 50% and 75% mortality have been reported by the end of the first year of life (Jezierski 1977, Briedermann 1990). These mortality rates are thought to be highly dependant on such external factors as predation and climatic hazards, at least in wilderness areas (Spitz 1986). Similarly, Pauwel (1982) suggested that the principal causes of juvenile mortality in wild pigs in Ujung Kulon were predation (particularly as a consequence of the accidental separation of infants from their mothers), along with differences in the relative rate of development of litter-mates and various parasite-related causes. These factors resulted in only about 15% of all progeny surviving to independence.","At a global level, there are no major threats to the species. However, there are many threats at a more local level, principally habitat destruction and hunting pressure, either for food, sport or in reprisal for crop damage, particularly in areas near human habitation. In Afghanistan, Hassinger (1973) cited reports of the decrease in the numbers of wild pigs in the Pul-i-Khumri District in the 1950s as a result of the draining of marshlands for agricultural purposes, and hunting by Europeans; but noted that they were still numerous in other districts where: ""they invade the fields and cause serious damage during the harvest"". In parts of Perak and Johore in West Malaysia, Diong (1973) reported that the numbers of wild pigs (<em>S. s. vittatus</em>) had diminished drastically as a result of increased hunting pressure, particularly for commercial purposes, and that most hunting methods, whether with guns, dogs or snares, was entirely non-selective. Nonetheless, wild pigs are still included in Malaysia's 'Agricultural Pest Ordinance, 1977', on account of their damage to a variety of crops, including sugar cane, tapioca, rice and even coconuts. Lay (1967) also remarked upon the damage to crops by wild pigs in Iran which: ""...brings great wrath upon them, usually ineffectual, from the local farmers"". In Pakistan, the expansion of the sugar cane industry in the 1960s and early 1970s brought about local increases in the numbers of wild pigs (<em>S. s. davidi</em>), whose depredations in the cane fields (estimated at an annual loss rate of Rs.5 million in 1978) led to the development of control measures, including the use of poison baits (Shafi and Khokhar 1985). <br/><br/>Although actually referring to wild pigs in India, it is clear that Prater's (1971) opinion that: ""No animal is more destructive to crops and, in cultivated areas, it is impossible to make a plea for its protection"", would find popular support in many other countries. In the Ryukyu Islands, south of Japan, the endemic <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> is actively regarded as an environmental pest, and bounties are paid to farmers for killing them by the Japanese Government, despite the fact that this taxon is recognized internationally as being seriously threatened throughout it extremely restricted range (see later text). In various places in Indonesia, most notably in Java, deliberate attempts have been made in the past to eradicate wild pigs altogether by means of organized shooting parties and poisoning campaigns. However, despite many thousands of wild pigs being destroyed in this way, it is clear that this has had little lasting effect on these animals which, according to Hoogerwerf (1970), have: ""remained further removed from extinction than any other species of game in Java"". This situation evidently obtains in a number of other countries, including Viet Nam (R. Ratajszsak pers. comm.) and Taiwan (K. Nowell pers. comm.), where wild pigs are reported to survive in a number of nominally protected areas where all or most of the other principal 'game' species have been eradicated by sustained hunting pressure. <br/><br/>In these and many other (non-Islamic) countries or local communities, wild pigs often constitute the single most important game animal to subsistence and/or recreational hunters. Sport hunting accounts for about 30 to 50% of animals heavier than 20 kg in southern France, though this figure may be as high as 50 to 75% in some heavily populated countries, where hunting remains largely or wholly uncontrolled (Spitz, 1986). For example, the wild pig population inhabiting the 25,000 ha of broadleaved woodlands around Monticiano in Italy, has apparently been able to sustain its numbers despite an annual hunter-kill rate of about 50% (c. 500 animals) of the population (Devitt, 1984). <br/><br/>According to figures produced by the Japanese Environment Agency a total of 1,279,453 (an average of 63,973 per annum) wild pigs were harvested in Japan between 1970 and 1989 (incl.), of which 1,083,858 (85%) were taken by hunters, and the remaining 195,596 were destroyed as crop pests during the closed season. The great majority of these animals are <em>S. s. leucomystax</em> from the main islands of Honshu, Shikoko and Kyushu, and this subspecies is evidently able to withstand high levels of harvesting to judge from contemporary reports of marginal expansions in the overall range of this subspecies (Hanai, 1982; Takahashi, 1980). Unfortunately, however, these totals do not differentiate between the numbers of <em>S. s. leucomystax</em> and those of <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> from the three small islands of Amami Oshima, Tokuno Shima and Kakeroma Jima, which are also included in these figures. As previously indicated, the latter subspecies is declining rapidly in numbers on these islands, and on the neighbouring island of Okinawa, largely as a result of over-hunting (Barber <em>et al</em>. 1984, H. Obara pers. comm.). This conclusion is also borne out by official figures on the annual harvest of <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> from two other islands, Iriomote and Ishigaki, in the Ryukyu chain between 1965 and 1981, which indicate a downward trend in the numbers of these animals (Yasuma 1984) and a marked increase in the amount of effort required by local hunters to obtain smaller catches (Hanai 1982). Nonetheless, according to these figures an average of 530 and 190 wild pigs were still being taken annually on Iriomote and Ishigaki, respectively; of which slightly more than 50% were killed as 'agricultural pests', i.e. mostly out of season, often with a Government bounty being paid. Moreover, it is certain that these totals are a serious underestimate - perhaps by as much as 50-100% - of the actual numbers killed, since many hunters operate without licenses and do not declare their catches (Barber <em>et al</em>. 1984, Yasuma 1984). Formerly, virtually all of these pigs were consumed locally but, following the restoration of electricity (and, hence, refrigeration) in 1972, commercial traders began operating on the islands, and the majority of carcasses are now exported to gourmet markets in Osaka, where they realize relatively high prices and ensure a continued demand for wild-caught meat (Yasuma 1984). <br/><br/>Wild pigs are also susceptible to a variety of highly contagious diseases which can decimate their populations. Santiapillai <em>et al</em>. (1991) referred to a catastrophic crash in the wild pig population of Ruhuna National Park in Sri Lanka in 1989 owing to an outbreak of swine fever, but that population numbers had apparently recovered by June 1991. Many wild pigs are also reported to have died during an outbreak of disease in the Kanto Region on Honshu Island, Japan in 1877 (Yanagida 1913). It is possible that this was hog cholera, contracted from domestic pigs which were imported to the region at that time (Chiba 1975), and this may have been one of the factors contributing to the extirpation of <em>S. s. leucomystax</em> throughout the north of their range on this island. An outbreak of severe skin disease (tentatively identified as sarcoptic mange) on Iriomote, which was first noted in 1976, had spread throughout the Island by 1980, and infected up to 83% of the <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> population according to data based on hunter-killed samples (Yasuma 1984).<br/><br/>The Ryukyu pigs are also threatened by genetic contamination through contact with free-ranging domesticates. On Ishigaki Island, interbreeding with domestic pigs has been so prevalent that it is doubtful if the remaining wild stock can be considered genetically pure (Obara 1982). Moreover, it is unlikely that this problem will be confined to Ishigaki, given that the meat from wild x domestic hybrids or 'ino-buta' is popular and local farmers will continue to produce it. Indeed, ino-buta have been farmed commercially on Iriomote for many years, often in poorly controlled conditions. As a result, feral ino-buta have become established on the adjacent, smaller islands of Sotobanare and Uchibanare, and it is claimed that a number of these animals have crossed onto Iriomote at low tide; thereby posing a further, serious threat to the remaining wild stock there (Yasuma 1984, Takahashi and Tisdell 1992). <br/><br/>Similarly, Genov <em>et al</em>. (1991) reported that the traditional practice of rearing 'domestic' pigs in semi-wild conditions in Bulgaria has resulted in their hybridizing with the wild boar populations in the eastern and north-eastern parts of that country, and that genetically pure wild boars now occur only in the Rila-Pirin-Rhodopes Mountains in the south of this country, where domestic pigs are not reared in the wild. The principal threat to the survival of the Monticiano population in Italy, lies not so much with the high annual hunter-kill rate but with the fact that the genetic integrity of the native population has been seriously compromised by the introduction of Central European boars after World War II, which have interbred with these animals. Indeed, the introduction of non-native wild pigs, by hunting interest groups in the belief that these were more desirable because of their larger size and reputed greater fecundity, has been so widespread in Italy that the only surviving pure-bred native stock is thought to be in the presidential reserve in Castel Porziano, near Rome (Devitt 1984).","This species is abundant in many parts of its range, though populations can be depressed in places where hunting intensity is high (for example in eastern and southeastern Asia). Eurasian wild pig populations in Europe increased markedly during the latter part of the 20th century (Spitz 1999). Recently population increases seem to slow down, but still go on in most areas. Especially in range expansion areas and recolonised countries like England, southern Sweden and Finland populations may still be increasing (Battersby 2005). In eastern Europe populations are infected with african swine fever. However, influence on the population densities is unknown. Although there is no global population estimate, numbers can be high in many places. For example, in 1982 in Mongolia, there was a population density of 0.9 per 1,000 ha in the Khovsgol area. By 1989, it was estimated that 34,000 individuals were living in the Khentii and Khangai Mountain regions of Mongolia, with an average density of 1 - 2 per 1,000 ha.",Unknown,"The Eurasian Wild Pig, as hitherto described (but see Taxonomy), has one of the widest geographic distributions of all terrestrial mammals, and this range has been greatly expanded by human agency. The species now occurs in pure wild or barely modified feral form on all continents excepting Antarctica, and on many oceanic islands. It is the ancestor of most (but not all) ancient and modern domestic pig breeds, and there is evidence to suggest that it was independently domesticated in several different parts of its range, including Southeast Asia, the Far East and Asia Minor. As a wild form, it has constituted a primary resource of subsistence hunters since the earliest times, and it is one of the most important targets for recreational hunting wherever it remains sufficiently abundant. Over-hunting and changes in land use have resulted in the fragmentation of its range and its extermination throughout the British Isles, Scandinavia, parts of North Africa, and relatively extensive parts of its range in the former Soviet Union and northern Japan. Nevertheless, the species remained widely distributed and is recently wide spread and still increasinga dn dispersing in most parts of its range with locally abundant populations. As a result of its depredations on crops it is regarded as a pest in many countries, where it remains unprotected outside designated wildlife reserves or is managed as a game animal.<br/><br/><em>S. scrofa</em> has by far the largest range of all pigs. It occurs throughout the steppe and broadleaved forest regions of the Palaearctic, from western Europe to the Russian Far East, extending southwards as far North Africa, the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East, through India, Indo-China, Japan (including the Ryukyu Chain), Taiwan and the Greater Sunda Islands of South-east Asia. Populations east of Bali are probably all introduced. It has been extinct in the British Isles since sometime in the 17th century, despite attempted introductions of new stock from Europe (Harting 1880) (though see below for more recent information). It was also extinct in southern Scandinavia (but see below), over extensive portions of its recent range in west-central and eastern parts of the former Soviet Union (Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1961), and in northern Japan (Chiba 1964, 1975). The species was last reported in Libya in the 1880s, and it became extinct in Egypt in about 1902 (Hufnagl 1972). <br/><br/>Groves and Grubb (1993) distinguished four 'subspecies groupings', based on both geographic and morphological criteria, as follows:<br/><br/>1.  'Western races' of Europe (<em>scrofa</em> and <em>meridionalis</em>), North Africa (<em>algira</em>) and the Middle East (<em>lybicus</em>), extending at least as far east as Soviet Central Asia (<em>attila and nigripes</em>);  <br/><br/>2.  'Indian races' of the sub-Himalayan region from Iran in the west (<em>davidi</em>) to north India and adjacent countries as far east as Myanmar and west Thailand (<em>cristatus</em>), and south India and Sri Lanka (<em>affinis</em> and subsp. nov.); <br/><br/>3.  'Eastern races' of Mongolia and the Soviet Far East (<em>sibiricus</em> and <em>ussuricus</em>), Japan (<em>leucomystax</em> and <em>riukiuanus</em>), Taiwan (<em>taivanus</em>), to south-east China and Viet Nam (<em>moupinensis</em>); and <br/><br/>4.  'Indonesian race' (or banded pig) from the Malay Peninsular, Sumatra, Java, Bali and certain offshore islands (<em>vittatus</em>).<br/><br/>Recently, this systematics is under revision. Thus S. scrofa remains only as the western Species, whilst most other subspecies may be own species.<br/><br/>In Europe, it is widespread in most continental areas, with the exception of northern Fennoscandia and European Russia. As mentioned above, it disappeared from the British Isles and Scandinavia in the 17th century, although it has now been reintroduced to Sweden and escaped animals have established themselves in the wild in Britain (Spitz 1999). There are at least three small wild populations in England, on the Kent/East Sussex border, in Dorset, and in Hereford (Battersby 2005). It is native to Corsica and Sardinia, but the population in Sicily was introduced (Spitz 1999). Introduced populations are not included in the distribution map.",This species is hunted for food and for sport.,Terrestrial,"Generally, few, if any, practical measures have been taken in any country for the specific purpose of conserving wild populations of any subspecies of <em>S. scrofa</em>, except in the sense of maintaining stock levels for hunting, particularly for sport hunting. Thus Genov <em>et al</em>. (1991) reported a gradual increase of the wild boar population in Bulgaria in the late 1950s following legal measures to regulate hunting, and because of the reintroduction of animals from breeding farms in the north-east of the country, in the Balkan Range and Sredna Gora. Even in this instance, however, other factors may also be operating, since similar increases in the local wild pig populations in Spain, France, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and eastern Russia have been described by Sáez-Royuela and Tellería (1986), who simply attributed this trend to a progression to a more temperate climate and, hence, progressively milder winters of benefit to these animals. <br/><br/>Local wild pig populations are also reported to be increasing in numbers in several countries as a consequence of the spread of Islam. For example, the north-west African race, <em>S. s. algira</em>, although extinct in Libya, is thought to be expanding in neighboring Algeria where it is designated a game animal but, as the meat is now seldom eaten in this country, hunting pressure has been greatly reduced since colonial times (Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalski 1991). These authors also cite earlier reports of wild boars hybridizing with domestic pigs, but the latter are no longer kept in Algeria.<br/><br/><em>S. s. riukiuanus</em> has been included in the IUCN Red List since 1982, where its 'Vulnerable' status reflected a widespread concern about the environmentally destructive development of the Ryukyu Islands and the growing number of threats to the ecosystems and endemic species of Iriomote and other islands in this region. In 1978, these concerns led to the passing of a resolution at the 14th IUCN General Assembly in Ashkhabad, which called upon the Government of Japan to take immediate steps to ensure the conservation of Iriomote Island and its endemic taxa, and for the subsequent designation of the whole of the Nansei Shoto Region (often referred to as the 'Galápagos of the East' on account of the high percent endemicity of its fauna and flora) as a bio-geographical priority region in the World Conservation Strategy. In 1982, the 'Nansei Shoto Conservation Project' was launched by WWF-Japan, with initial emphasis being placed on the conduct of wildlife and socio-economic surveys on Iriomote and Amami Oshima (Obara 1984a, 1984b). In the interim, however, the desired increased protection of the Nansei Shoto Region was clearly at odds with the Japanese Government's regional policies, and the development of the islands continued - a circumstance which led to the passage of a another resolution, highlighting Japan's treatment of the region, at the 16th General Assembly of IUCN in Costa Rica in 1986. This also appears to have had little affect, as evinced by further major development plans, including the controversial Ishigaki Airport extension, and recent plans to construct a new dam and road on Iriomote Island. Although one third of Iriomote has been designated as a national park, the proposed road will cut through the park and will also increase access by poachers who have already reduced the wild pig to less than half of its numbers before the park was created (Brazil 1988). <br/><br/>Of all wild pigs species, <em>S. scrofa</em> is by far the most widely maintained and bred in captivity, though general perceptions about the relative abundance of this species has resulted in diminished interest in its propagation. Many zoos, particularly in western Europe, have therefore disposed of their stocks of these animals, mostly to 'wild boar breeding farms', which have escalated in number to meet growing demands in the gourmet meat markets and for commercial diversification. In addition, increasingly restrictive quarantine and other veterinary regulations appertaining to the international movements of all live suids, has made it extremely difficult to establish new breeding programs.<br/><br/>Contrarily, since these animals are most easily acquired in their countries of origin, local stocks are most likely to be pure-bred and, hence, most valuable for research and conservation purposes. In this situation, priority should be given to the establishment of national or regional breeding programmes for each of the rarest subspecies, especially <em>S. s. riukiuanus</em>.<br/><br/>As a general rule, <em>S. scrofa</em> is both highly adaptable and highly resistant to a variety of degradative processes, and may thrive under conditions of habitat modification and hunting pressure which have devastated other forms of wildlife. In addition, most subspecies are well represented in protected areas in their relatively extensive ranges. Nonetheless, there are reasons for concern about a number of distinct populations of <em>S. scrofa</em>, of which the Ryukyu pigs are undoubtedly the most seriously threatened. Indeed, <em>riukiuanus</em> is the only subspecies of <em>S. scrofa</em> to be included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals (IUCN 1990), where it has been accorded the status of 'Vulnerable' since 1982, but is already thought to be 'Endangered' on at least four of the six islands in the Ryukyu Chain which constitute its entire, and therefore extremely restricted, range. This particular form is also the most distinct, and (with an average adult male body weight of only about 45 kg; Barber <em>et al</em>. 1984) by far the smallest, subspecies. It is therefore of some interest as a potential genetic resource, as well as being one of the principal 'flagship' animals for increased conservation activity in the crucially important Nansei Shoto Region. For all of these reasons, the following recommendations (taken from Oliver <em>et al</em> 1993) are mostly confined to the immediate and longer-term management requirements of this taxon.<br/><br/><strong>Objectives</strong><ol><li>To promote local interest in, and the enhanced future protection and management of, the Ryukyu Islands' dwarf wild pig, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. riukiuanus</span>, and any other threatened native subspecies may be identified in the future;</li><li>To promote further applied research on the taxonomy, distribution, conservation status and biology of the species, particularly the least known forms;</li><li>To discourage any future releases of any specimens of any subspecies of this species, or its domestic and feral derivatives, outside their known former ranges, and encourage the eradication or control of such introduced populations as may exist at present;</li><li>To investigate the cultural and economic significance of these animals to local people, particularly in southeast Asia, and their potential genetic importance in terms of: a) possibilities for their further domestication and/or b) an enhanced understanding of the origins and relationships of present day domestic and wild populations</li></ol><strong>Priority Projects</strong><br/><ol><li>Provide all appropriate support to any existing or proposed future conservation initiatives in the Nansei Shoto Region, relevant to the enhanced future management and protection of the Ryukyu Island's dwarf wild pig, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. riukiuanus</span>. </li><li>Conduct (preliminary or repeat) status surveys on all (six) islands in the Ryukyu Group known to support remnant populations of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. riukiuanus</span> (i.e. Iriomote, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Tokunoshima, Amamioshima and Kakerome), and implement emergent recommendations.</li><li>Promote development of a coordinated breeding programmed for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. s. riukiuanus</span><em>,</em> both nationally and internationally<em>.</em></li><li>Collect, evaluate and disseminate data on the taxonomic relationships, distribution and conservation status of other, less-known forms, with a view to the resolution of certain outstanding taxonomic problems and the development of recommendations for their enhanced future protection, if so required.

Population declines are estimated to be greater than 50% in the past three generation (33 years) mainly due to habitat loss and hunting.&#160; It is estimated that around 70% of Central American forest areas have been lost through deforestation and alteration over the last 40 years (Primack <em>et al.</em> 1997), in addition the species has been consistently hunted throughout most its range. We therefore estimate that the population has declined by well over 50% in the past three generations. Causes of past population reduction have not ceased. It is suspected that in next three generations the population will decline by a further 70% from loss of habitat, fragmentation and hunting pressure. Range-wide habitat change is severely impacting and fragmenting populations of <em>T. bairdii</em>, which do not generally occupy human dominated or modified habitat types and suffers from persecution near human settlements. In addition there is evidence to suggest that infectious diseases may contribute to the decline of the species in the future as cases are now being found in the northern portion of the range where cattle are present. Outbreaks of disease have been reported in Guatemala and Costa Rica. The construction of a road through the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala and in other regions is likely to become a major problem for tapirs in that area. The construction of mega infrastructure (highways, dams, interoceanic canal) in different countries threatens the species, and may create additional genetic barriers. Finally severe droughts potentially as a result of climate change may have a future impact on tapir populations on the Selva Maya.<br/><br/>Main threats in the northern region include habitat loss due to expanding agriculture, livestock, and mega-infrastructure; climate change; road kills; and hunting. Main threats in the central region include habitat loss due to expanding agriculture, livestock, and mega-infrastructure (Petracca <em>et al.</em> 2014); other land use change; and hunting (Jordan <em>et al.</em> 2014). Main threats in the southern region include habitat loss due to expanding agriculture, livestock, and mega-infrastructure; hunting; and fires (Cove <em>et al</em>. 2013). The current overall population estimate for mature individuals of this species is suspected to be close to 3,000. If trends persist and conservation action not taken&#160; <em>T. bairdii</em> may become Critically Endangered in the near future with declines of over 80% of the total population being suspected.&#160; </p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Baird’s Tapir is found in forested areas with ponds and streams (wet tropical rainforest, tropical subdeciduous forest and montane cloud forests), palm swamps, paramo, mangrove, riparian forest, and successional vegetation (caused by natural disturbances), as well as in narrow oak- forest strips covering the top of medium-altitude mountains; from sea level to 3,620 m (Brooks <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Naranjo and Vaughan 2000).</p>","<p>The main factors of Baird’s population decline remain habitat destruction and localized hunting (Castellanos <em>et al.</em> 2008, Brooks&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997).&#160; The species low reproductive rate makes it more vulnerable to these threats (Brooks<em> et al</em>.&#160;1997).<br/><br/>Between 2001 and 2010, Mexico and Central America experienced a net loss of 179,405 km2 of forested habitats, correlated with the gain of mixed woody/plantation and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation; the Maya Forest in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala, and the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua had the greatest deforestation rates during this period (Aide <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160; Deforestation not only reduces forest extensions but also changes their spatial patterns, resulting in fragmented habitat and genetically isolated tapir populations.&#160; The Nicaragua population is highly threatened by continued high rates of deforestation in its Biosphere Reserves and other protected areas (C. Jordan pers. comm.). <br/><br/>In the last years, the increasing of Palm oil plantations through the species distribution is becoming an relevant threat in the region.<br/><br/>Hunting has been reported to have a notable effect in some tapir populations, significantly increasing their chance of becoming extinct in the short term where pressure is high (Castellanos <em>et al.</em> 2008, García <em>et al</em>. 2010, McCann <em>et al.</em> 2011). Where hunting pressure is low it might not drive populations to extinction (Dunn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). In recent years, hunting has been reported in Guatemala (García <em>et al.</em> 2010), Honduras (Dunn <em>et al. </em>2011, McCann <em>et al.</em> 2012) and Nicaragua (Koster 2007, Jordan <em>et al.</em> 2014); and previously in Costa Rica (Castellanos <em>et al.</em> 2008). Sport hunting has been previously reported in Costa Rica (Castellanos <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Other threats include disease transmission to wild tapirs coexisting with domestic animals (Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2006); road kill in Yucatán, Mexico (Contreras-Moreno <em>et al.</em> 2013); fire events were documented in Mexico; young tapirs captured to be trade as pets; and a new threat reported in Mexico, disoriented tapirs with abnormal behavior (might be due to diseases) killed or captured in human settlements (G. O’Farrill pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There is particular concern that climate change will increase the severity of droughts in Mexico’s Calakmul Reserve and result in a steep decline of tapirs in the Northern Region that could affect the conservation of Baird’s Tapirs throughout their range (O’Farrill <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In Belize, continual fragmentation of the Selva Maya are threatening Baird’s tapir populations in northern Central America.  This is particularly the case in the area where the Chalillo Dam is being built and tapirs are being illegally hunted to feed construction workers (S. Matola pers. comm.).  In Panama, major threats seem to be hunting and habitat loss.</p>","<p>There are recent reports of Baird's Tapir population in the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua (Jordan <em>et al. </em>2010) and Panama (Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2013) where population's status were unconfirmed or thought to be extinct. Despite these new records, populations of this species are expected to be in a continuing decline due to the existing threats in the region. Also, a new report reveals the extreme rarity of the species in central Panama where it was thought to be resident (N. Meyer pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Although some recent estimates suggest there may be a higher number of individual in certain countries, we believe the total population estimate from prior assessments is significantly overestimated.<br/><br/>The Mosquitia area of Honduras and Nicaragua is particularly important because of its large size and low human population density, though tapir density may be low due to the presence of hunters throughout the region. This region may contain 500-600 mature individual.<br/><br/>Although it was suggested that the species still persisted in El Salvador at some level (Sanchez-Nuñez <em>et al</em>. 2007), there haven't been recent publications with new records. The forest of Indio-Maiz, Costa Rica, and Panama may contain a population of approximately 600-800 mature individuals. The remaining mature individuals are primarily in small, isolated forest remnants that are unlikely to be connected to these core areas. In the Maya Forest of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala may contain viable population, previously estimated of about 1,000-1,500 individuals.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Baird's Tapir (<em>Tapirus bairdii) </em>is known to occur in Southern Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, southern Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Republic of Panama, north-western Colombia (Chocò and Darien regions)(Restrepo and Betancourt 2008), and historically in El Salvador. Its current or historical presence is still uncertain in Ecuador.&#160;In Mexico,&#160;the Baird's Tapir is present in the following localities: Campeche, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo and potentially in Veracruz, Yucatan and Tabasco. In Belize <em>T. bairdii </em>is present in all districts while in Guatemala is present in the Department of Izabal, Petén, Alta Verapaz and Quiché, and in the Biosphere Reserve of Sienna de las Minas. In Honduras is present in several localities in the Department of Atlàntida, Cortés, El Paraiso, Gracias a Dios, Olancho and Yoro. In Nicaragua the Baird's Tapir is limited primarily to Caribbean Coast lowland tropical fortest, swamps, and seasonally flooded forests, the San Juan River, and the Bosawàs Biosphere Reserve. In Costa Rica is present in the three mountain ranges and main protected areas in lowlands (Castellanos <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Baird's Tapir is recorded in Republic of Panama in the provinces of Chiriqui, Bocas del Toro, Veraguas, Coclé, Colon, Panama, Guna Yala and Darién, and to sum up to the forests along the Atlantic coast.<br/><br/>Forest cover and preliminary habitat distribution models suggest that there exist three core areas for Baird’s Tapirs that are geographically separated.&#160; Given the high levels of habitat destruction throughout the Baird’s Tapir’s range, we believe it is crucial to highlight these three core areas as the top conservation priorities for ensuring the survival of Baird’s Tapirs.<br/><br/>Regions: North (Mexico, Guatemala and Belize), Central (Honduras and Nicaragua), and South (Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panamá and Colombia).</p><p>  <br/></p><p><br/></p>",This species is hunted locally for food and to be trade as pets.

There are also important suitable habitat patches with no protected status in Mexico (Mendoza <em>et al.</em> 2012), Belize (Waters&#160;and Ulloa 2007), Guatemala and Nicaragua, and possibly in the other countries.<br/><br/>Regionally considered under CITES Appendix I. Protected nationally throughout its range, however, these laws are often not enforced in many areas (Brooks <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997).<br/><br/>Mexico has developed the Baird’s Tapirs “Programa de Acción de Conservación de Especie” (Specie’s conservation action plan), with objectives related to the conservation of habitats and populations, as well as research and conservation goals.<br/><br/>Honduras developed the “Plan Nacional para la conservación del danto (<em>Tapirus bairdii</em>) en Honduras” (National Plan for Baird’s Tapir conservation in Honduras) which includes 4 action lines: habitat and wild populations conservation, <em>ex situ</em> conservation, environmental education, and governance and citizen participation.<br/><br/>Parts of the Baird’s Tapir’s range is uncertain.

45173636,21472,Tapirus indicus,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd; C1,2016,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Endangered due to a past and ongoing population decline estimated from loss of available habitat, fragmentation of remaining habitat and increasing loss of individuals due to hunting, road-kills and bi-catches by snare hunters. Population declines are estimated to have been greater than 50% in the past three generations (36 years) driven primarily by large scale conversion of tapir habitat to palm oil plantations and other human dominated land-use. The rate of reduction in population is inferred to be proportional to the reduction of the tropical rainforest area in southeast Asia over the same period. However the population decline is estimated to be even higher due to indirect threats (roads, hunting). Furthermore there are estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next two generations (24 years).<br/><br/>Most remaining populations are isolated in existing protected areas and forest fragments, which are discontinuous and offer little ability for genetic exchange for these browsers. This situation is particularly relevant for the Thai/Myanmar populations and to a lesser extent for the Southern Thailand and Malaysia landscape.<br/><br/>This situation is expected to continue at a slightly diminishing rate in the future as non-protected areas, which are available as logging concessions, become less available. Because hunting seems to be increasing for tapir throughout the range - this could be cause for concern in the future as already reduced and isolated subpopulations would be at great risk for extirpation.<br/><br/>Threats due to habitat destruction and hunting in Myanmar/Thailand appear to be minimal, because most of the population occurs in well protected national parks and reserves. The main threat to the Thailand/Myanmar population is likely related to negative effects of inbreeding in small isolated populations. The situation is similar in Malaysia, although the population sustains a higher risk of habitat fragmentation and, subsequently, inbreeding risks as well as increased changes of mortal displacement. Despite having developed a National Tapir Action Plan (2013) the decline of the Sumatra population has not yet been arrested, and it remains under serious threat from habitat destruction and accidental capture in illegally set snares.</p>","<p><em>T. indicus</em> is restricted to tropical moist forest areas and occurs in both primary and secondary forest and wetland areas. The more seasonal climate in northern Myanmar, northern (= most of non-peninsula) Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia and the harsher dry season of the forest (even in evergreen areas, excepting the eastern flanks and adjacent Vietnamese lowlands of the Annamite chain) there is likely to be the main reason this species is not found there. The Malay Tapir is also predominantly found in the lowlands and the lower montane zone in some parts of the range, although it remains common to the highest peaks in its Thai range (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also recorded frequently above 1,600 m in Taman Negara National Park and Krau Wildlife Reserve, Malaysia, as well as at 2,000 m in Kerinci Sebelat National Park, Sumatra (Holden <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>Malay Tapirs are solitary animals that are usually nocturnal (Traeholt and Sanusi 2009, Traeholt unpubl. data). It is a browser that feeds on more than 380 different species, often breaking 8-10 m tall trees to access the leaves (Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are not considered good seed disperser because they tend to chew all seeds and browse consumed (Campos-Arceiz <em>et al.</em> 2012, Zainuddin <em>et al.</em> 2000). It gives birth to one calf after 11-13 months gestation period, with the calf remaining with the female for up to two years. The World’s first and only twin-birth record of a Malay tapir took place in Sg Dusun Tapir Conservation Centre, Malaysia, in 2009 (DWNP unpubl. data), however twin birth has never been recorded in the wild. The time between the births of the calves was 12.5 days, which suggests that Malay tapir may have the ability for delayed pregnancy.</p>","<p><em>Tapirus indicus</em> is threatened throughout most of its range. The primary threats to the species are large scale deforestation and increasingly, hunting. Tapir population have declined by well over 50% in Thailand and Malaysia, whereas it is suspected to be slightly less than 50% in Sumatra. The main reason for declines in the past is habitat conversion, with large tracts land being converted into palm oil plantations. However, increasingly as other large 'prey"" species decline in the area hunters are beginning to look towards tapir as a food source.<br/><br/>Destruction of habitat is the main threat to the species throughout its entire range. Whereas recent research suggests that tapirs are not necessarily affected negatively by illegal logging activities (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2012, Traeholt unpubl. data) forest conservation to monocrop plantations such as palm oil has devastating effects on tapirs. Magintan <em>et al.</em> (2012) recorded a strong correlation between the increases in road-kills and plantation development. In Thailand, most remaining intact forest now lies within protected areas, with mostly degraded lands outside. Myanmar's protected areas make up approx. 5% of land area (Shwe) and most tapir habitat lies outside these protected areas. Large-scale habitat destruction has continued in Sumatra, and most remaining habitat in central Sumatra is outside protected areas (Novarino). The population decline in Sumatra is believed to be caused primarily because of the onslaught on suitable habitat. However, the rate of decline seems to diminish during the 2010-2014 period compared to the 2004-2009 period. It is likely correlated with the increasing Global demand for “sustainably” produced palm oil, as well as a US$ 1 Billion REDD-grant provided by&#160; Norway to Indonesia.<br/><br/><em>Tapirus indicus</em> are shy animals and appear to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation.  In Halabala Wildlife Sanctuary on the Thai-Malaysia border, Kaewsirisuk (2001) found that the species does not venture within a few hundred meters of forest-plantation edges.  At Khao Sok National Park, tapirs are interior forest species that avoid forest edges (Lynam 1996). Kawanishi (2002), however, found in Taman Negara, the largest national park in Malaysia, that although the human traffic level was heavier in area closer to the park boundary, tapirs showed no edge effects.  While forest loss continues in Thailand, forests in protected areas remain relatively stable in size and composition to other countries because of a ban on commercial logging that has been in place since 1989.  For this reason, while tapirs may indeed be threatened in general by forest loss, populations in Thailand and Malaysia are probably more stable. <br/><br/>In Malaysia the current forestry trend seems to be stabilized at approx. 43% remaining forest cover (57% lost), of which at least half can be considered tapir habitat. In Thailand, 40% of the remaining forest is outside protected areas and only 5% of Myanmar's land area is protected forest (Lynam pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species has uncertain status and future in Myanmar due to security issues and forest clearance for rubber and oil palm plantations.  However, two new protected areas have been designated in the Tenasserims: Taninthayi National Park and Lenya River Wildlife Sanctuary.  If these areas can be protected, they will preserve valuable tapir habitat in the future.<br/><br/>Malay Tapirs are generally not hunted for subsistence or commercial trade in Thailand or Myanmar, since their flesh is considered distasteful. Some hill tribes believe that killing a tapir brings bad luck. In Malaysia deliberate hunting of Malay Tapir for consumption is also rare, because consuming the species is considered “forbidden” by the national Islamic authority. However, most illegal poachers apprehended in Malaysia are from Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand (DWNP unpub. report), and it remains unknown to what extent that they hunt tapirs for consumption and/or other reasons. Previous reported practices in Sumatra of live tapirs being traded through several Indonesian zoos, some destined for private collections or for sale as meat in local markets, seems to have been halted with no new known since 2008 (Novarino pers. comm).</p>","<p>The Malay Tapir occurs in three relatively distinct and, in a few cases, isolated populations - two occurring on mainland Southeast Asia (Thailand/Myanmar), Southern Thailand/Malaysia and the other the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. The population on Sumatra continues to decline due to extensive loss of habitat, accidental and deliberate trapping for meat and removal of animals for zoos in Indonesia. To date, there are no reliable population estimates for Sumatra.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Sumatra, Indonesia</strong><br/>In Sumatra, Indonesia, over 50% of the remaining forest is outside Malay Tapir habitat. The concern that illegal logging and forest encroachment would result in the loss of all forest outside conservation areas by 2005 does not seem to hold up, and large tracts of tapir habitat still persists in Sumatra. Yet, Novarino maintains that habitat destruction has continued significantly in the 2008-2014 period in Sumatra, both inside and outside protected areas. Localized hunting in Sumatra also occurs as well as elsewhere in its distribution range, but there is no evidence of systematic activities targeting the species. Most off-take results from accidental snaring, road kills (Magintan <em>et al.</em> 2012) and retaliation killing by local villagers (Novarino pers. comm.). In the past, several Indonesian zoos, especially Pekanbaru, traded in live tapirs for sale to other Indonesian zoos or private collections, or for sale as meat in local markets. Fifty tapirs were reported passing through the Pekanbaru Zoo since 1993 with some of these animals likely to have originated from protected areas. While impossible to confirm, this practice appears to have been greatly reduced, possibly as a result of Indonesia’s economic prosperity and bigger awareness among local communities. In addition, the formation of organizations such as the Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has resulted in a large portion of the palm oil industry committing to protecting and managing high conservation value areas, rather than to convert it all to agricultural land. This has reduced the speed of habitat conversion, and in some places even reversed it due to RSPO-principles that require members to rehabilitate HCV-areas that were destroyed post 2005. Whereas the threat status for the species has not changed notably in the 2008-2014 period there is far better understanding of what causes the population decline. There exists no accurate population estimate of tapirs in Sumatra, but it is anticipated to be below 400-500 adult individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Thailand and Myanmar</strong><br/>In Thailand, 40% of the remaining forest is outside protected areas and only 5% of Myanmar’s land area is protected forest (Lynam pers. comm.). Lynam’s comments on tapir status and distribution in Thailand and Myanmar remain relevant in 2014. Thailand supports one of the most comprehensive systems of protected areas in Southeast Asia. Over 200 National Parks, Marine National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries and Non-hunting areas cover 17% of land area (Prayurasiddhi <em>et al.</em> 1999).&#160; Almost all-remaining intact forest now lies within protected areas, with mostly degraded lands outside. Since most existing Malay Tapir habitat is already protected, the future for conservation of the species in Thailand is quite positive. In Thailand,<em> Tapirus indicus</em> is recorded from forest areas in the west and south of the country (Lekagul and McNeely 1988), including transboundary forest areas in border areas, and large isolated forest remnants. The transboundary forests represent the most extensive, contiguous habitats for large mammals left in the country (Prayurasiddhi <em>et al.</em> 1999). They include the Western Forest Complex (Thai-Myanmar border), which includes 12 protected areas, and covers over 18,730 km<sup>2</sup> including both dry and wet forests, and the Kaeng Krachan/Chumpol complex which covers 4,373 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly wet evergreen forest on the Thai-Myanmar border. The Halabala Forest is an expanse of 1,850 km<sup>2</sup> of tropical rainforest on the Thai-Malaysia border. All areas are contiguous with larger forest areas on opposite sides of the country border. Past surveys (Lynam 1999, Lynam 2000, WCS 2001, Kaewsirisuk 2001) confirmed that tapirs are present though uncommon in each of these transboundary forest areas.<br/><br/>While the Thai-Myanmar population apparently remains stable (Lynam pers. comm.) it is fragmented with many subpopulations often numbering less than 15 individuals which are not viable populations for the long term. Therefore, Thai populations are fragile with most subpopulations are unlikely to reach more than 50-100 individuals at the most. The smaller fragmented populations with only 10-15 individuals are left with no chance of linking up to other protected areas and suitable habitats. This is not genetically sustainable, but management intervention (e.g. moving individuals to supplement new genes) can suppress the risk of inbreeding. To date, no reliable population estimate exists for the Thailand/Myanmar population, although it is anticipated to be less than 250 adult individuals. Therefore, the long-term survival of Malay Tapirs&#160;in Thailand seems to be dependent primarily by proper meta-population management.<br/><br/>Myanmar’s protected areas make up 5% of land area (Shwe) and most tapir habitat lies outside these protected areas in part of the Thai isthmus. In Myanmar, Malay Tapirs are entirely restricted to rainforests in the Tenasserim Ranges along the Thai-Myanmar border (Yin 1993). The tenure of these lands on the Myanmar side of the border is disputed and due to civil unrest, has been inaccessible for wildlife survey until recently. However, a preliminary survey of the status and threats to Malay Tapirs&#160;were undertaken in Taninthayi nature reserve and tapirs were recorded regularly (Shwe and Lynam 2012). Furthermore, a rapid assessment for Malay Tapir in five townships of the Taninthayi range and vicinity was undertaken too (Shwe unpubl. data). The Taninthayi population forms part of the Thai transboundary population, hence it is not possible to separate the Thai and Myanmar populations into two distinct populations.<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia and Southern Thailand</strong><br/>The tapir population in Malaysia and Southern Thailand is considered the largest and most resilient. To date, it is also the best studied. Despite a significant population “decline” in the previous assessment (from ~20,000 to less than 2,000) several recent studies using various methodologies concur that the population in Malaysia ranges from approximately 1,300-1,700 individuals (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2012, Rayan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Traeholt and Sanusi 2009). This confirms that the previous estimate of approx. 20,000 individuals was a technical overestimate as there has likely never been that many in the past either. Monitoring of the population by the Malaysian Department of Wildlife and National Parks reiterates that the population appears to be stable.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, tapirs are found in virtually all types of forest: primary, logged, disturbed and small pockets. Sometimes it even ventures into plantations and urban areas although this seems to be caused by basic wandering or possibly displaced by rival individuals. Whereas habitat loss to agricultural development is still ongoing, illegal logging and disturbance of primary rainforest does not seem to cause any significant problems to tapirs, because they seem to prefer more open areas with more browse available. The rate of habitat loss has decreased and the current forest coverage (45%) is likely to remain stable for the near future. To date, there is no evidence of targeted hunting activities. First of all, the number of displaced animals (displaced animals are animals that come out of forested areas and into villages, plantations, roads and most often end up dead or severely injured)&#160; from 2006-2010 reached 142 individuals (average of &gt;3 deaths per year) with most being returned to the wild, and 17 died (Magintan <em>et al</em>. 2012). The trend is increasing with 54 recorded displacements with 19 mortalities in the 2011-2013 period (an average of &gt;6 deaths per year). The cause of the increasing “displacements” remains poorly understood. Second, the southern part of the distribution range is effectively isolated and despite the Federal Governments intentions to create a “Central Forest Spine” that connects the main conservation landscapes in the country, all indications suggest that forest complexes in the southern state of Johor are becoming increasingly isolated with diminishing chances of ever forming a part of the Central Forest Spine. In the southern states of Malaysia (Johor, Nengri Sembilan and Southern part of Selangor) there are an increasing number of small forest fragments with only 3-5 individuals - they are functionally extinct. Finally, systematic hunting activities can decimate the population in a very short time, and with the supply of rhino horns running dry, there is a very real risk that hunters will begin targeting Malay tapirs and sold as “placebo rhino”.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Tapirus indicus</em> occurs in southern and central parts of Sumatra (Indonesia), and on the Asian mainland in Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand (along the western border and on the Peninsula south to the Malaysian border, and in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in the north), and Myanmar (south of latitude 18°N). Its occurrence can be divided into three relatively distinct sub-populations:</p><ol><li>Thailand-Myanmar that includes all the trans-boundary forest complexes and protected areas in the western Thailand north to Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary.</li><li>South Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia that includes the transboundary protected areas complex of Halabala (Thailand) and Royal Belum (Malaysia) and constitutes a relatively cohesive mega population, albeit fragmentation into smaller sub-populations occurs in the southern part of its distribution range in the state of Johor.</li><li>Sumatra including southern and central parts. The Sumatran distribution range is becoming increasingly fragmented.</li></ol><p><br/>The Malay Tapir was also listed as occurring in southern Cambodia and possibly southern Viet Nam by Brooks <em>et al.</em> (1997). It was reported from Hongquan district, eastern Cochin China, Viet Nam, in 1944 (Harper 1945), and there was an authentic-sounding record from Lao PDR in 1902 (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). It is presumed to be extinct in all three countries. However, further investigation of these historical records and of other indications from Lao, Viet Nam, Cambodia, northern Thailand and even southern China have found none that has any compelling evidence in its support. The species' habitat distribution at the northern edge of its Thai range, where the climate develops a more marked dry season, and the tapir occupancy changes from altitudinal wide-ranging to being restricted to the most humid altitudes, strongly supports a climatic limitation (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2012, Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2008), thereby casting further empirical doubt on the 20th century reports from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia. Cranbrook and Piper (2009) reported that Malay Tapirs existed until very recently in Sabah (Borneo) and suggested reintroduction of the species into Sabah should be considered in the future (Cranbrook 2012).<br/></p>",Tapir meat is occasionally eaten and sold in local markets.

45176206,2963,Brachylagus idahoensis,Least Concern,,2016,2016-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The population status of <em>Brachylagus idahoensis </em>is extremely varied across its discontinuous range, and its dependence on big sagebrush makes it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss from rangeland conversion and fire, and the resulting fragmentation often leads to decreased genetic diversity within populations (Dobler and Dixon 1990). The extirpated Columbia Basin population is being re-introduced. However, there are several robust populations in less disturbed areas, and suitable habitat still exists in many areas.","<strong>General</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> mainly occupies big sagebrush (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em>), especially where the vegetation is very dense. It forms burrows in soft, deep soils, in areas such as alluvial fans, often burrowing into a slope or rise in land elevation (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/>As observed in captivity, free-ranging females construct natal burrows that are separate from residential burrow systems. The natal burrows have a single entrance leading to a nest chamber. Entrances to natal burrows are backfilled with soil and often are located at the base of shrubs (Rachlow <em>et al.</em> in prep). Preliminary observations based on radio-telemetry in the Lemhi Valley, Idaho, suggest that <em>B. idahoensis</em> moves longer distances than previously documented (more than 7 km for adults, and more than 6 km for juvenile rabbits) (Rachlow <em>et al</em>. in prep).<br/><br/><em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is preyed upon by coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), badgers (<em>Taxidea taxus</em>), weasels (<em>Mustela frenata</em>), bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), great horned owls (<em>Bubo virginianus</em>), long-eared owls (<em>Asio otus</em>), northern harriers (<em>Circus cyaneus</em>) (Dobler and Dixon 1990) and red foxes (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) (Green and Flinders 1980).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: In Wyoming, <em>B. idahoensis</em> appears to follow the general accepted patterns of habitat use: an affinity for tall and dense sagebrush growing on friable soils. A few documented observations are from areas with only short and sparse sagebrush; there is some speculation (and only speculation) that <em>B. idahoensis</em> can occupy this type of habitat when wind is persistent enough to keep even short sagebrush exposed in the winter (i.e. the true habitat requirement is sagebrush exposed in winter, which in most areas is tall sagebrush, but in a few windy sites may be otherwise). Alternatively, these observations may represent juveniles dispersing through non-typical environments. In landscapes where short and sparse sagebrush is the matrix surrounding island patches of tall and dense sagebrush, <em>B. idahoensis</em> can be reliably found in the islands. Several field workers in south-west Wyoming have independently remarked that <em>B. idahoensis</em> tends to be most frequently found in an elevation band from approximately 6,500-7,500 ft (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> in Nevada seems to have similar habitat preferences as rabbits found in other states. They require loamy soils with big sagebrush. They can be located throughout entire valleys, but when not, they generally tend to be found in the largest, most dense clumps of sagebrush on appropriate soils. They have been located in areas with practically no understory (example: Reese Valley) as well as in areas with a heavy understory of forbs and bunch grasses (Sheldon Preserve). There may be competition between <em>B. idahoensis</em> and cottontail rabbits. Areas with high understory often have both rabbit types while areas with moderate understory only have cottontails. These cottontails have been found to be living in burrows that may have originally been made by <em>B. idahoensis</em>. In areas with practically no understory, <em>B. idahoensis</em> has been found with no cottontails (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>California</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> in California has similar habitat requirements to those in Nevada. However, the rabbits around Mono Lake are found in soils that have a higher sand content than populations found in Nevada. They are often found in ""loamier"" inclusions in stabilized sand dunes. Also, the rabbits in the Bodie area live at very high elevations (8,400+ ft). These rabbits are found in loamy soils in relatively low sagebrush (about 2-3 ft). They are still more likely to be found in the largest and densest sagebrush in the area (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: Habitat use by <em>B. idahoensis</em> as inferred from burrow placement and distribution of pellets indicates preferential use of the densest patches of sagebrush available on the landscape. Use of sagebrush species (<em>Artemisia tridentata tridentata, A. t.vaseyana, A. t. wyomingensis</em>, and <em>Artemisia arbuscula</em>) and heights (30-60 cm) varies considerably with elevation and latitude. It should also be noted that numerous sites considered by range specialists to be ""overgrazed"" (maintains its sagebrush over story, but exhibits substantial loss of grass and forb understory) contained large numbers of <em>B. idahoensis</em>. This, combined with their use of roadsides and disturbed edge, indicated that rabbits in Utah seem relatively flexible in their use of habitat, given sagebrush maintains proper canopy cover. Extensive snow tracking has been conducted in populations of the Wyoming Basin (Rich County). Initial analysis of non-dispersal movements indicated regular movements of 0.5-1.0 km within the first six hours after a fresh snowfall (Kozlowski 2004).","<strong>General</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is dependent on big sagebrush (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em>), it is particularly sensitive to habitat loss. Fires that are more frequent due to the increase of invasive cheatgrass, conversion to cropland and rangeland are contributors to loss of sagebrush habitat. Isolation of populations due to fragmentation of suitable habitat cause bottlenecks that threaten subpopulations. Dispersal is limited in fragmented populations, because <em>B. idahoensis</em> will not cross large open areas (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/><strong>Washington</strong>: In Washington, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is threatened by loss of deep soil shrub-steppe habitat, increase in fire frequencies due to cheatgrass invasion. Fires have the potential to remove sagebrush from vast areas. A recent fire in Washington State burned 66,000 hectares just outside the historic range of <em>B. idahoensis</em>. There are 417,000 hectares within the historic range of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Washington with soil types where rabbits have been located. Of that amount, 27,000 acres remain in shrub-steppe today, and much of that has been degraded through fire and agricultural practices. Change in abundance and foraging of native predators due to habitat change are potential threats range wide that are largely unstudied (Hays 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: Although cheatgrass is not yet a major problem in southwest Wyoming, it is thought to be only a matter of time before it begins to dominate here as it has in states to the west. Also petroleum exploration and development is expected to increase markedly here, with consequent increase in sagebrush removal, alteration of fire cycles, increased road density, and increased potential for cheatgrass and other noxious weed establishment. Habitat managers appear to support more prescribed burning of tall and dense sagebrush, primarily to increase forage for big game and improve habitat for sage grouse. There is only occasional attention being paid to how this might harm <em>B. idahoensis</em>, as well as other vertebrates with similar habitat affinities (e.g. sage thrashers, sage sparrows). Heavy livestock grazing has the potential to reduce habitat quality for <em>B. idahoensis</em>, but it is important to recognize that southwest Wyoming was historically grazed by bison and white-tailed prairie dogs (<em>Cynomys leucurus</em>) with the latter species persisting into the present. Grazing by domestic sheep, cattle, horses, and feral horses occurs today, but was probably more intense and pervasive in the early 20th century and <em>B. idahoensis</em> are presumed to have persisted through that period. Disturbance of habitat in the vicinity of Bear Lake (ID) may reduce the already tentative connectivity between Wyoming populations and those to the west (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada </strong>and <strong>California</strong>: The main threat to <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Nevada and California is fragmentation due to vast fires. (These fires have extirpated populations from entire valleys and without leaving any cover behind may not allow rabbits to repopulate the area.) This is a severe problem that will most likely become greater with increasing cheatgrass invasion across Nevada. Agricultural fields are also a threat. Not only are they usually placed on the same loamy soils  the rabbits prefer, but they also create a potentially impassable barrier and may increase the habitat suitability for cottontails. Road systems may also be a larger barrier to dispersal that we may think. In night-time road transect surveys in areas with known ratios of jackrabbits/cottontails/<em>B. idahoensis</em>, <em>B. idahoensis</em> was consistently significantly under-represented. This may be due to their reluctance to cross open areas (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: Threats to <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Oregon include fire (natural and managed), flooding, conversion to agriculture, exotic plants, decadence and overgrazing. The accumulative effects of the threats have contributed to habitat fragmentation and the isolation of populations (Carey <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: The primary threat to <em>B. idahoensis</em> at this time is habitat loss. Loss occurs as a result of human development (historic losses: Wasatch Front north of Salt Lake; current losses: southwestern portion of the state in the vicinity of Cedar City), conversion to cultivated agriculture (northwestern portion of the Great Basin), degradation of plant communities due to overgrazing (widespread), increased fire frequency due to invasive weed understory (Great Basin), and large scale range improvement projects favouring the creation of large openings in mature sagebrush (Wyoming Basin, Lower Wasatch Range). As populations get smaller and more isolated, predators and disease may play more prominent roles as threats (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is threatened in Idaho by loss and/or modification of habitat including agricultural and urban development, invasive weeds, and changes in fire frequencies (Rachlow 2004b).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: Rauscher (1997) mentions fragmentation of <em>B. idahoensis</em> habitat resulting from projects to improve rangeland for cattle as a threat (sagebrush is removed). He qualified that by stating that the rabbit is somewhat resilient and has the ability to use sites that were previously disturbed.","<strong>Washington</strong>: The Columbia Basin population of <em>B. idahoensis</em> was extirpated as of 2004 (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007), and is federally listed as endangered. A captive population exists with 21 Columbia Basin specimens of <em>B. idahoensis</em> and 26 rabbits crossed and backcrossed with <em>B. idahoensis</em> from Idaho (Hays 2004). Specimens taken to establish founding population for reintroduction had low reproductivity and high disease susceptibility, probably as a result of inbreeding depression. Intercrossing with <em>B. idahoensis</em> from Idaho was successful in restoring genetic diversity and increasing reproductive levels (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007). In March 2007, 20 rabbits were released as part of a reintroduction program in Douglas County, Washington (Oregon Zoo 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD; University of Wyoming) has on file 93 records of <em>B. idahoensis</em> observations documented in Wyoming. Very few populations have been studied enough to draw reliable conclusions as to size or trend. The population at Fossil Butte National Monument as been studied at various times in the past, and appears to be rather abundant and persistent. In general, field biologists with good knowledge of <em>B. idahoensis</em> habitat can find individuals with relative ease within the known range of the species in Wyoming. In 2003, WYNDD biologists surveyed two areas outside of known range in the state; <em>B. idahoensis</em> was documented at one of these sites (Sweetwater River watershed, described above). Appropriate habitat is rather abundant and contiguous in southwest Wyoming; cheatgrass has not impacted this area to any great degree (yet) (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada </strong>and <strong>California</strong>: Sizes of populations and abundances of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in an area vary. Certain populations in Nevada are composed of vast expanses of burrows. Other populations may include only one burrow system with only about two rabbits photographed at the site. However, we do not know how far these rabbits can disperse and so do not know what constitutes a single population. Once an area is found to contain <em>B. idahoensis</em>, they are often located throughout the valley in reasonable numbers. Fragmentation of populations is largely unknown since we do not know much about dispersal potential. Juvenile rabbits have been photographed in areas with no burrows, a long way from any known burrow sites. These rabbits may potentially be able to travel farther than we think as long as cover is provided. Fragmentation is a serious issue when fires or agricultural fields remove cover from vast areas (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: In 2000, a survey was conducted at 17 historical sites active in 1995 in southeast Oregon and only three sites contained evidence of current use by <em>B. idahoensis</em>. A 2001-2002 survey of 38 historical sites found evidence of recent use at only one location. However, recent surveys at new sites with habitat attributes preferred by <em>B. idahoensis</em> found evidence of rabbit use. On the Burns BLM district, 54 sites were surveyed and 12 sites showed signs of occupied rabbit use and undetermined use at eight sites (Carey <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: The more surveys that are conducted, the more rabbits are found. Populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in the Wyoming Basin, Great Basin, Colorado Basin, and Wasatch Mountains all appear to sustain habitat with robust numbers. It should be noted that to date, little to no attention has been paid to analyzing the density, genetic isolation, or trends of these populations (although surveys to increase our knowledge of these three issues are currently underway). It appears that the habitat that has remained intact since the last statewide examination of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in the 1940s also continues to maintain populations. Although it is clear that significant populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> (both in terms of area and numbers) still inhabit Utah, overall loss of habitat has occurred since the 1950s, rendering large portions of their historical range unsuitable (Eastern Box Elder County, Central Great Basin, Southwestern Utah) (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: Rauscher (1997) includes Horse Prairie, Big Sheep Creek, Sage Creek, Centennial Valley, the Sweetwater Basin, The Blacktail Wildlife Management Area, Antelope Flats, and the White Rocks as <em>B. idahoensis</em> range.<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: In Idaho, known populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> are highly fragmented, with the exception of the east-central valley region (Rachlow 2004b).",Unknown,"<strong>General</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> occurs throughout the Great Basin and neighbouring intermountain areas, in sagebrush habitat from southwestern Montana and western Wyoming in the east to southwestern Utah in the southeast and an isolated population, which is being reintroduced, in central Washington. The range also includes central Nevada to the north in eastern Oregon and southern Idaho (Dobler and Dixon 1990). Within this wide range, it occurs in patches correlating positively to the density of sagebrush (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/><strong>Washington</strong>: historically,  <em>B. idahoensis</em> occurred in many areas of the Columbia Basin, but the sagebrush habitat has been heavily overgrazed and cleared completely for agriculture in many places.  The population in Washington is now isolated from other populations (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: Known populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> are patchy but locally abundant in some areas within the valleys of the east-central region (Lemhi, Birch Creek, Big and Little Lost, and Pahsimeroi Valleys). Recently, isolated populations have been located in Owyhee County in the southwest of the state. Isolated populations also have been documented in the south-central region on the Camas Prairie (Rachlow 2004a).<br/><br/>An understanding of the current status and distribution of populations is limited by sampling effort; intensive surveys for populations have not been conducted in most areas. Within Idaho, agricultural and urban development of the Snake River Plains likely represents a significant barrier dividing populations north and south of the Snake River. Some populations north of the Snake River connect to those in southwestern Montana (including populations on the Continental Divide). South of the Snake River, populations likely connect to those in neighbouring states (Oregon, Nevada, and Wyoming). The Idaho Conservation Data Center (IDCDC) has approximately 180 records of the species in the program's geospatial database, comprising both recent and historical records of occurrence. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) recommends that the area of occupancy be computed by overlaying the distribution of known occurrences with a uniform grid and tallying the area of occupied grid cells. Using a 2-km grid, we calculated the area of occupancy to be 748 km² using IDCDC records. Two important sites are the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory (INEEL) and the Lemhi Valley, BLM lands south of Salmon, Idaho. Both areas have received significant research currently or in the past, and both support large populations of pygmy rabbits (Dixon and Bosworth 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> in Wyoming appears to be widespread throughout the sagebrush-dominated portions of the Bear and Green River Basins.  In the Bear River, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is consistently found in good numbers at Fossil Butte National Monument. In the Green River, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is consistently found to the south and west of the towns of Pinedale and Boulder. The species appears to be widespread in the western quarter of the Great Divide Basin as well. The Jack Morrow Hills are known to support several occurrences. There is a single occurrence in the Sweetwater River Basin, just across the divide from the Great Divide Basin, documented in 2003; this signals the need for more sampling in the Sweetwater to determine the actual distribution there. This is the only known occurrence of the species on the east side of the Continental Divide in Wyoming (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: The range of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Oregon has not been determined. Recent surveys have found rabbits in Lake, Harney, Malheur, and Deschutes counties. Known areas include Foster Flat, Warner Valley, and north of Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) (Carey <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: Occurrences of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Utah listed in Oliver (2004) have been augmented since the document's printing. Initial survey efforts have focused on the determining of presence or absence, but systematic searches in suitable habitat over large geographic ranges have given us a measure of relative densities. The top three most populous areas include the Western Box Elder County, Northern Rich County, and the Piute/North-western Garfield County. Within these areas, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is considered relatively common. The most notable absence of rabbits occurs throughout the central portion of Utah's Great Basin, which was included in historical estimates of the rabbit's statewide range (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>California</strong>:  They occur in Mono County California and are abundant from the Bodie Hills to south of Mono Lake.  No pygmy rabbits have been relocated to northern California but surveys are on going (Sequin 2004).  A recent survey found <em>B. idahoensis</em> present throughout the southern portion of its historic range in California, but did not find active sites in Modoc and Lassen counties in northern California (Larrucea and Brussard 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada</strong>: <em>B. idahoensis</em> is found from the state border in the north to the northern end of Nye and Lincoln Counties in the south and from the state border in the east to Vya, Nevada in the west.  The pygmy rabbit is still found in most of the higher intermountain regions in the Great Basin Desert of Nevada (Sequin 2004).  A recent survey found <em>B. idahoensis</em> present throughout the entire extent of its historic range in Nevada (Larrucea and Brussard 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: They are known from the extreme southwest corner of Montana: Dillon south to Idaho border (Hays 2004).","<strong>Washington</strong>: No take of&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;is occurring (no known wild animals); no take is legal (Hays 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: It is reasonable to assume that a few pygmy rabbits are killed each year by hunters who mistake them for cottontails. Although estimates have not been made, this is not suspected to be a large source of mortality (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada </strong>and <strong>California</strong>: Officially&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;is listed as a game species in both CA and NV. However it is not often hunted (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/>Oregon: There is no significant utilization of&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;except for some incidental hunting (Carey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Utah: Utilization of the&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;in Utah is low. Some incidental take may occur during the legal harvesting of cottontail species. Articles addressing this issue have been included in the state's Small Game Proclamation both to help mitigate direct mortality, but also facilitate the communication of additional distribution information (Kozlowski 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Idaho: Although previously classified as an upland game species, hunting was banned for&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;in Idaho in 2002. There may be incidental take of the species by hunters pursuing other lagomorphs (Rachlow 2004b).<br/><br/>Montana: No hunting season (Rauscher 1997).",Terrestrial,"<strong>General</strong>: Greater sage-grouse range overlaps with <em>B. idahoensis</em> range. Conservation of sage-grouse is a big issue and a federal listing may occur. Conservation of sage-grouse will likely benefit <em>B. idahoensis</em> to a significant degree. However, fire is being used to restore shrub-steppe and sage-grouse range in places, and although agencies are starting to include <em>B. idahoensis</em> in planning, it does not always happen (Hays 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Washington</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> from the Columbia Basin are federally listed as endangered. A recovery plan is being prepared, a captive breeding program is in place, habitat acquisition is proceeding, habitat management has changed, surveys have proceeded, reintroduction sites have been selected, and reintroduction techniques have been developed (Hays 2004). The reintroduction plan involves intercross breeding of <em>B. idahoensis</em> from the Columbia Basin with intraspecific rabbits from Idaho because of the bottleneck of genetic diversity caused by an extremely small population size (Sayler <em>et al.</em> 2007). The plan outlines reintroductions in 2007, followed by monitoring through the year for survival, dispersal, and reproductive success, and then a second reintroduction in early 2008 to augment the established population (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007). In March 2007, the first reintroduction of 20 rabbits bred by the Oregon Zoo were released in Douglas county, Washington, eight of which will be tracked by radio collar (Oregon Zoo 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: In Wyoming, <em>B. idahoensis</em> occurs on Fossil Butte National Monument; small population segments may extend onto Seedskadee and Bear River Meadows National Wildlife Refuges. These are all rather small and isolated protected areas. The vast majority of <em>B. idahoensis</em> populations in Wyoming occur on surfaces managed for multiple uses by the USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM). A lesser amount of state and private land within the BLM matrix also supports rabbits. The USDA Forest Service may manage some small population segments at the high-elevation periphery of the species distribution. B. idahoensis is on the Sensitive Species list of the Wyoming State Office of the BLM, which requires that agency to consider the effects of management actions on <em>B. idahoensis</em> (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada</strong>: There is increased awareness but otherwise no conservation actions for <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Nevada. <em>B. idahoensis </em>populations are located in the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge, as well as in the Great Basin National Park (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>California</strong>: <em>B. idahoensis</em> is located at Mono Lake and Bodie State Historic Park and receive protection in these areas (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: Surveys are being conducted throughout the historic range of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Oregon and additional surveys are planned for fall 2004 and 2005. A Master's student is studying habitat at Sheldon NWR. Also, a small telemetry project is underway. The BLM and Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge are now surveying for <em>B. idahoensis</em> prior to management activities such as road work and controlled burns (Carey <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Oregon Zoo has provided a source population for reintroductions of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in the Columbia Basin, Washington (Oregon Zoo 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is listed in Utah as a Species of Special Concern, and has been the focus of three ambitious grants designed to assess the effects of current land treatment practices on <em>B. idahoensis</em>, to examine historical trends in habitat loss, and to develop a statewide habitat model to increase management efficiency of the species (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: Current actions include increased survey efforts to document the occurrence of <em>B. idahoensis</em> within its range, and research into its ecology and habitat requirements. Captive breeding has been established for the Columbian Basin DPS and experimental reintroductions have been initiated for the species. Loss and/or modification of habitat include agricultural and urban development, invasive weeds, and changes in fire frequencies (Rachlow 2004). In 2004, 42 captive-bred rabbits were released into the wild at the Idaho National Laboratory for a study intended to evaluate techniques to be used for future Columbia Basin, Washington population reintroductions. Less than half survived more than 18 days, but survival may have been more successful if release pens were more protected from predators and if the rabbits had been released farther apart (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is listed as a species of special concern by Montana Natural Heritage Program (Rauscher 1997).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
45176532,3326,Bunolagus monticularis,Critically Endangered,C2a(i),2019,2016-05-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Riverine Rabbit is endemic to the semi-arid central Karoo region of South Africa (estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 54,227 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) is 2,943 km²). Recent population estimates of 157-207 mature individuals indicate an alarmingly small species population size, with no subpopulation having &gt; 50 mature individuals. The current assessment suggests that the Riverine Rabbit should, under a precautionary purview, remain listed as Critically Endangered C2a(i) due to its inferred small population size and inferred continuing decline from habitat loss and degradation, including ongoing loss of mature individuals. There are an estimated 12 subpopulations (nine in the northern range and three recently discovered south of the historic known range) determined by clusters of &gt;6 sightings within 10 km of each other. Large numbers of surveys throughout the distribution range have confirmed current subpopulations but failed to detect subpopulations in some areas of the historic range (indicated by museum records). Only current subpopulations are used to estimate population size. No subpopulation is estimated to exceed 50 mature individuals (range: 8-46 mature individuals). Subpopulation size was determined by summing independent sightings (non-repeat sightings) from survey data collected between 1999 and 2013. This estimate thus represents minimum sizes and it is possible that subpopulation size is higher, given that this is a cryptic species and difficult to detect. Monitoring work should be continued to improve subpopulation estimates and trends, and this species should be reassessed once further data have been generated. However, we suspect maximum subpopulation size could not be significantly higher, given that previous studies found low densities of the species on the Klipgat farm, Victoria West (0.06–0.17 individuals / ha). Subpopulations are presumably further fragmented and isolated by anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, such as impoundments in river channels and fencing, and are threatened by illegal hunting and predation by domestic animals. Total mature population size (assuming 70% adults) is estimated to be between 157 and 207 individuals.&#160;Additionally, both climate change and fracking are emerging threats to Riverine Rabbits: an initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population. Fracking of the Karoo region is also likely to further reduce suitable habitat and the two threats may synergise. Thus, although population size in this analysis is likely an underestimate as it is based solely on confirmed current sightings, the Critically Endangered listing is retained (over a possible Endangered listing) as emerging threats are likely to severely threaten the already small population. Systematic monitoring and evidence for conservation interventions are desperately needed. Additionally, as the southern subpopulation may be genetically distinct from the northern animals, genetic work and subsequent taxonomic revision may require a possible reassessment of the two putative subspecies.<br/><br/>This species will require reassessment in the near future as recent citizen science records indicate significant increases in known EOO both southwards and eastwards. Conservation agencies are currently establishing camera traps in the areas to confirm the existence of subpopulations in these areas and once these new data are available, the assessment of this species will be updated and possibly revised.","The Riverine Rabbit inhabits dense riparian growth along the seasonal rivers in the central Karoo (Nama-Karoo shrubland). Specifically, it occurs in riverine vegetation on alluvial soils adjacent to seasonal rivers. The habitat is highly fragmented and transformed. Studies show the habitat to be 61% fragmented in certain areas (Duthie 1989). Observations from the more recently discovered southern Cape population include new records spread over thirteen sites (within three subpopulations), of which nine sites are managed as game reserves/nature reserves. The majority of Riverine Rabbit occupancy lies in the Upper Karoo Bioregion (approximately 80%), with about 12% in the Rainshadow Valley Karoo Bioregion, 4% in the Trans-Escarpment Succulent Karoo Bioregion, 3% the in Western Fynbos-Renosterveld Bioregion and 1% in the Lower Karoo Bioregion (Mucina and Rutherford 2006). For the southern population found within the Little Karoo, the presence occurs within the habitat types as described by Vlok and Schutte-Vlok (2010) including Transitional Shrublands Vegetation Type, Arid Renosterveld Habitat Type, Succulent Karoo Vegetation Type, Apronveld Habitat Type and the Randteveld Habitat Type. However, they are not restricted to the alluvial floodplains in the southern Cape (C. Bragg pers. obs. 2014) and can also occur in old lands not associated with riverine vegetation. Further habitat studies are required.<br/><br/>It should be noted that these are broad habitat types whereas subpopulations in the northern part of the distribution are always associated with alluvial floodplains and narrow belts of riverine vegetation adjacent to seasonal rivers on a scale that is unlikely to fit within these broader habitat types. They are thus highly reliant on the critical resource areas of Karoo riparian ecosystems. These descriptions do, however, give an indication of the general vegetation structure and composition within various parts of its range. Home range has been estimated as 12 ha (Duthie 1989). This species is elusive and nocturnal, spending daylight hours in a scrape beneath riparian vegetation. They are solitary, and will only be found in breeding pairs for short periods, or in female-juvenile pairs for rearing purposes (Duthie 1989).<br/><br/>This species is predominantly a browser, but is known to occasionally feed on grasses during the early wet rainy season when short, green grasses become available (Duthie 1989). When browsing, they have been found to show a particular selection for <em>Pteronia erythrochaetha, Kochia pubescens, Salsola glabrescens</em> and species of Aizoacae. They are unable to survive on heavily overgrazed or agriculturally transformed habitats, but have been found feeding on lucerne fields at night.<br/><br/>Ecosystem and cultural services: It is both a flagship species for the Karoo, as well as an indicator species of riparian habitat fringing the rivers of the Nama (Upper and Central Karoo) and the Succulent Karoo where its presence is associated with ecosystem integrity (healthy ecosystem services, such as water infiltration, vegetation cover, and soil health). Its unique habitat is of economic importance to landowners in terms of cultivation and small-stock grazing. Threats to the river ecosystems include overgrazing and anthropogenic land and river &#160;transformation, which leads to the degradation and fragmentation of Riverine Rabbit habitat.","Both populations face significant threats from ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation due to detrimental land-use practices and new emerging habitat-transforming land uses, such as climate change and energy development (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Over the last century, <em>c</em>a 40-60% of the fertile alluvial floodplains and riparian habitat has been lost as a result of cultivation (for example, winter wheat production, mostly in the past) and livestock farming (ongoing) (Duthie 1989; Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994, Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Other threats to the species include hunting (hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers), and accidental mortality in traps set for ‘pest’ animals on farmlands. There is also the potential that the dominance of sheep farming and emerging wildlife ranching for economically valuable species may increase the frequency of both overgrazing (and thus reduction in vital vegetation cover) and predation rates (for example, by higher Black-backed Jackal <em>Canis mesomelas</em> densities). Similarly, habitat degradation through fuel-wood collecting and overgrazing may have led to an increase in predation (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>There are also several emerging threats that could threaten this species. An initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population (Hughes <em>et al</em>. 2008). Hence further study is urgently required as to potential effects of projected climate change over the entire distribution.<br/><br/>Fracking of the Karoo region is also a major emerging threat to Riverine Rabbit habitat due to ancillary activities associated with fracking, which could lead to increased roadkill mortalities, habitat fragmentation and altered hydrology of Karoo river systems, which in turn impacts on the species’ habitat. Similarly, wind farms are also likely to have a significant impact on the species.<br/><br/>Habitat quantity and quality is declining through overgrazing by livestock, resulting in reduced cover from predators and lack of sufficient forage. Reduction in streamflow owing to the construction of dams upstream has presumably also reduced habitat quality (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). High livestock, and in some cases, wildlife, stocking rates have resulted in large areas of the Karoo having reduced vegetation cover and becoming dominated by unpalatable species, which have further reduced vegetation biodiversity and stocking &#160;potential for livestock and game. Additionally, continued rural settlement expansion on the Northern Cape Province, estimated to be 9% from 2000 to 2013 (GeoTerraImage 2015), will presumably increase rates of poaching and predation by dogs. However, stewardship schemes for this species in the Karoo have also been initiated and cover 350,000 ha in the Greater Karoo. Anecdotal evidence suggests improved biodiversity and Riverine Rabbit populations on these farms, as well as greater landowner awareness of the requirements to protect Riverine Rabbits (C. Bragg unpubl. data). Continued biodiversity stewardship expansion will help to mitigate habitat loss and deterioration.","Riverine Rabbits have a critically low population size. For example, Duthie<em> et al</em>. (1989) found low densities of the species on the Klipgat farm, Victoria West (0.06-0.17 individuals / ha). However, this sample represented too few home ranges to extrapolate to population level. Duthie <em>et al</em>. (1989) speculated that remaining habitat might potentially support around 1,435 individuals. However, densities may vary widely among river systems. For example, there is remaining natural habitat on the Ongers River but there is no evidence of Riverine Rabbit occupancy (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Thus the population size may be very much lower (Duthie<em> et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>There are an estimated 12 subpopulations, three in the southern population and nine in the northern population. Subpopulations are isolated from each other by jackal-proof fencing and severe land transformation through agricultural practices. All these subpopulations are estimated to contain less than 50 mature individuals (8–46 mature individuals, based on independent sightings in each river system). There are also an additional five possible historic subpopulations that are represented by five separate museum specimens collected in the past, but no surveys in the past 30 years have confirmed any sightings in those localities, so those five subpopulations are assumed to be locally extinct. To estimate total population size, we used survey data representing confirmed sightings along rivers to indicate size of individual subpopulations along river systems. For population size estimates, the total number of sightings across all 12 subpopulations was 380 individuals, yielding a total population estimate of 207 mature individuals (assuming 70% adults). The alternative estimate, derived from the average density of sightings per 1 km river buffer for all subpopulations multiplied by the total area (AOO), was 224 individuals in total, or 157 mature individuals (Collins and Toit 2016).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is two years (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species has a single litter per year with 1-2 young per litter in a fur- and grass-lined subterranean chamber excavated in stable soils (Duthie 1989). Reproductive periodicity occurs from August through May (Duthie and Robinson 1990). Gestation time is 35-36 days (Duthie 1989). Longevity in captivity is five years (K. Collins unpubl. data).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the central Karoo region of South Africa. It is associated with the dense, discontinuous vegetation fringing the seasonal rivers. It is the only indigenous burrowing rabbit in Africa, and is dependent on soft and deep alluvial soils along the river courses for constructing stable breeding stops. Approximately 40-60% of habitat was lost or fragmented during the 1930s to 1970s due to agricultural expansion on the seasonal river flood plains across its distribution range (Robinson 1981b, Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990). Historically, this species was known to occur in five localities towards the northwestern portion of its range, along the Vis and Renoster Rivers, as well as their tributaries near Calvinia (Duthie 1989). The lack of sightings data during the last 30 years, suggests that <em>Bunolagus monticularis</em> is now locally extinct in these regions (Collins and Toit 2016). This is likely to be a direct consequence of the extensive agricultural expansion along riverine floodplains (Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>A large number of surveys from 1999-2013 throughout the distribution range has improved our estimates of location and sizes of the various subpopulations, and identified a new southern population in 2004, which now consists of three known subpopulations. The southern population is distributed within three catchments: the Breede, Gouritz and Olifant River systems.<br/><br/>Subpopulations are defined as being made up groups of confirmed sightings along first-, second- or third-order rivers that are within a maximum of 10 km of each other. If the groups of sightings are more than 10 km from each other they are not taken as being from the same subpopulation. Due to limited information about dispersal ability of this species and the fact that known densities where home range studies were carried out showed approximately one Riverine Rabbit for every 400 m of river length, 10 km between confirmed sightings was estimated as a reasonable distance to separate subpopulations. A minimum of six sightings was taken to represent a subpopulation (potentially representing up to three breeding pairs). Where less than six sightings occurred in isolation from survey data, these were assumed to be part of the nearest subpopulation based on connectivity along the rivers.<br/><br/>The approximate ranges of both the northern and southern populations was calculated using Kernel Density home range estimation (buffered by 5 km) and combined to give a total extent of occurrence (EOO), estimated as 54,227 km². To calculate area of occupancy (AOO), all rivers inside the EOO were buffered by 1 km on either side. Similarly, all&#160;sightings points were buffered by a 1 km radius and were used to clip the river buffer providing a total estimate of AOO. A buffer of 1 km was chosen as most of the larger patches of riverine vegetation do not occur more than 1 km from rivers, and by buffering all rivers by 1 km, all known sightings were located within these buffered areas. AOO was thus calculated as 2,943 km².&#160;<em></em>","The Riverine Rabbit is suspected to be opportunistically hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers (Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994).",Terrestrial,"<em>&#160;</em>This species occurs mainly outside of formally protected areas. However, it was recently discovered (2013) on the formally protected Anysberg Nature Reserve (C. Birss unpubl. data), and there is a healthy subpopulation based in the private Sanbona Wildlife Reserve (both sites in the Western Cape Province), which is in the process of achieving formal protected status through the CapeNature biodiversity stewardship programme. There is also a substantial proportion of the species’ habitat from the northern population informally protected within the Riverine Rabbit conservancies. The primary conservation interventions involve further protected area expansion, especially through stewardship programmes, and active habitat restoration.<br/><br/>The Drylands Conservation Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT-DCP) was established in August 2003 and coordinates all conservation efforts on the Riverine Rabbit and its habitat. The programme aims to conserve the biodiversity of the Karoo region, to encourage private landowners to participate in conservation stewardship and to promote integrated land management practices that can sustain the Riverine Rabbit, its habitat and many other species while providing employment for communities and facilitating ecosystem restoration on landowners’ farms. The current projects are:&#160;<br/><ul><li>Riparian habitat restoration: Initiated in 2007, the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project develops and implements strategies to regenerate degraded riparian habitat in order to re-connect remaining riverine habitat fragments. Riparian zones perform a variety of functions including storing water, reducing floods, stabilizing river banks, improving water quality by trapping sediment and nutrients, and providing shelter and food for animals. They provide corridors for movement and migration of different species, including Riverine Rabbits, and act as a buffer between aquatic ecosystems and adjacent land uses. Additionally, maintaining the integrity of riparian areas will help mitigate the effects of climate change, which could potentially heavily impact this semi-arid region. To date, the programme has undertaken restoration interventions, including soil and water erosion control, re-vegetating, grazing reduction, and soil health technologies, of 350 ha of <em>Bunolagus </em>habitat, and is monitoring the recovery of the species in these areas, as well as the subsequent improvement of ecosystem services.</li></ul><ul><li>Establishing alternative livelihoods: Labour for the rehabilitation project is sourced locally, thereby creating employment and developing skills in poor rural communities with few other social upliftment opportunities. Through this approach a strong component of the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project lies in the conservation of water resources and regional biodiversity through community involvement. The EWT-DCP established the Indigenous Karoo Plant Nursery in Loxton (Northern Cape) to support the plant needs of the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project. Community members employed by the nursery are trained to propagate indigenous plants needed for the re-vegetation of Riverine Rabbit habitat within riparian zones in the Karoo. Seed is produced on the production plot within the nursery grounds and are supplemented with seeds harvested in the veld by community members. <br/></li></ul><ul><li>Expanding Riverine Rabbit conservancies and stewardship: Little of the Riverine Rabbit’s remaining habitat is protected within nature reserve or national parks; the survival of the Riverine Rabbit is in the hands of private landowners, consisting mostly of farmers. Therefore the EWT‐DCP works in partnership with provincial conservation departments to involve private landowners in biodiversity conservation through the process of ‘stewardship’. Stewardship refers to the wise use, management and protection of that which has been entrusted to the landowner. Within the context of conservation, stewardship means protecting important ecosystems by effectively managing aspects such as invasive alien species, fires, and grazing and cultivation practices. The EWT-DCP works closely with the four Riverine Rabbit conservancies, encompassing an area of approximately 350,000 ha in the Northern and Western Cape provinces. The long‐term goal of the EWT‐DCP is to use these existing conservancies as a stepping stone to upgrade and declare specific and key properties as Protected Areas in terms of South Africa’s National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (No. 57 of 2003). A critical component of the work is to promote and encourage sustainable land-use practices amongst landowners and land managers in the Karoo through developing partnerships with the relevant stakeholders. Thus the EWT-DCP strives to mainstream sustainable land management principles into agricultural practices in the Karoo and into decisions made by policymakers.</li></ul><ul><li>Environmental Education and Awareness: The EWT-DCP creates awareness about Riverine Rabbit conservation efforts with farmers, farm workers and their families, school learners, teachers, and the general public. It aims to establish custodianship by cultivating a sense of ownership for the Riverine Rabbit, its habitat and the river ecosystems of the Karoo.&#160;</li></ul>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:<br/><ul><li>Further surveys are needed to identify Riverine Rabbit habitat and occupancy. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2008) developed a habitat model that showed potential suitable habitat east of Victoria West that might contain isolated subpopulations or offer re-introduction opportunities. The results of such surveys should feed into conservation planning. For example, the work of the Drylands Conservation Programme has succeeded in mitigating impacts of high-risk wind farms through dedicated interventions, particularly in regards to stopping development within suitable habitat. These data would also be used to develop a broad habitat map of the entire distribution range.</li></ul><ul><li>Develop public recognition schemes to encourage private landowners to form conservancies and protect the Riverine Rabbit. Presence on private land should lead to the the exclusion of ranching activities in key habitat areas. This should include developing riparian grazing guidelines to inform sustainable management of riparian areas, and a user-friendly manual of cost-effective sustainable land management technologies to encourage farmers to adopt restoration and sustainable farming practices. Finally, incentives should be identified to encourage landowners to adopt such practices that benefit the species (<em>sensu </em>Pasquini <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li></ul><ul><li>Develop a Riverine Rabbit monitoring tool to facilitate improved conservation outcomes, such as monitoring the impacts of conservation interventions (for example, restoration) on the density of subpopulations and prioritising resources to subpopulations that are declining.</li></ul><ul><li>Development of a legal tool to address Riverine Rabbit conservation: a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004). This includes investigating the genetic and ecological differences between the southern and northern populations and the development of separate conservation strategies for both.</li></ul><ul><li>Although captive breeding was recommended by Collins <em>et al</em>. (2004), captive breeding trials in the 1990s were largely unsuccessful (Dippenaar and Ferguson 1994, Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Thus, the current conservation strategy for the species does not include captive breeding as an option due to the difficulty of breeding this sensitive species in captivity and the higher chance of improving populations in the wild through concerted conservation interventions such as stewardship and habitat restoration.&#160;</li></ul>Encouraged citizen actions:&#160;<br/><ul><li>Landowners can create or join conservancies to protect this species and its habitat.</li></ul><ul><li>Landowners can lower stocking levels to improve riparian ecosystem grazing systems; reduce the number of dogs on farms; and restore riparian habitats through Working for Water and/or the EWT-DCP.</li></ul><ul><li>Landowners and the public can report sightings of individuals on virtual museum platforms (for example, iSpot and MammalMAP) or provincial conservation authorities to enhance the distribution map. For example, new sightings recorded by the public and landowners are recorded in the CapeNature database.&#160;</li></ul>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
45177198,11791,Lepus timidus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-05-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Mountain Hare has a widespread distribution and populations appear to be stable across much of this area (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em>  1999, Angerbjörn 2018). Isolated regions are experiencing population  declines, but these are not significant enough to warrant listing the  species as Near Threatened under the current Red List Criteria. It is  confirmed as Least Concern.","The Mountain Hare inhabits tundra and taiga, particularly pine, birch,  and juniper (Flux and Angermann 1990, Angerbjörn 2018). Moors and  bogland are the preferred habitats for this species in Ireland and  Scotland (Flux and Angermann 1990). However, <em>L. timidus hibernicus</em> will  also utilize cultivated land, rich agricultural area, in Ireland (Thulin  2003). The Mountain Hare occupies lowland woodlands of open steppe in  southern Russia along with reed belts around lakes (Flux and Angermann  1990). In Mongolia, it occurs in forests located on the Altai, Hingan,  Hentei, Hovsgol, and Hangai mountain ranges (Mallon 1985).<br/><br/>The  diet of the Mountain Hare varies in relation to the type of habitat it  occupies (Flux and Angermann 1990, Angerbjörn 2018). Calluna (heather)  constitutes the bulk of the diet in Scotland, while birch, juniper,  poplar, willow, and <em>Vaccinium </em>are selected in Europe (Flux and Angermann  1990). If present, <em>L. timidus</em> will consume palatable grasses and  clovers (Flux and Angermann 1990).<br/><br/>The Mountain Hare is a  nocturnal species that will increase daytime activity during summer  months (Flux and Angermann 1990). Home range for this species ranges  according to locality (Flux and Angermann 1990). In Scotland, home  ranges as small as 10 ha have been observed, while in Finland it was  reported that home ranges could be as large as 305 ha (Flux and  Angermann 1990).<br/><br/>In areas where <em>L. timidus</em> and<em> L. europaeus  </em>coexist,<em> L. timidus</em> will retreat to areas of higher elevation (Thulin  2003). The reason for this is believed to be competitive exclusion,<em> L.  timidus</em> yields habitat to<em> L. europaeus</em> (Thulin 2003).<br/><br/>Litter size  of the Mountain Hare is variable (two to six) according to the number  of litters and the latitude (Angerbjörn 2018). Gestation time is between  47-55 days ( Angerbjörn 2018). The breeding season is February to  August (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). The Mountain Hare reaches maturity  at one year of age. Longevity for <em>L. timidus </em>is nine years (Macdonald  and Barrett 1993). Natural mortality for juveniles is 80%, while adult  mortality is 58% (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). Total length of this  species is 45.7-61.0 cm (Macdonald and Barrett 1993).<br/><br/><em>L. t.  hibernicus </em>is the only endemic hare of Ireland (Reid and Montgomery  2007). Contrary to other mountain hare populations, this subspecies  ""occurs at all altitudes and can be found in most habitats throughout  Ireland"" (Reid and Montgomery 2007). <em>L. t. hibernicus</em> typically forages  on grasses (Reid and Montgomery 2007).","There are several potential threats identified for this species. The  Mountain Hare has successfully hybridized with <em>L. europaeus</em> in areas  where the latter has been introduced (Thulin 2003). The pathogens,  European Brown Hare Syndrome (EHBS) and Tularemia, are considered  problematic, but require research to determine how great an impact they  inflict (Thulin 2003). Competitive exclusion occurring between the  Mountain Hare and the European Hare could be restricting the  distribution of the former (Thulin 2003). The discovery of an introduced  population of <em>L. europaeus</em> to Ireland could pose a threat to <em>L. t.  hibernicus</em> (Reid 2011). More recently abundance has been reduced by a  lack of duration of snow cover caused by global warming (Pedersen <em>et al.</em> 2017).","The Mountain Hare is an abundant species within its range (Flux and  Angermann 1990, Angerbjörn 2018). Populations appear to be stable across  much of its geographic distribution, with fluctuations occurring in  northern Europe and possible declines in the Alps (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em>  1999). Population declines have been observed in Russia and in the  extreme, southern portions of Sweden, the Mountain Hare has disappeared  entirely (Thulin 2003). The Mountain Hare is found at low densities in  tundra areas. In Northern Ireland, historical game bag records indicate  that there has been a substantial decline in hare abundance (Dingerkus  and Montgomery 2002). Populations of the Mountain Hare are subject to  periodic crashes where the cause is potentially parasitism, predation,  climate change, or starvation (Angerbjorn and Flux 1995, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2017, Angerbjörn 2018).",Stable,"The geographic distribution of the Mountain Hare extends from the  Pacific Ocean in the east to the eastern edge of Poland and Scandinavia  (Flux and Angermann 1990, Angerbjörn 2018). The northern most  populations can be found at 75°N in Russia and Scandinavia, extending  south to 40-50°N (Flux and Angermann 1990). Isolated populations are  located in Hokkaido (Japan), Ireland, the Kurile Islands, Sakhalin,  Scotland (Flux and Angermann 1990), and the Alps regions of Austria,  Italy, Germany, France, Slovenia, and Switzerland (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em>  1999). Introduced populations can be found in England, the Faeroes  (Denmark), several Scottish islands (Flux and Angermann 1990). On  Spitsbergen Island, introduced populations failed to persist (Flux and  Angermann 1990).",The Mountain Hare is a popular game species in most countries (Angerbjorn 2018).,Terrestrial,"Regional declines in Mountain Hare populations suggest that research be  conducted to determine the cause(s). Several areas have been suggested:  interspecific competition with <em>L. europaeus</em>, pathogenic impact, and the  effects of hybridization (Thulin 2003). In Ireland, the cause(s) of  population declines require investigation (Dingerkus and Montgomery  2002). The current situation of the endemic Irish Hare (<em>L. t.  hibernicus) </em>needs to be investigated specifically (Reid 2011). In  Mongolia, approximately 12% of the species' distribution occurs in  protected areas (Clark <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006) and has been recorded  in Hustai National Park (Todgerel 2002). In China, it occurs in Honghe,  Xingkaihu, and Sanjiang Nature Reserves.<br/><br/>This species is listed  under the Bern Convention, Appendix III as well as the European Union  Habitats and Species Directive, Annex V (Mitchell-Jones <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999).

45177499,11792,Lepus callotis,Vulnerable,A2bcde,2019,2018-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The White-sided Jackrabbit is widespread in Mexico where there is a  general lack of data regarding current population status. Studies and  reports nonetheless indicate declines for populations in New Mexico,  Durango, and elsewhere in Mexico (Flux and Angermann 1990, Best and  Henry 1993, Traphagen 2011, Brown <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018a,b). The  White-sided Jackrabbit was listed as threatened by the New Mexico  Department of Game and Fish in 1975 and remains at that status (New  Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2006).. Reports by Mexican outfitters  and ranchers, José Fernandez, José Treviño as well as the majority of  literature references (Brown <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018b) indicate major  population reductions or absence within large areas of historic range  where it was previously common. Detailed analyses have occurred in the  US range, largely comparing the surveys of Bednarz (1977) with those of  Traphagen (2011). Based on the total hectares of suitable habitat, it is  estimated that only 9.8% of its former range in the US is currently  occupied by White-sided Jackrabbits. This percentage is less than half  that reported in 1976 (20.1%, Bednarz 1977). The US population has  declined from an estimated 400 total animals to 58 from 1976 to 2010  (Bednarz 1977, Traphagen 2011). The total U.S. and Mexican population  has been estimated to have declined from 12,950 to 2,101.5 over the same  period, a decline of &gt;40% per decade (Myles Traphagen, pers. comm.).  The main stressor on the species appears to be habitat change (Brown <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2018b). Climate change and overgrazing has greatly altered the open  grasslands favored by the White-sided Jackrabbit. These habitat changes  are preferred by the Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. californicus</em>) which has  led to the replacement of the White-sided Jackrabbit in several areas  (Bednarz and Cook 1984, Best and Henry 1993, Desmond 2012). It is  inferred that this will only exacerbate the issue of population decline  based on recent surveys of the species in the US and in Mexico.  Ancillary stressors include predation by feral dogs, illegal hunting,  and vehicle collisions (including by US Border Patrol near the US/Mexico  border). The species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2bcde.","The White-sided Jackrabbit is restricted to Madrean Plains grasslands in New Mexico (Flux and Angermann 1990, Brown <em>et al.</em>  2018a). In the area surrounding the valleys inhabited by this species  north of the Nazas River, grazing has caused an increase of shrubs and a  lower density of grasses, resulting in a replacement of White-sided  Jackrabbits by Black-tailed Jackrabbits (Bednarz and Cook 1984, Desmond  2004). This problem has also been identified in Zacatecas (Mexico) where  the White-sided Jackrabbit also lives in open plains grasslands. South  of the Nazas River, as in Queretaro (Mexico), it is associated with  tropic-subtropic savannas, cultivated areas and pastures (potreros)  (Best and Henry 1993).<br/><br/>Breeding season varies from the middle of  April to August and the average litter size is 2.2 (range 1-4) (Anderson  1972, Bogan and Jones 1975, Bednarz 1977). The White-sided Jackrabbit  is capable of producing up to three litters per year (Bednarz 1977). It  is common to observe this nocturnal species in pairs, particularly  during the breeding season (Flux and Angermann 1990). An average total  length for this species is 55.0 cm (Best and Henry 1993). Unlike the  Black-tailed Jackrabbit, which is a “see and flee” species, the  White-sided Jackrabbit’s escape strategy is to remain motionless or  course through dense grasses undetected. Their diet is thought to be  exclusively grasses, but may consist of roots during dry seasons  (Bednarz 1977). <br/><br/>The White-sided Jackrabbit serves as a game species and a prey source for native carnivores.","Changes in habitat due to grazing negatively impact the White-sided  Jackrabbit by presumably increasing predation rates and resulting in  encroachment by Black-tailed Jackrabbits (Flux and Angermann 1990,  Desmond 2004). In some places, there is competition with Black-tailed  Jackrabbits. Additional threats may include subsistence hunting, human  perturbation and exotic predation. In some places, animal competition  for grasses, habitat fragmentation and land clearings represent  important threats to populations. A model generated for climate  conditions in 2050 indicated a 60% range reduction from the current  potential range for this species (Martinez-Villeda 2006).","In 1976, the density of the White-sided Jackrabbit was estimated at  1/31.6 ha in New Mexico, producing a maximum population of 340 animals  (Bednarz 1977). Between 1976 and 1981, the restricted population in New  Mexico experienced a nearly 50% decline due to habitat change (Flux and  Angermann 1990). This decline was said to be accompanied by an increase  in the presence of Black-tailed Jackrabbits and Desert Cottontails  (<em>Sylvilagus audubonii</em>) (Best and Henry 1993). Historic population  information for Mexico is scarce (Flux and Angermann 1990) but there has  been an observed decline in most populations (Brown <em>et al.</em>  2018b). A survey conducted from 1998-1999 on the Madren Plains grassland  in Chihuahua, Mexico found White-sided Jackrabbit densities of 0.01/ha  and 0.06/ha, respectively (Desmond 2004). Reported density in the US in  2010 was 0.01/ha (Traphagen 2011). It is estimated that only ~ 60  White-sided Jackrabbits currently occur in the US (Traphagen 2011).",Decreasing,"The White-sided Jackrabbit is essentially a Mexican endemic, distributed  from extreme southwestern New Mexico (USA) to northern Oaxaca (Mexico)  (Bailey 1932, Hall 1981, Best and Henry 1993, Villa-Ramirez and  Cervantes 2003, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018a). The White-sided Jackrabbit  has been observed at an elevation of 2,550 m in Puebla and 750 m in  Morelos (Best and Henry 1993). <em>Lepus callotis gaillardi</em> has a discontinuous  distribution that extends from southwestern New Mexico, USA, to  north-central Durango, Mexico (Best and Henry 1993). In Mexico, there  are two isolated subpopulations: one in central Chihuahua and the other  extending from south-central Chihuahua into Durango (Martinez-Villeda  2006). Its distribution in southwestern New Mexico is restricted to two  locations in Hidalgo County at elevations between 1,500-1,600 m (Flux  and Angermann 1990). In 1950, there was a potential sighting of two<em> L.  c. gaillardi</em> on the west side of the Huachuca Mountains in Arizona  (Hoffmeister 1986). The total range in the USA is estimated to be 5,837  ha (Traphagen 2010). The subspecies <em>L. c. callotis </em>is distributed from  the central part of east Durango toward the plains of the central part  of Mexico, along the axis Neovolcanic to northern Guerrero and Oaxaca  (Best and Henry 1993, Villa-Ramirez and Cervantes 2003).","The White-sided Jackrabbit is hunted for subsistence and sport in  Mexico. Nonetheless, no systematic surveys or harvest estimates are  conducted.",Terrestrial,"Research should be concentrated on determining population status,  numbers and range, as well as efforts to establish trends and monitoring  in populations both north and south of Nazas River. Population decline  in New Mexico prompted the listing of White-sided Jackrabbits as  “Threatened” in 1975 by New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (New  Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2006). Efforts have been made to  periodically monitor population status and trends in New Mexico, as well  as, encouraging shrub control and non-detrimental grazing practices by  landowners (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2006). Range  reduction, indicated by climate change models, is expected to be most  severe in the northern portion of this species' range. It is suggested  that assessments be made of the population density of <em>L. c. gaillardi </em> and habitat transformation, to determine the impact future changes will  have on its survival (Martinez-Villeda 2006).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

From southern Sinaloa to western Michoacán, they occur  along the coastal plain at sea level to the mountain slopes (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990). In central Mexico they occur in pine and pine-oak  forest, particularly with clumped understory grasses, xeric scrub  dominated by Kidneywood Tree (<em>Eysenhardtia polystachya</em>), Shadbush  (<em>Amelanchier </em>spp.) and Sumac (<em>Rhus </em>spp.), grasslands of Mexican  Broomroot (<em>Muhlenbergia</em> <em>macroura</em>) and Peruvian Feather Grass (<em>Stipa  ichu</em>), Alligator Juniper forests (<em>Juniperus deppeana</em>), and oak forests  (<em>Quercus </em>spp.) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018).

Up to six young are produced per litter and gestation time is 28-34 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018). Total length for this species ranges from 48.5-51.5 cm (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The  Mexican Cottontail is sympatric with other Lagomorphs in portions of  its range, including the Volcano Rabbit (<em>Romerolagus diazi</em>), Desert  Cottontail (<em>Sylvilagus audubonii</em>), the Eastern Cottontail (<em>S.  floridanus</em>), White-sided Jackrabbit (<em>Lepus callotis</em>), the Black-tailed  Jackrabbit (<em>L. californicus</em>), and the Antelope Jackrabbit (<em>L. alleni</em>)  (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005). Mexican Cottontails are preyed upon by  Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), Grey Foxes (<em>Urocyon  cinereoargenteus</em>), Pumas (<em>Puma concolor</em>), Owls (<em>Tyto </em>spp.), Hawks (<em>Buteo  </em>spp.), snakes and American Crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em>) (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1992, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Mexican  Cottontails are an important food source for native predators  throughout their range. They are also primary consumers and seed  dispersers, especially for Alligator Juniper (Lezama-Delgado <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Although  they engage in group feeding and running in pairs, this species can  also be strongly aggressive and can be contained in a maximum group size  of 3-4 females and 2 males within a 530 m2 habitat (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The Mexican Cottontail is threatened in some areas by overgrazing,  hunting, habitat fragmentation, and habitat destruction, which has  caused the decline of some populations (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). It  is also vulnerable to human-induced fires and volcanic activity. Habitat  reduction has been estimated to be between 13-23% over the last three  generations (Cuarón and de Grammont pers. comm.). A climate change model  generated for 2050, indicated that there will be 22% range reduction  (primarily along the Pacific coast, impacting <em>S. c. pacificus</em>) from the  current potential range of this species (Martinez-Villeda 2006).","The Mexican Cottontail was previously considered to be abundant (Chapman  and Ceballos 1990), but has experienced recent declines in portions of  its range (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has been reported that the  average density was 27 ± 5.4 individuals/km² in central Mexico at La  Malinche National Park, Tlaxcala, which varies according to the rainy  and dry seasons (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recent declines have been  associated with areas where overgrazing, hunting, and habitat  degradation occur (Gilcrease 2014).",Decreasing,"The Mexican Cottontail is endemic to Mexico and has the widest  distribution of all endemic cottontails in Mexico. Its range extends  from mid-Sinaloa, continuing south along the Pacific coast to Oaxaca,  including the Axis Neovolcanic and western region of Veracruz (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em>  2018). Its altitudinal distribution ranges from sea level to  approximately 4,300 m (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). Presently there are  three subspecies: <em>S. c. cunicularius</em> which occurs in the central portion  if the distribution (Axis Neovolcanic into the states of Michoacán,  Guerrero, and Oaxaca), <em>S. c. insolitus</em> occurring in the northern extent  of the species’ distribution from mid-Sinaloa along the Pacific coastal  plain to the south-central region of Jalisco, and <em>S. c. pacificus</em> which  occurs from the southern region of Jalisco south along to the Pacific  coastal plain to Oaxaca (Hall 1981).",Mexican Cottontails are hunted for subsistence and sport and as a potential competitor with livestock (Lorenzo <em>et al</em>. 2018).,Terrestrial,"Although once abundant throughout its range, this species experiences  pressure from habitat destruction, overgrazing, and hunting which have  contributed to recent declines in portions of the range (Gilcrease 2014,  Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018).

45181534,21212,Sylvilagus transitionalis,Vulnerable,A2ce,2019,2018-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species once had a widespread distribution across New England, USA.  Suitable habitat for the New England Cottontail has declined by an  estimated 86% since 1960, and the available habitat has become  increasingly fragmented (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fenderson <em>et al.</em>  2014). It is confirmed as Vulnerable because a population size reduction has occurred  since 1994 and in the last ten years it is suspected to be greater than  30%. The decline is continuing due to further habitat  destruction/modification and fragmentation resulting from urbanization  and suburbanization, and competition with the expansion of the range of  the New England Cottontail. Currently New England Cottontails occupy  less than 15% of their historic range, and they are considered  Endangered and are protected (no hunting) in Maine and New Hampshire.  They are considered a game animal in the remainder of their range. There  is a substantial effort underway to increase abundance of habitat in a  large portion of the historic range of NEC. However, much of this effort  will require years for managed lands to develop into suitable habitat,  and a substantial portion will never be suitable given site  characteristics. Likewise, introductions of captive-bred rabbits have  had some modest successes and also failures. These have not offset  continued losses. As a result, most populations continue to decline in  the occupied range. The USFWS (2015) denied a petition to list the New  England Cottontail as an endangered or threatened species and to  designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  This decision is controversial based on available data of population  estimates, the misrepresentation of the historical range of the species,  and failure to acknowledge that ongoing attempts to conserve the  species have been over-stated.","The New England Cottontail occupies areas of open woods and shrubs  (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), often with sandy soils. This species is a  habitat specialist. It historically occupied early successional forests  that became abundant when farmlands were abandoned, and the maturation  of these forests into closed-canopy stands caused decline of this  species beginning in the 1960s (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is  typically found close to streams, swamps, ponds, or lakes in dense cover  with a shrub dominated understory (generally &gt;20,000 stems/ha), and  will rarely venture more than 5 m from escape cover (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2018). Radio-tracking suggests New England Cottontails are using the  invasive Japanese Barberry (<em>Berberis thunbergii</em>) as an important cover  type, particularly when Eastern Cottontail populations are present  (Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>Minimum patch sizes of 2.5 ha have been  suggested for New England Cottontail populations, based on foraging  efficiency in winter settings (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993). However,  because summer home range size is greater, this may be too conservative  of a target (Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>The diet of New England Cottontails  includes a variety of herbaceous plants, fruits, and seeds, and in the  winter it consumes woody species (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).<br/><br/>Outside  of the breeding season New England Cottontails are often solitary. They  have an average litter size of 4.2 young/litter, the average female  produces 2.5 litters during the mid-March through August breeding season  (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2018). Adults range in size from 38.6–43.0 cm (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The New England Cottontail is most threatened by habitat destruction (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). Urban-suburban sprawl and industrial development expand into and  fragment the habitat of this species. These areas are better suited to  the Eastern Cottontail (<em>S. floridanus</em>). Recent genetic studies suggest  this population isolation is leading to moderate-to-strong genetic drift  in many portions of the range (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>New  England Cottontails have historically declined due to maturation of  second-growth forests and fragmentation of suitable habitat (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). The conversion of native shrublands to other land uses,  confusion with Eastern Cottontails by sportsmen, and lack of education  on existence, biology, and habitat requirements of this species cause  problems for the conservation of this species.<br/><br/>Competition with Eastern Cottontails may also place pressure on New England Cottontail populations (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). Decline in the New England Cottontail coincides with growth in  Eastern Cottontail populations. Captive trials suggest that the species  may not be exerting much competition (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008),  however, telemetry estimates indicate that habitat usage for the New  England Cottontail shifts where the two species overlap in distribution  (Cheeseman 2017).","The New England Cottontail is rare to scarce in many portions of its  range. Recent census efforts suggest that around 17,000 New England Cottontails exist in the wild, with the majority of these found in  Connecticut and Massachusetts (10,000 and 4,600 individuals,  respectively, USFWS 2015). Population estimates are smaller in New York  (1,600 individuals) and Maine (700 individuals), and are extremely  limited in New Hampshire (&lt;180 individuals) and Rhode Island (&lt;100  individuals) (USFWS 2015). However, these estimates may be overstated,  as they assume rabbits occupy all known available habitat within focal  areas, which is contravened by most field studies. Many rabbits in  Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, southeast New York, and  western Connecticut are found on small habitat patches (&lt;3 ha), which  probably only support 3-4 individuals per patch (Barbour and Litvaitis  1993, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008). As patches of less than 2.5 ha are  likely population sinks (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993) many of these  patches are unlikely to contribute to New England Cottontail population  recruitment.<br/><br/>Recent survey efforts have also suggested population  decline since the early 2000s in the Merrimack River Valley of New  Hampshire, northward from Manchester to Concord, and in northern Rhode  Island (USFWS 2015). Historical estimates suggest that the New England  cottontail peaked in abundance and distribution in the 1960s (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008), benefiting from succession that occurred on land cleared in the mid-19<sup>th </sup>and early 20<sup>th </sup>centuries (Foster <em>et al.</em>  2002). Across much of their range, including areas of eastern New York,  genetic evidence suggests highly restricted gene flow, strong  population fragmentation and genetic drift (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cheeseman 2017).",Decreasing,"New England Cottontails historically occurred throughout  southern Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, eastern New York,  Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Whitaker and Hamilton (1998) include a  small region of southern Quebec. A study by Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  (2008) estimated that the current area of occupancy (AOO) in its historic  range is 12,180 km², approximately 86% less than the occupied range in  1960. This study showed small patches of populations existing in coastal  southeastern Maine, coastal and Merrimack River valley region of  southern New Hampshire, southeastern New York, western and some of  eastern Connecticut (east of Connecticut River), western Massachusetts,  parts of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Estimates suggest  ongoing range contraction, with 2% of the range of New England  Cottontails lost per year (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, USFWS 2015).","Overall, numbers of cottontails harvested have not declined, but  the percent of New England Cottontails in the harvest has. The species  is hunted for sport, for food, and for ornamental/decorative goods.  Cottontail hunting has been prohibited in Maine since 2004 and New  Hampshire prohibits take of any cottontails in areas where the New  England Cottontail occurs (USFWS 2015).",Terrestrial,"The New England Cottontail was recommended by Chapman and  Stauffer in 1979 to be listed by the IUCN as a species of special  concern due to the significant differences between it and the Eastern  Cottontail, which is now sympatric in much of its range (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990). In 2004 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  began consideration of this species to be listed as a threatened or  endangered species (Litvaitis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Protection  under the Endangered Species Act was declined based on known scattered  occurrences across its range as well as presence within protected areas  (Department of the Interior - Fish and Wildlife Service 2004). In 2006, a  subsequent review found sufficient evidence to designate the species as  a candidate and begin a warranted-but-precluded 12 month findings on  the New England Cottontail (Department of the Interior - Fish and  Wildlife Service 2006). In 2015 a decision not to list the New England  Cottontail was made based on the assumption that populations had been  artificially high due to age of succession in New England habitats and  were subsequently declining as habitats aged (USFWS 2015). <br/><br/>Very  little good habitat for the New England Cottontail is protected, and  tracts of scrub oak barrens should be purchased and protected.  Conservation of critical habitat and establishment and management of  “Important Mammal Areas” containing known populations, with appropriate  publicity and public education programs have been implemented.<br/><br/>The  New England Cottontail is in need of more research, including surveying  and population monitoring, research on nest sites, dispersal, habitat,  use of corridors, response to climatic change and stochastic events,  effects of sport hunting, competition with other lagomorphs, and  response to invasive vegetative species (especially how invasive plants  affect spread of parasites and disease).<br/><br/>Captive breeding and  reintroductions have been ongoing through work at the Roger Williams  Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island.

The status of distinct subspecies along the Pacific coast is unclear.","<p>The Snowshoe Hare<em> </em>is associated with boreal and mixed deciduous forest of North America. It requires mixed forest with dense understory, which it uses as cover. Summer pelage is always brown; winter pelage color depends on snow duration and ephemerality and is white in most of the range, with winter brown morphs found in &lt;10% of the range almost all within a narrow strip along the maritime western Pacific coast of North America (Mills <em>et al.</em> 2018, Nagorsen 1983). Typically, stands aged 25-40 years are ideal. The Snowshoe Hare also seems to favor edge habitat. Diet consists mostly of grasses, forbs, sedges, and ferns (Murray 2003, Krebs and Murray 2018).<br/> <br/> The total length of Snowshoe Hares is 36.0 - 52.0 cm (Banfield 1974, Hall 1981). Their breeding season extends from March to September and is subject to photoperiod and hormonal control (Murray 2003, Zimova <em>et al.</em> 2018).

Populations in the boreal forest fluctuate according to a 10-year cycle, where their densities may vary 100-fold over the span of several years. Southern populations may be noncyclic or fluctuate with reduced amplitude (Krebs and Murray 2018, Krebs <em>et al.</em> Boutin 2018).

This may be related to habitat loss and increases in generalized predator (especially Coyote <em>Canis latrans</em>) numbers. Climate change is also likely to affect hare distribution and abundance, as decreasing snow duration increases camouflage mismatch of winter white hares on brown snowless backgrounds which in turn increases predation-induced mortality (Mills <em>et al</em>. 2013, Zimova <em>et al. </em>2016).",Stable,"The Snowshoe Hare appears in boreal and mixed deciduous forests of North America.

45186309,41276,Lepus californicus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is a widespread species. As such it does not  qualify for threatened status under current criteria and it is confirmed Least Concern. However, a recent  survey of long-term harvest information based on data from all western  United States state game and fish agencies indicated a consistent  downward trend in the numbers of most western United States (primarily  Black-tailed and White-tailed Jackrabbits)—these species are not  separated in agency databases, but the Black-tailed Jackrabbit is a  major component of these databases (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). This  downward trend is thought to be attributable to long term drought,  habitat changes and the cessation of predator control activities.  Numbers of this species are not prone to cycles as has been previously  reported (Simes <em>et al.</em> 2015).","The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is capable of inhabiting many types of habitat (Flinders and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em>  2018). This species is positively associated, in terms of abundance and  distribution, with grazing by domestic livestock (Flinders and Chapman  2003s, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). Diet is also variable for this  species, dependent upon vegetation availability and location (Flinders  and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018). Generally, grasses and  forbs are selected during the summer, while shrubs are chosen during  winter months (Flinders and Chapman 2003). Variability in home range  size is due to multiple factors like cover, predators, and competition  (Flinders and Chapman 2003). Black-tailed Jackrabbits exhibit a  crepuscular feeding behavior (Flinders and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em>  2018). The breeding season is variable, contingent on latitude and  environmental factors (Flinders and Chapman 2003). In Idaho the season  is restricted to February to May (French <em>et al.</em> 1965). Where  distribution occurs at lower latitudes the breeding season extends, in  the southwestern USA it may last from early January to September  (Griffing and Davis 1976).  <br/><br/>The Magdalena Island Black-tailed  Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. magdalenae</em>) is restricted to Margarita and Magdalena  islands where its habitat consists of xeric scrubland, halophyte  vegetation, mainly in the coastal dune areas and some smaller areas  covered by mangroves. The predominant plant species recorded in the  habitat of this subspecies are the Desert Limberbush (<em>Jatropha cuneata</em>),  Adam’s Tree (<em>Fouquieria diguetii</em>), Yellow Daisy (<em>Euphorbia margaritae</em>),  Goatnut (<em>Simmondsia chinensis</em>), Red Sand Verbina (<em>Abronia maritima</em>),  Pincushion (<em>Cochemiea halei</em>), Strawberry Hedgehog (<em>Echinocereus  brandegeei</em>), Ragweed (<em>Ambrosia magdalenae</em>), California Threeawn  (<em>Aristida californica</em>), Sweet Mangrove (<em>Maytenus phillanthoides</em>), and  Satin Milkvetch (<em>Astragalus magdalenae var. magdalenae</em>) as well as some  herbaceous plants in the families Poaceae and Asteraceae (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em>  2014, 2018). <em>Lepus c. magdalenae</em> shares its habitat with several  endemic rodents such as <em>Chaetodipus arenarius albulus</em>, <em>C. spinatus  magdalenae</em>, <em>Peromyscus eva</em>, <em>Peromyscus maniculatus magdalenae</em>,<em> Neotoma  bryanti bryanti</em> and <em>Thomomys nigricans anitae</em> and some birds such as the  Northern Crested Caracara (<em>Caracara cheriway</em>) and reptiles such as the  rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus</em> spp., Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018).<br/><br/>The predominant vegetation of the Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. sheldoni</em>) habitat is xeric scrubland, with some areas covered by halophyte vegetation in coastal sand dunes and mangrove, interspersed with semi-open areas, plains, and rocky soil. Within the predominant plant species in the habitat are Velvet Mesquite (Prosopis articulata), Adam’s Tree (<em>Fouquieria diguetii</em>), Elephant Tree (<em>Bursera microphylla</em>), Ironwood (<em>Olneya tesota</em>), <em>Euphorbia magdalenae</em>, Glasswort (<em>Arthrocnemum subterminale</em>) and Desert Limberbush (<em>Jatropha cuneata</em>) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018).<br/>The  Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. c. sheldoni) shares its range  with other terrestrial mammals as Bryant's Woodrat (Neotoma bryanti  bryanti), Eva's Desert Mouse (<em>Peromyscus eva carmeni</em>), and the Spiny  Pocket Mouse (<em>Chaetodipus spinatus occultus</em>), as well as the endemic  Monserrat Chuckwalla (<em>Sauromalus slevini</em>), Cnemidophorus carmensis, and  Western Blind Snake (<em>Leptotyphlops humilis lindsayi</em>) and the Baja  California Rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus enyo enyo</em>) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018).","Black-tailed Jackrabbits are not at risk from hunting for sport and  local subsistence, but the effects of human perturbation and exotic  predation are unknown. In some places competition with livestock,  habitat fragmentation and human-induced fire represent important threats  to populations. Declining habitat quality and climate change may also  be affecting populations. Decreasing control of Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>),  Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), and other predators has led to an increase in  predation on this species.<br/><br/>The Magdalena Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. magdalenae</em>) shares its habitat with predators such as Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans peninsulae</em>) with an average population density estimated of 0.73 individuals/km² and a number estimated of 230 individuals on the island, which may be negatively affecting the endemic populations of this subspecies. On the Margarita Island, Goats (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>) and several Feral Cats and their traces (footprints and excreta, <em>Felis sylvestris</em>) were obsered in the habitat of <em>L. c. magdalenae</em>, as well as also nests of Osprey (<em>Pandion haliaetus</em>). The high density of Feral Cats represents competing exotic fauna that can affect the endemic populations of the jackrabbits on the island (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2014, 2018).<br/>The  Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. sheldoni</em>) also shares its  range with a high density of Feral Cats, which may be affecting the  population of the island's endemic subspecies (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014,  2018).","Population density can vary widely from 0.1-1.2 animals/ha in natural  habitats, to 1.5-208/ha on adjacent agricultural land (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018). In 2009 and 2010 the population density of <em>L. c.  magdalenae</em> on Magdalena Island was estimated to be 15.3 individuals/km²  and the total number of individuals was estimated at 4,804 in an area of  314 km². For the same subspecies on Margarita Island, the population  density estimated in 2010 was 1.05 individuals/km² and the number of  individuals was estimated to be 250 in an area of 238.5 km². In 2009 and  2011 the population density of <em>L. c. sheldoni</em> was estimated to be 9.8  individuals/km² with and estimated population of 926 in an area of 94.6  km² (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018). Populations have also been noted  to vary significantly over time. For example, the reported harvest of  jackrabbits in California in 1964 was over 3,000,000 – a value that has  declined to less than 100,000/year since 1997 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). These trend data are mirrored in several western states in the USA (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is widely distributed across Mexico and the USA (Flinders and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018).

45187424,41280,Lepus europaeus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The European Hare is confirmed Least Concern; it is widespread and abundant across its  geographic range (Flux and Angermann 1990, Schai-Braun and Hackländer  2016, Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018). There is evidence of population  declines beginning in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century in association with the  intensification of agricultural practices (Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2018). It is listed under Appendix III of the Bern Convention in Europe  (as “<em>Lepus capensis</em> (<em>europaeus</em>)” Council of Europe 1979). Several  European countries have placed the European Hare on their Red List as  ""Near Threatened"" or ""Threatened"" (Reichlin <em>et al.</em> 2006). There is increasing concern regarding the status of regional  forms of this species (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). However, the  status in Europe and the European Union is “Least Concern” (Temple and  Terry 2007).","The European Hare is a highly adaptable species that can persist in  numerous habitat types from sea level to alpine areas (Hackländer and  Schai-Braun 2018). There is a positive association with hare abundance  and habitat diversity (Smith, Jennings and Harris 2005). Various surveys  have investigated habitat preferences of European Hares. As the study  areas vary considerably, the results diverge also substantially.  However, fallow land is preferred consistently in all studies, whereas  residential areas are avoided (Schai-Braun <em>et al.</em> 2013,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). When available, weeds and wild grasses  are selected by the European Hare, however, intensified agro-practices  have reduced this food source resulting in the selection of crop species  (Reichlin, Klansek and Hackländer 2006, Schai-Braun <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The  European Hare averages three litters/yr, but can vary from one to five  litters/yr (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). Litter size can vary with  respect to the season, smaller litters produced earlier in the season  and larger litters later (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2018). The birth  weight of the European Hare is approximately 100 g (Hackländer and  Schai-Braun 2018). Gestation is 42 days and reproduction occurs year  round in suitable habitats. In northern ranges or higher altitude  reproduction is restricted to summer (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).  Physiological age is 8-12 years (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).  Females reach maturity around 4-5 months Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2018).","A study reviewing available literature regarding population  densities in connection with habitat that was identified as primarily  farmland from 12 European countries, concluded that the primary cause of  the European Hare decline was intensification of agriculture (Smith <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2005). It is inferred that this threat is pertinent to the species  across its geographic range where farming is practiced. Smith <em>et al.</em>  (2005) also identified negative associations with predation and  precipitation in respect to abundance. However, ""field size,  temperature, precipitation, and hunting had no effect on density  throughout Europe"" (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Greece, Spain, France  and Denmark, the restocking of hares from other regions or countries to  complement hare densities for hunting has been identified as a threat to  regional gene pools (Mamuris <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). This issue has also been identified as  a concern for the Cantabric population in Spain (Palacios <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>  2004). Disease is an additional threat to the European Hare and several  have been identified as the principle sources of mortality (Lamarque,  Barrat and Moutou 1996). These diseases are European Brown Hare Syndrome  (EBHS), Pasteurellosis, Yersiniosis (Pseudo-tuberculosis), Coccidiosis  and Tularaemia (Lamarque <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lavazza and Cooke 2018).<br/><br/>Genetic  diversity of the European Hare in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of  Germany indicates that hare populations still retain sufficient  diversity (Fickel <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005).  However, it is cautioned that restricted gene flow could eventually lead  to allelic fixation and inbreeding depression within populations that  become isolated (Fickel <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005).","Populations of the European Hare have been experiencing declines in many  areas across its geographic range in Europe (Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2018). Natural population densities are about 2/100 ha, but can reach  up to 275/100 ha in highly suitable habitats (Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2016).<br/><br/>A study conducted in the Czech Republic found mean hare  densities were highest in habitat with the following characteristics  (Pikula <em>et al.</em> 2004): elevation (sea level up to 200 m); annual  snow cover duration (40-60 days); mean annual precipitation (450-700  mm); annual sunshine duration (1801-2000 hrs); mean annual air  temperature (&gt;10˚C).<br/><br/>Population dynamics are mainly affected  by juvenile mortality due to annual differences in weather conditions,  mechanical activities in agricultural land, diseases, and predation  (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).",Decreasing,"The current Eurasian distribution of the European Hare extends from the  northern provinces of Spain, to introduced populations in the United  Kingdom and southern regions of Scandinavia, south to northern portions  of the Middle East, and has naturally expanded east to sections of  Siberia. The south-eastern boundary of its range runs from the southern  Caspian Sea south to the Persian Gulf (Flux and Angermann 1990,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016, Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018). This  species has been introduced as a game species extensively to countries  across the globe, including eastern Australia, New Zealand, South  America up to 28°S, Canada, and the United States (Great Lakes Area), as  well as numerous islands in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean (Hackländer  and Schai-Braun 2018). This species can be found at elevations ranging  from sea level up to 2,400 m (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016).","The European Hare is recognized as an important game species  throughout its historical distribution, including those areas where it  has been introduced (Flux and Angermann 1990, Schai-Braun and Hackländer  2016, Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).",Terrestrial,"The European Hare is recognized as an important game species  throughout its distribution and as such conservation measures are  required to halt declining populations (Flux and Angermann 1990). The  recent decline of this species has garnered it protection under the Bern  Convention as an Appendix III listing (Council of Europe 1979). In  Norway, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, population declines have  resulted in country-specific Red Listing as ""near threatened"" or  ""threatened"" (Reichlin <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Research is needed to  determine population dynamics specific to habitat type and the effects  habitat change has on life history parameters with regard to declines  (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). There is a lack of understanding as to why  hare numbers are low in pastoral landscapes and therefore, research  should be conducted within this habitat type with particular emphasis  paid to demography and behavioral ecology (Smith <em>et al.</em>  2005).When population declines are the direct result of agricultural  intensification, which results in increased application of fertilizer,  landscape homogeneity and mechanization, population declines of the  European Hare can be countered by augmenting habitat to boost  heterogeneity (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>In Spain, molecular  phylogenetic studies have shown that the Cantabric population has unique  mtDNA in relation to other European populations (Palacios <em>et al.</em>  2004). As an important hunting species, declining numbers have prompted  the importation of non-Iberian hares (from France and elsewhere) to  supplement hare densities (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004). In an effort to conserve this population's gene pool, a captive breeding program has been implemented (Palacios <em>et al.</em>  2004). As of 2003 this program has successfully bred leverets and in  2004 turned its focus to increasing genetic variability by introducing  individuals from new localities (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Population status  across its entire distribution is not currently known, but non-trivial  declines have been observed over the past 150 years across much of its  range (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). This cold-tolerant jackrabbit is now  rare or extinct in portions of its former range in British Columbia,  Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Missouri, and Washington (Applegate 1997, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). It  is a species of concern in California (Williams 1986), and was reported  to be absent from former habitats in the Yellowstone ecosystem (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, Berger 2008) - a status shown to be overly pessimistic by Gunther <em>et al.</em>  (2009). The cause of this reduction is generally thought to center on  the conversion of native prairie to shrub-steppe or agriculture and/or  the arrival of expanding Black-tailed Jackrabbit populations better  suited to human disturbance (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is unknown  whether these declines and replacement by Black-tailed Jackrabbits have  been the result of habitat changes or reflect a continuation of climatic  shifts that have occurred throughout Holocene times (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). Therefore this species is declining and is clearly a species that should be carefully watched.","The primary habitat of the White-tailed Jackrabbit is open prairie and  plains grassland, but this varies with locality (Flux and Angermann  1990, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018). They are also found on montane and  subalpine pastures among scattered evergreens to 3,100 m altitude in  Colorado (Flux and Angermann 1990). Diet of this species is  predominantly grasses and forbs, with shrubs during the winter (Lim  1987). The breeding season was recorded to extend from late February  through mid-July in North Dakota (Flux and Angermann 1990). A similar  breeding season was recorded in Wyoming (Rogowitz 1992). The season is  shortened in the northern extent of its range to May through early July  (Lim 1987). The gestation period is variable, one account sets it as low  as one month and another as high as 43 days (Lim 1987). It is thought  that elevation and latitude may influence total gestation time (Lim  1987). Breeding conditions and environmental factors influence the total  number of litters produced each year (Lim 1987). Common litter size is  recorded as four to five young. Longevity is unknown but speculated to  be up to five years (Forsyth 1999).","There are numerous hypothesized factors contributing to the decline of  the White-tailed Jackrabbit, but the most prevalent appears to be the  conversion of native prairie to shrub-steppe or non-grass agriculture.  This habitat alteration has led to the exclusion of White-tailed  Jackrabbits where the distribution expansion of Black-tailed Jackrabbits  has occurred (Lim 1987, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The population density of White-tailed Jackrabbits varies greatly  temporally and across the range of the species. In the shortgrass  prairie region it has been reported at a density of 2.2 per square km,  but densities as high as 43 – 71/km² have been recorded in Minnesota and  Iowa, respectively (Beever <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The White-tailed Jackrabbit has a wide geographic distribution. Its  historic distribution extended across the southern regions of Canada,  including south-central British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan,  southwestern Manitoba and the extreme southwest of Ontario (Flux and  Angermann 1990, Beever <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).

This  distribution represented an expansion from its original distribution,  which resulted from the creation of suitable habitat (Lim 1987). There  is some debate to whether this species was introduced to Wisconsin (Lim  1987). Now, however, the range of the species is definitely contracting.  Some treatments indicate that this species has been possibly extirpated  from British Columbia, southern Nebraska, Kansas and Illinois, and some  recent distribution maps exclude Missouri (Flinders and Chapman 2003).  The White-tailed Jackrabbit is excluded from some areas of its range  resulting from the expansion of the Black-tailed Jackrabbit (Lim 1987).  This species was recorded at an elevation of 4,319 m on Mt. Bross,  Colorado (Lim 1987).

It occurs in many protected areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). The species is confirmed Least Concern.<br/><br/>Swamp  Rabbits are considered endangered in the state of Indiana and a species  of special concern in Missouri and South Carolina (Indiana Department  of Natural Resources 2017, Missouri Department of Conservation 2018,  Nielsen and Berkman 2018).","Swamp Rabbits occur in swampy, lowland, or river bottom areas, always  near water (Chapman and Feldhamer 1981). They are always associated with  water and will swim to escape predators and hunters (Whitaker and  Hamilton 1998). In Illinois, bottomland hardwood forest habitat is  preferred, as are areas of brushy habitat and canopy cover (Zollner,  Smith and Brennan 2000a, Scharine <em>et al.</em> 2009, Scharine <em>et al.</em> 2011, Berkman <em>et al.</em>  2018). Use of early successional bottomland habitats suggests that  restoration efforts could help maintain populations (Crawford <em>et al.</em>  2018). Because of their habitat preferences, Swamp Rabbits have been  suggested as an indicator of quality bottomland forest habitat (Hillard <em>et al.</em>  2017). Despite their preference for lowlands, adjacent upland areas may  provide important habitat during seasonal flooding (Vale and Kissell  2010). Radiotracking studies suggest that Swamp Rabbits avoid open  areas, such as residential areas, agricultural areas, and roads  (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2018). Swamp Rabbit occupancy and detectability increase in larger tracts of habitat (Fantz <em>et al.</em> 2017). In timber habitat Swamp Rabbit density is around 2 rabbits/ha (Nielsen and Berkman 2018).<br/><br/>Swamp Rabbits prefer a diet of sedges and also feed on grasses and forbs (Chapman and Ceballos 1990).<br/><br/>Females  have litter sizes from one to six, and produce two to five litters per  year (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). Gestation is 35-40 days (Whitaker and  Hamilton 1998) and females reach sexual maturity at 152 days of age.","Swamp Rabbits are a favorite game species, though their speed, ability  to swim, and habitat preferences offers some protection from hunters and  predators (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Hunting is regulated by  individual state wildlife agencies (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). While  hunting is not a major threat to stable populations (Nielsen and Berkman  2018), Swamp Rabbits appear to have a sensitivity to harvest in the  late season (winter) (Bond <em>et al.</em> 2004). Population viability  modeling suggests that changes in fecundity and catastrophic flooding  may pose the greatest risk to the species (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Habitat  loss has been the greatest cause of decline of Swamp Rabbits. In  Missouri in 1973, a decline of suitable habitat from 850,000 ha to  40,000 ha was recorded over the previous 103 years (Korte and  Fredrickson 1977). The habitat was converted from forest to cropland.  Changes to waterways and resulting flooding also negatively impact the  availability of habitat for Swamp Rabbits (Nielsen and Berkman 2018).<br/><br/>Habitat  fragmentation is an issue associated with human encroachment upon Swamp  Rabbit habitat. Many Swamp Rabbit populations exist on small tracts of  private property, impeding dispersal and creating difficulties for  management (Scheibe and Henson 2003).<br/><br/>Flooding of wet forested  areas has a negative impact on Swamp Rabbit populations, but floods in  some areas induce dispersal (Scheibe and Henson 2003).","Swamp Rabbits are an important game species in much of their range and  are hunted for meat, fur, and sport. They are known to be locally  abundant in some areas but appear to be declining in others (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990, Barbour <em>et al.</em> 2001, Scheibe and Henson 2003). Few studies have been conducted to determine the abundance or decline of Swamp Rabbits.<br/><br/>In  Missouri, the overall area of suitable habitat is decreasing, but there  are still several viable populations within the known range, and there  is some indication that new populations have recently been naturally  established, possibly due to dispersal facilitated by flooding (Scheibe  and Henson 2003). In Louisiana, there are large tracts of suitable  habitat and it is an important game species (Chapman and Ceballos 1990).<br/><br/>In  South Carolina, the Rabbit Hunter Survey data from 2016-2017 show that  there is an increase in rabbits jumped/hour, 1.35 (2007-2008) to 1.58  (2016-2017), but of the rabbits harvested only 1.72% were Swamp Rabbits  (South Carolina Rabbit Hunter Survey, 2016-2017).<br/><br/>Three  population viability analyses (PVA) have provided insight into local  population trends of Swamp Rabbits at the northern fringe of their  range. In southern Illinois, the PVA suggested a 0% chance of  quasi-extinction (90% metapopulation decline) of Swamp Rabbits within 25  (or even 50) years. Changes in fecundity values and the effects of  catastrophic flooding had the greatest effect on extinction risk, and  changes in no other parameter yielded any appreciable impact. Removing  the largest patches from the population increased the 25-year risk of  extinction to 4%, whereas any other modifications to the habitat did not  change the extinction risk (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Roy Nielsen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) found southern Indiana Swamp Rabbits existed as a metapopulation  that appeared to be stable. Metapopulation dynamics were best  characterized as being stationary, but habitat area was an important  factor in extinction rates, occupied patches were significantly larger  than unoccupied patches. In Missouri, more than 50% of available habitat  patches were predicted to contain rabbits after 1000 years, both patch  area and patch isolation were significantly related to patch occupancy  and play key roles in the incidence of Swamp Rabbits (Pajda-De La O <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Decreasing,"Swamp Rabbits occur in the southeastern United States in eastern Texas  and Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, the  western tip of the Florida panhandle, western Georgia, western  Tennessee, far western Kentucky, the northwestern tip of South Carolina,  the southwestern tip of North Carolina, far southern Illinois,  southwestern Indiana, and the south sections of Missouri (Nielsen and  Berkman 2018).<br/><br/>There are two recognized subspecies of Swamp  Rabbits: <em>S. a. littoralis</em>, which occurs in a narrow fragment of habitat  along the southern gulf coastal from Mississippi to Texas, and<em> S. a.  aquaticus</em>, which occupies the northern section of the range and is more  common in dense forest (Chapman and Feldhamer 1981, Chapman and Ceballos  1990).","The species is hunted for sport, meat and fur.",Terrestrial,"Hunting of Swamp Rabbits is managed individually by state wildlife  agencies (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). Because Swamp Rabbits occurs in  many instances on small tracts of private land, management becomes  problematic (Scheibe and Henson 2003).

Additionally, three Mexican forms  appear to be at risk: 1) <em>S. b. exiguus</em> is considered threatened and in  need of immediate conservation actions, its current situation is unknown  and it is probably extinct (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013); 2) it is possible that the southern form <em>S. b. peninsularis</em> may be extinct due to anthropogenic activities (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em>  2013); and 3) <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> from Cedros Island, off the west coast  of Baja California Sur is under intense pressure from predation by feral  dogs, it is listed in danger of extinction in the Official Norm NOM-059  of Mexico (SEMARNAT 2010, Cortés-Calva el al. 2013, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em> 2018, Álvarez-Castañeda and Lorenzo 2016).","The Brush Rabbit requires dense brush cover, occupying disjunctive  bramble clumps, with the size of the clumps affecting home range size  and suitability for occupation (Chapman 1974). Home ranges are small  (less than 2,000 m<sup>2</sup>) and are dependent upon habitat uniformity (Chapman  and Ceballos 1990). The bramble habitat contains runways and  occasionally burrows formed by other species (Chapman and Ceballos  1990). Their diet consists predominantly of grasses, but it will consume  alternative vegetation when seasonally available (Chapman 1974). <br/><br/>The  breeding season for the Brush Rabbit varies from north to south, but  appears to be uniform in length (Chapman 1974). In California, the  species breeds from December to May or June, and in Oregon between  February and August (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). Litter size varies  regionally, with an annual mean of 2.87 in Oregon, 3.50 in north and  central California, and 4.00 in west-central California (Chapman 1974).  Fecundity of the Brush Rabbit is lower than other <em>Sylvilagus </em>species,  producing about 15 young annually (Chapman 1974). Gestation time is  approximately 27 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The  subspecies <em>S. b. riparius</em> occupies both old-growth riparian forest,  dominated by Valley Oak (<em>Quercus lobata</em>) and riparian communities  dominated by thickets of willows (<em>Salix </em>spp.), wild roses (<em>Rosa </em>spp.),  blackberries (<em>Rubus </em>spp.), and other successional trees and shrubs and  when available dense tall stands of herbaceous plants adjacent to  patches of riparian shrubs in the northern San Joaquin Valley,  California. <em>S. b. riparius</em> stays close to dense stands of vegetation  into which it retreats for escape, resting and nesting. They do not  normally burrow or use burrows (Williams and Basey 1986, Williams 1988,  Williams and Hamilton 2002). <em>S. b. riparius</em> eats a great variety of  woody and herbaceous plants, preferring green foliage of shrubs, grasses  and forbs. Much of its foraging is concentrated at the edge between  thickets of woody plants and more open ground with herbaceous plants. A  favored habitat is willow thickets along stream banks (Orr 1940, Chapman  1974, Kelt <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The area of highest abundance of  the Cedros Island Brush Rabbit, <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> is characterized by  xeric scrubland vegetation with dominance of chamizo (<em>Atriplex </em>spp.), in  association with sacrocaule and coastal desert scrub in the southwest  part of the island composed by Limberbush (<em>Jatropha</em> <em>cuneata</em>), Oregano  (<em>Lippia palmeri</em>), Fourwing Saltbush (<em>Atriplex canescens</em>), agaves (<em>Agave  shawii</em>, <em>A. sebastiana</em>) and other shrubs (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em>  2018). <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> shares its habitat with other endemic mammals,  such as the San Diego Pocket Mouse (<em>Chaetodipus</em> <em>fallax anthonyi</em>),  Bryant’s Woodrat (<em>Neotoma bryanti bryanti</em>), the Cedros Island Cactus  Mouse (<em>Peromyscus fraterculus cedrosensis</em>), and Cedros Island Mule Deer  (<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis</em>) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em> 2018). <br/><br/>All  the records of <em>S. bachmani</em> south of 30°N, not including the insular  population (Cedros Island) are associated with mesic vegetation  habitats, some of which are oases (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Hunting for food and the clearing of land for human settlements pose a  threat to Brush Rabbits, but the extent and severity are not quantified  (but see select Mexican subspecies below).<br/><br/>Decline in numbers and  threats of extinction of subspecies <em>S. b. riparius</em> stem principally  from actions involved in developments of irrigated agriculture in the  San Joaquin Valley of California. Foremost of these developments were  stream impoundment, channelization of streams on the valley floor and  the San Joaquin River Delta, and clearing and cultivation of natural  communities. Riparian communities in the San Joaquin Valley have been  reduced to about 1% of their historical extent, are found almost  entirely within the levees of channelized streams. Most existing patches  have been extensively degraded by wood cutting, livestock, invasion of  exotic species, greater levels of flooding within levees, and lack of  natural riverine processes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service 2000).<br/><br/>Principal existing threats to <em>S.  b. riparius</em> can be summarized in order of importance as: 1) stochastic  environmental processes, wildfire and flood; 2) additional habitat loss  and degradation due to urbanization and conversion to agriculture; 3)  increased predation from domestic and feral cats and dogs due to urban  development adjacent to existing inhabited sites; and 4) genetic and  demographic stochasticity in small populations. While all of these are  proximate threats, wildfire and flood are probably the most severe  threats to the population at Caswell MSP. A less imminent threat is  natural successional processes that are reducing habitat quality.  Because the park has multiuse objectives, and because up-stream  impoundments have greatly modified the natural flooding regime,  secondary successional patches, especially those caused by scouring  floods, are disappearing from the Park. The changes are noticeable and  may be associated with the decline in <em>S. b. riparius</em> within the park  (Williams and Hamilton 2002).<br/><br/>For the South Delta metapopulation  of <em>S. b. riparius</em>, wildfire is a serious threat to each subpopulation,  but would unlikely affect all subpopulations simultaneously. Flooding  poses a more immediate metapopulation threat, because the entire area is  approximately at sea level or below, rivers are channelized, and there  are few or no refugia above flood level. Over the past several decades  there have been numerous breaks in levees and widespread flooding. The  most recent were in 1997, 2006, and 2011. Typically, the only areas not  flooded are built-up areas for railroads, levee tops, multilane highways  and other developed sites. Likely these areas will be inundated at some  time in the future when flooding is greater than it has been in recent  decades. Urbanization also is viewed as an imminent threat because most  of the known populations are adjacent to areas undergoing development  planning, with construction slated to begin within 1-10 years. However,  this threat may be mitigated by appropriate design and management of  conservation lands set aside for Brush Rabbits and other organisms  (Williams and Hamilton 2002).<br/><br/>The re-introduced population on the  San Joaquin River NWR, like the populations at Caswell MSP and South  Delta, is threatened by wildfire and flood, but major conservation  actions to mitigate impacts of the flooding have been implemented at the  refuge. See below.<br/><br/><em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> from Cedros Island, off the  west coast of Baja California Sur is under intense pressure from  predation by feral dogs (Cortes-Calva <em>et al.</em> 2013,  Álvarez-Castañeda and Lorenzo 2016). On Cedros Island there is a  population of 2,696 inhabitants, whose main activity is obtaining salt  from the salt flats of Guerrero Negro (INEGI 2010). There are vast areas  covered with organic (lobster shells) and inorganic (glass bottles,  metal material) garbage. Additionally, feral cats (<em>Felis sylvestris</em>) and  feral dogs (<em>Canis lupus</em>) in large numbers occupy also the habitat where  <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> occurs. <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> was abundant about 20 years  ago, however poaching has been excessive and reduced the rabbit  population to a situation that is currently critical (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/><em>S.  b. peninsularis</em> may be extinct or close to extinct due to anthropogenic  activities – the widespread building of infrastructure to support a  growing tourist industry, using all the water of the river for the urban  development, creating more desert areas in which the Desert Cottontail  (<em>Sylvilagus audubonii</em>) is more common (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><em>S.  b. exiguus</em> from the central desert of the Baja California peninsula has  always been rare and now may be declining due the process of  desertification in the peninsula, in which the mesic environment has  been more optimal for desert species such as the Desert Cottontail and  Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>Lepus californicus</em>).","Except for the Riparian Brush Rabbit (subspecies <em>riparius</em>) which is  state (California) and federally listed as endangered (Williams <em>et al.</em>  2004), and the forms <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> on Cedros Island, and <em>S. b.  exiguus</em> and <em>S. b. peninsularis </em>on the Baja California peninsula, the  Brush Rabbit is considered common where it is known to exist, throughout  Oregon, California, and Baja California (Chapman and Ceballos 1990,  Kelly 2018a).<br/><br/>The <em>S. b. riparius</em> population at Caswell Memorial  State Park in San Joaquin County, California, USA, was statistically  estimated in 1993, when there were 241 rabbits (approximate 95%  confidence interval = 170-608) (Williams 1993). Similar censuses were  conducted in 1997-2004, resulting in capture of 0 (1997) to 16 (2002)  rabbits. Capture rates in the best year (2002) were only 27% of that of  1993, and captures and recaptures were too few in any one year since  1993 to use capture-recapture population models to meaningfully estimate  population size (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Population  censuses for the <em>S. b. riparius</em> South Delta metapopulation have not been  conducted because of restrictions on activities on private land.  However, capture rates for short-term assessments of presence and to  capture breeders for a controlled propagation program suggested that  this metapopulation have remained at fairly high densities since its  discovery in 1998. Capture rates for the South Delta metapopulation  varied from 127% to 626% of the capture rate of the Caswell MSP  population in 1993. The South Delta population probably consists of  about 300-600 rabbits at peaks in population cycles).<br/><br/>Censuses  have also not been conducted for the re-introduced population of <em>S. b.  riparius</em> on the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge. However,  visual and camera surveys suggest that the population is quite robust  and now reaches into the thousands when conditions are optimal—due to  the quality and quantity of available habitat.<br/><br/>In 2012 the  population density of <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> was estimated to be 1.21  individuals/km² and the number of individuals estimated as 145 in an  area of 120.7 km² (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014).",Stable,"The Brush Rabbit is distributed along the Pacific coast of North  America. It reaches the Columbia River in the north (Oregon-Washington  border) and in the south it extends to the southern tip of Baja  California. It extends east from the Pacific Ocean to the western Sierra  Nevada mountain range (Chapman 1974, Kelly 2018). It occupies an  elevational range of 0-2,070 m (Chapman 1974).<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>S.  b. riparius</em> occurs only in Caswell Memorial State Park (MSP) on the  Stanislaus River, and the South Delta area of the San Joaquin River,  including Paradise Cut and Tom Paine Slough. The park size is 253 acres,  and population on the South Delta occurs on privately owned land  (Williams and Hamilton 2002). Even though there is other ideal habitat  for <em>S. b. riparius</em> in MSP, they are unable to reach it because there is  no connecting habitat above flood level in MSP (Sandoval, Williams, and  Colliver 2006).<br/><br/>In Caswell Memorial State Park, Stanislaus River,  San Joaquin County, California, USA,<em> S. b. riparius</em> occurs in about 90%  of the park's 102 ha when populations are high, but about 20-40% of the  Park at other times (Williams 1988, 1993).<br/><br/>The South Delta  population of<em> S. b. riparius</em>, in the vicinity of Mossdale and Lathrop,  San Joaquin County, CA, USA, exists on about 122 ha of private land  within an area of about 2,927 ha. Populations are found along Paradise  Cut, Tom Paine Slough, Grantline Canal, and the San Joaquin River.  Rabbits also are found along the narrow right-of-ways of two railroads  running through the area. Habitat for <em>S. b. riparius</em> is distributed in  discontinuous, narrow strands of riparian vegetation along streams,  sloughs, and railroad beds adjacent to intensely cultivated fields. Most  land in this area is planned for urban and industrial development  within the next 1-10 years. Existing habitat is periodically cut or  burned for weed and flood control (Williams and Hamilton 2002).<br/><br/>The  re-introduced population of <em>S. b. riparius</em> is located in the San  Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge in Stanislaus County, California.  This refuge has about 285 ha of habitat for Brush Rabbits. An  additional few hundred hectares have been restored from cropland to  natural, riparian vegetation. Refugia from flooding, vegetated mounds  and berms, have also been established throughout the refuge for rabbits  and other terrestrial wildlife (Kelly 2018a, b).<br/><br/>The former range  of <em>S. b. peninsularis</em> was from the Magdalena Bay region to the tip of  the Baja California peninsula, although specimens are known only from  two localities, Santa Anita and Cabo San Lucas separated by only 32 km.  Recent intensive field work failed to locate any of the rabbits, and the  area has been severely modified by tourist developments. The last known  specimens of this subspecies were obtained only in the first quarter of  the 20th century (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>The range of <em>S.  b. exiguus</em> is in the central desert of the Baja California peninsula,  where it is known from only eight localities. While recent intensive  surveys have found desert cottontail rabbits to be common, no Brush  Rabbits were observed at these sites. While the region only exhibits low  human impact, it nevertheless appears that the exiguus subspecies is of  conservation concern (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><em>S. b.  cerrosensis</em> is restricted to lowlands of Cedros Island, Baja California  on the Pacific-north coast of Mexico. Cedros Island is a “mountain in  the sea” so less than the 15% of the island is optimal habitat for <em>S. b.  cerrosensis</em>, in addition with the presence of packs of feral dogs that  in recent years have been controlled.","This species is hunted for food and sport. &lt;2-5% of the total  population is utilized, because their brushy preferred habitat is  unsuitable for hunting.",Terrestrial,"There are no known conservation measures in place for the species as a whole.<br/><br/>The  San Joaquin Valley population of subspecies <em>S. b. riparius </em>has been  listed by the state of California as an endangered species (U. S. Fish  and Wildlife Service 2000), and has been the subject of a recovery plan  involving habitat management and captive breeding (U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service 1998, Kelly 2018b).<br/><br/>The following timeline includes recent conservation measures implemented for <em>S. b. riparius</em>:<br/>1) Distribution and status review in 1986 (Williams and Basey 1986).<br/>2) Listing as a California Species of Special Concern (Williams and Basey 1986).<br/>3) Ecology and habitat management plan for Caswell Memorial State Park developed (Williams 1988).<br/>4) Populations estimate made for Caswell MSP in 1993, the only known population at the time (Williams 1993).<br/>5) Listed as an endangered species by the State of California in 1994 (State of California 1994).<br/>6)  Featured species in the multi-species Recovery Plan for Upland Species  of the San Joaquin Valley, California (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  1998).<br/>7) Habitat management plan focused on wildfire and flooding developed (Close and Williams 1998).<br/>8) Listed as a USA endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2002 (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>9)  Controlled Propagation and Reintroduction Plan for Riparian Brush  Rabbits developed for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Williams and  Hamilton 2002).<br/>10) Habitat acquisition and restoration begun by  multi-agency CalFed Program with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the  land owner and manager, starting in 2000 and continuing to date  (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>11) Controlled propagation facility constructed beginning in 2001 and completed in 2002 by U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>12)  Controlled propagation of Riparian Brush Rabbits initiated in December  2001 with 3 males and 3 females in one large outdoor pen that contained  semi-natural habitat conditions (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>13)  The re-introduced population of Riparian Brush Rabbits on the San  Joaquin River NWR was started with the release of 49 young rabbits from  the controlled propagation facility between July and October 2002  (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>14) By the end of 2002, controlled  propagation expanded to three breeding pens resulting in larger numbers  of rabbits being released on the refuge, many fitted with radio-collars  to get detailed information on survivorship, dispersal, and habitat use  (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2008, Hamilton <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kelt <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/>15)  Major spring flooding of the San Joaquin River in 2006 resulted in the  mortality of nearly all Brush Rabbits on the refuge. The extent and  severity of flooding was mapped so that locations could be chosen for  the placement of large mounds of dirt that would be vegetated with  brushy species and thereby serve as temporary refuges for rabbits during  floods. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also vegetated miles of bare  river levees on the refuge with brushy species to provide additional  upland cover for the rabbits (Kelly 2018b).<br/>16) Major spring flooding  of the San Joaquin River occurred again in 2011 and 2017, but because  of the habitat management restoration measures taken following the 2006  flood, the population rebounded quickly in both years and despite high  levels of flood-related mortality (Kelly 2018b).<br/>17) In late 2005 and  early 2006, rabbits were also released on the privately owned Faith  Ranch, which is under conservation easement, and runs downriver along  the San Joaquin River from the refuge boundary towards Caswell MSP.  Later in 2006, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the  Buffington property, which connects the Faith Ranch to Caswell MSP,  thereby creating more than 20 continuous river-miles of riparian habitat  for the Brush Rabbit (Kelly 2018b).<br/>18) By the time the breeding and  reintroduction program was suspended in December 2013, a total of 1,496  Riparian Brush Rabbits had been released on the refuge, that includes  releases on the Faith Ranch and the Buffington property (Kelly 2018b).<br/>19) The rabbit populations at Caswell MSP and on the San Joaquin River NWR continue to be monitored (Kelly 2018b).<br/><br/>Although  <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> is fully protected on Cedros Island, along with all  native wildlife (SEMARNAT 2010), there is an urgent need to assess the  pressures of habitat destruction and poaching on this subspecies. Cedros  Island needs to correct its management of open industrial garbage dumps  and to eradicate feral cats and dogs as soon as possible. The control  of feral dogs began at the end of 1980 by personnel of the National  Institute of Ecology in collaboration with local fishermen (McChesney  and Tershy 1998), but the dogs were not eradicated because the effort  was not constant. It is necessary to document the impact of exotic  species of native fauna of Cedros Island. It is necessary to develop  research projects to determine population dynamics, reproduction,  ethology and other aspects of the biology and ecology of this subspecies  (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/><em>S.  b. cerrosensis</em> is an endangered subspecies according to the Official  Norm NOM-059 of Mexico (SEMARNAT 2010). This subspecies has drastically  declined because of habitat modification. The effort made to evaluate  the status of this subspecies has been sufficient to consider it  extinct.<br/><br/><em>S. b. exiguus</em> is threatened. All these subspecies should  be added to national and international lists of protected species  (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It prefers rocky  hillsides and outcroppings, and ""rock crevices and boulders are an  essential component of the habitat"" (Happold 2013). Where its range  overlaps with Jameson’s Red Rock Hare (<em>P. randensis</em>), it occurs at  higher elevations in areas that have fewer boulders and crevices and  higher rainfall (Happold 2013). Habitat loss has been occurring over the  last 100 years and is anticipated to continue to decline in total area  by &lt;20% over the next 20 years due to commercial plantations (Matthee  <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>While not much is known about the  reproduction of this species, it is likely to be similar to other red  rock hares. Breeding is restricted to warmer months during which time a  female could produce three to four litters of one to two altricial  (naked) young on each occasion (Matthee <em>et al.</em> 2016). Total length ranges from 38.0–53.5cm (Happold 2013).","The main threat to rock hares is hunting, both for bushmeat and for  sport. Hunting pressure is thought to be more severe in areas of  high-density human settlements. For example in Lesotho, it is threatened  due to hunting pressure from herders with pack dogs (Lynch 1994).  Additionally, agricultural and rural settlement expansion may be  increasing incidental predation on rock hares by domestic dogs. Hunting  is suspected to be causing local declines (and possibly local  extinctions), but it is uncertain whether there is a net decline in the  population. Long-term monitoring should be established to quantify  subpopulation trends.","Populations are considered fairly abundant throughout its distribution  (Happold 2013), but rarely collected (Lynch 1989). Population for  Hewitt’s Red Rock Hare has been estimated at &gt;10,000 mature  individuals (Matthee <em>et al.</em> 2004). The population is  characterized as having declined in the past, and is predicted to  continue declining in the future at a rate of &lt;10% over the next 20  years (Matthee <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Unknown,"Hewitt’s Red Rock Hare is endemic to southern Africa (Happold 2013).

It is likely to be fairly important in subsistence communities where they are easily obtained. Malieha (1993) specifically mentioned rock hares as being an important bush meat item in Lesotho and in Zululand, but this is likely to be true throughout its range. As a fairly slow-moving species, they are easily hunted with dogs. At night, they have a tendency to freeze when chanced upon in spotlights and can be easily shot or captured in nets (B. Wilson pers. obs.). During the day, it is also possible to hunt them in their refuges, using a coiled piece of barbed wire that hooks and drags the animal out of its shelter (B. Wilson pers. obs.).

45196929,4806,Chrotogale owstoni,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered A2bcd, A3bcd, A4cd because of an ongoing population decline, inferred to exceed 50% over the last three generations (taken as 15 years) and suspected to continue for the next three. This is inferred from over-exploitation, with habitat fragmentation exacerbating the speed at which the species is being extirpated. Hunting is a severe threat because the species is primarily ground-dwelling and so is exposed to the very high levels of snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping throughout its range. This assessment is made without any direct quantification of decline rate. Two largely sympatric ungulates&#160;of broadly similar generation lengths, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, are proposed as Critically Endangered under the same criteria for the same reasons. Owston's Civet has always been and remains more widespread than them, and unlike them there is still evidence of&#160;several&#160;high-density&#160;Owston's Civet&#160;populations. While this does not necessarily mean the civet's overall population decline rate is lower, the lower category for Owston's Civet is assigned based on its wider occurrence in montane forest (in which this civet is known to live, in some areas commonly, and up to 2,600 m) and karst (which is predicted to hold viable populations). These habitats, which contain some areas of very rugged and/or highland terrain into which industrial snaring has not yet widely spread, are apparently not occupied by the two ungulates. If market forces drive intensive snaring also into these habitats, then Critically Endangered would be the appropriate category for future decline rates of Owston's Civet given its apparent rapid extirpation across some heavily snared parts of Viet Nam.","Owston’s Civet occurs in a variety of habitats, all within evergreen biomes, linked by the common feature of a non-harsh dry season. It is, or was, much more widely spread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, reflecting the much larger area of Viet Nam with significant humidity in the driest months (i.e., lacking a harsh dry season).&#160;The pattern of locality records in Lao PDR where the species is evidently naturally localised&#160;quite clearly shows that the species has a narrow&#160;habitat usage. Areas with&#160;a non-harsh dry season&#160;in Lao PDR are restricted (Timmins and Trinh 2001).&#160;The areas providing high encounter rates of Owston's Civet in Lao PDR are adjacent to low sections of the Annamite spine (the north-south mountain range forming much of the international border between Lao PDR and Viet Nam) that allow moisture-bearing winds from Viet Nam during Lao PDR's dry season, which in the rest of the country is harsh at lower and mid altitudes (Timmins and Trinh 2001, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Sivilay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Many other evergreen forest survey areas across the country lack records,&#160;despite the use therein of methods suitable to find the species, at adequate intensities, and the finding of multiple hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling mammals,&#160;It is essentially absent from the predominant evergreen forest types of Lao PDR, lowland, mid-elevation and lower montane semi-evergreen (dry evergreen) and lower montane forests. This is based on spotlighting in several survey areas supporting these forest types in the early - mid 1990s (Duckworth 1997) and on camera-trapping in the 21st century in Phou Sithon, Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), Laving-Laveun NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area and Xe Sap NBCA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the hunting intensity in all of these at the time of camera-trapping was equivalent to Pu Mat before (sometimes well before) 1998, about when the species was still readily detected by camera-traps. It is evidently locally present in Lao PDR below 1,000 m where wet evergreen forest occurs, but the absence of records from Laving-Laveun NBCA, which holds various other wet&#160;evergreen forest species,&#160;suggests that Owston's Civet is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. It also occurs in montane evergreen forest (over 1,000 m), but is probably equally restricted by climatic conditions in its geographic and altitudinal range. Montane areas&#160;with wet climates, such as various high peaks in eastern parts of Lao PDR, appear to support the species over a relatively wide range (e.g., Xe Sap NBCA; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whilst peaks further west (greater rain-shadowing during the winter) appear to support more localised populations (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wet evergreen forest is, or was, far more widespread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, but it is not universal. The strong evidence from Lao PDR for climatic sensitivity of Owston's Civet suggests that some Viet Namese evergreen forests will hold the species sparsely or not at all (those in a&#160;rain-shadow).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Annamite wet evergreen forest of Lao PDR, Owston's Civet has been recorded as high as suitable survey has occurred (1,500 m; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The few records from Lao PDR's northern highlands, mostly imprecisely located (barring that in Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009), are likely to come from higher altitudes where the colder temperatures ameliorate the low dry-season rainfall. Thus, in Lao PDR Owston's Civet is likely to occur&#160;mostly in hill and montane altitudes, although there are credible reports from as low as 550 m (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whereas in Viet Nam the species has a wide altitudinal range, right down to the plains and up to 2,600 m (Van Ban district, Lao Kay province, in 2002; S. Swan pers. comm. 2014). Recent camera-trap records at&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, in the northern highlands of Viet Nam, come from altitudes of 1,722-2,444 m a.s.l.; there was very little survey effort below 1,700 m (B.M. Rawson pers, comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Captive animals in both Viet Nam and the U.K. relish earthworms (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014) and the species's skull and dentition suggest an invertebrate diet (Thomas 1927). An earthworm-dominated diet would explain the tight linkage with year-round humidity, given that in the parts of Lao PDR with a harsh dry season earthworms are not accessible during that season. This remains purely speculative, especially given that the component of Owston's Civet range south of the northern highlands resembles that of various other species unlikely to depend directly on access to earthworms, e.g. Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>&#160;and Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>.<br/><br/>Suitable forests, in Viet Nam at least, include some on limestone and some dominated by bamboo (Roberton 2007). There are indications from Lao PDR of occurrence in degraded and edge habitat such as banana gardens (King 2002), but these remain to be confirmed. The lack of records from deciduous forest surely reflects the genuine pattern of occurrence.<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has not been studied in the field, but camera-trapping indicates that it is nocturnal, largely solitary and presumably largely active at ground level (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), although there is at least one record of a wild animal 3 m up a tree (Dang and Le 2010). The species climbs well in captivity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).","Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the two countries holding most of the geographic range of Owston's Civet, have among the highest levels of non-specific mammal hunting in the world. For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats <em>Panthera</em>, wild cattle <em>Bos</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs,&#160;rather than by passive trapping; and it is&#160;by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.<br/><br/>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.<br/><br/>The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the&#160;species&#160;depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.","The total population of Owston's Civet will always have been much smaller than that of most other mainland South-east Asian civets because it has such a small geographic range. There is insufficient&#160;baseline information to define the precise&#160;range and even the general abundance in the era before trade-driven hunting began to accelerate steeply in the 1980s with the increasingly wide deployment of cable-snares in long lines linked by brushwood drift fences. Therefore, its population trend needs to be inferred from trends in habitat and in hunting (types, distributions and intensities), based on a hypothesised geographic and ecological distribution, itself inferred from habitat (from which the known precisely located records come) and distributions of ecologically restricted co-occurring species.<br/><br/>Severe declines probably started in the early 1990s, Around this time, evidence suggests other ground-dwelling, now much-declined, Annamite-centred species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> and&#160;Edwards’s Pheasant <em>Lophura edwardsii</em>&#160;were, by today’s standards, still common in accessible Viet Namese forests. Camera-trapping in the late 1990s in Pu Mat Nature Reserve and in Huong Son district (SFNC 2000, Timmins and Trinh 2001) suggested that the species was still relatively common in mid-elevation forests where hunting pressure was already relatively intense. The number of animals in trade in the 1990s (e.g., at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in Lao PDR; received by the Owston’s Civet Project at&#160;Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam; and observed in trade near Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and as&#160;stuffed specimens along route 1, both Viet Nam) all suggest the species was frequent thereabouts, presumably in the mid-elevation forest where the bulk of snaring was then taking place. There is no pointer, when the difficulties of detecting this species by typical pre-camera-trap surveys are accounted for, to suggest that Owston’s Civet was not a common species throughout mid-elevation Vietnamese wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section), prior to the advent of intensive snaring.<br/><br/>Within its range, it evidently reached, and locally still reaches, high densities within favoured habitat. Bourret (1944) considered it to be the most common civet between the Fansipan mountains and the Black river in northern Viet Nam. Two camera-trapping surveys in Viet Nam around the turn of the century, one in the Hoang Lien mountains in the north-west of the country and the other in Pu Mat Nature Reserve in the northern Annamites found this civet to be among the most commonly photographed small carnivores in these areas (SFNC 2000, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004). Pu Mat NR has not been resurveyed, but this assessment&#160;is still appropriate for the highland areas of Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, both in/near the Hoan Lien mountains, in 2013 camera-trapping (B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). The same was found in 2012-2013 in Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b) and during the preceding decade in parts of eastern Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In some other areas that it has been found, it has been among the least recorded species by camera-trap, e.g. Quang Nam province, Viet Nam (Long and Minh 2006), western Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Nam Et-Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The patterns&#160;of the other hunting-sensitive species recorded by these surveys suggest that Owston's Civet abundance is highly heterogeneous dependent upon habitat, not that the low encounter rates in these areas are&#160;solely a result of overhunting (although this&#160;might be responsible in part or whole for the low encounter rate in Quang Nam).<br/><br/>However, hunting is likely to be the explanation for the stark temporal pattern shown by the review of camera-trapping in Viet Nam by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Of the five camera-trapping surveys operating in Viet Nam during&#160;1998–2006, all found Owston’s &#160;Civet; the four in 2006–2013 all did not. (Two additional sites surveyed in the latter period, Cat Tien NP and U Minh, also did not find&#160;Owston’s Civet but are excluded from the comparison as being outside the species's likely range.) Very recent (late 2013) camera-trapping in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve (Kon Tum province, Viet Nam) and two northern highland sites,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, found Owston's Civet to be one of most commonly photographed small carnivores (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014,&#160;B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). These anomalies within the 2006-2013 time period, not available in time for the Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) review, are both in very mountainous areas consequently less economically appealing to market hunters. Higher hunting pressures, notably snaring intensities, typify most of the survey areas included in Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Excepting the results from Ngoc Linh NR,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, the lack of Viet Namese records from 2006 onwards suggests a major recent decline in the species in sites across the country with large populations&#160;left only in forested steep highland massifs. This suspected decline&#160;is corroborated by the failure of over 15,000 camera-trap-nights of effort in wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves, Viet Nam, since August 2012 to find the species (WWF pers. comm. to Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Nor has it been found in another lowland area of wet&#160;evergreen forest, Khe Nuoc Truong in Quang Binh province, where extensive camera-trapping recorded many other small carnivore species (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014). For none of these 2006-2013 Viet Nam camera-trap survey areas is there evidence of a pre-intensive-snaring large population of Owston' Civet. However, assessing them based on habitat and other Annamite wet evergreen forest species' status (see 'Habitats and ecology' section; R.J. Timmins [pers. comm. 2014] has&#160;surveyed in most of them and studied all on aerial imagery), Khe Nuoc Truong, Hoang Son, and non-limestone forests in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang area,&#160;are&#160;probably&#160;prime Owston’s Civet habitat; Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves are very similar to Pu Mat NR; and Ke Go is hard to know, because few other sites are topographically similar, and the topography influences local climate. Even Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>&#160;(among the least hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling wet evergreen forest species)&#160;has not been camera-trapped in the&#160;Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves;&#160;they are some of the most heavily hunted large forest blocks that R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014) has&#160;ever been to.<br/><br/>A decline of such magnitude was not suspected during the last Red List assessment for this species, for 2008. At that stage, all camera-trap surveys within its range typically found the species, sometimes commonly. The high encounter rates in some areas suggests a high starting population and thus a long time until near extirpation (and the concomitant ability of generalised camera-trapping to note a paucity of records). Another factor weighed for the 2008 listing as Vulnerable was that one of the surveys camera-trapping the species commonly, in Hoang Lien Son of far northern Viet Nam, was amid highly degraded and fragmented forest which had been subjected to high levels of traditional hunting for decades (see Swan and O'Reilly 2004) and thus the species was resilient to hunting pressure. However, it now seems more likely that Owston's Civet differs in sensitivity to different styles of hunting (see 'Threats'). The current overall population trend is thus assessed to be steeply downwards. Probably, the main phase of decline in Viet Nam has already occurred, with most areas holding the species there now having only low numbers with large populations persisting only in the northern highlands and most rugged part of the Annamites, Lao PDR, retaining much larger areas of forest without road incursion and a much lower human population, still retains at least one large population, plausibly several (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), but the national trend in 2015-2030 is likely to replicate that of Viet Nam in 1999-2014.<br/><br/>No information on the present population status in the Chinese part of the range was traced. Indeed, it is not clear that the species is still extant there.",Decreasing,"Owston's Civet is known to occur across a wide latitudinal range of both eastern Lao PDR (Sivilay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) and Viet Nam (Roberton&#160;2007,&#160;Dang and Le 2010), and in a small area of southernmost China, possibly only in Hekou, Luchun and Jinping counties of Yunnan province (Wang Ying-xiang 2003) but perhaps also in adjacent Guangxi province (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has not been found west of the Mekong river (Corbet and Hill 1992) and indeed occurrence in Lao PDR is restricted largely to the easternmost areas that have similarities in climate to Viet Nam. The range may also potentially extend into easternmost Cambodia: two individuals seen in the Phnom Tamao zoo (Phnom Penh) collection of stuffed mounts in the late 1990s were unlikely to have originated outside Cambodia (C.M. Poole pers. comm. to Dang and Le 2010). However, extensive surveys in Cambodia's eastern provinces have not found the species (e.g., Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, E.H.B. Pollard pers. comm. 2012). Perhaps the most likely area of Cambodia, eastern Virachey National Park, remains very little camera-trapped. Suitable methodology (camera-trapping and/or spotlighting) has been applied widely enough in the southern half of Lao PDR to be confident the species is entirely or largely restricted to the east in the south and latitudinal centre; capable searches have been less widespread in the northern highlands.<br/><br/>Records come from the range 100-2,600 m, but, particularly west of the Annamites, only a subset of this full range is likely to be occupied in any given area (see 'Habitats and ecology').","Owston's Civet is taken for meat and traditional medicine (including its bones, scent gland, and penis) in all of its range countries; there is not suspected to be any targeted hunting of the species, but much hunting in its range is non-selective (e.g. snares) to supply the general wildlife meat market (Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;B. Long&#160;pers. comm. 2006,&#160;S.I. Roberton pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered on the China Red List and as Vulnerable in the Viet Nam Red Book (MOSTE 2000). It is protected in Yunnan province, but not in Guangxi (GMA Small Carnivore Workshop 2006). In Viet Nam the species is listed in group IIB meaning exploitation is regulated but not prohibited (Decree 32/2006/ND-CP). In Lao PDR, the species is listed in group I (Prohibition category) of the hunting regulations (Prime Minister Decree 81, 2008; Wildlife hunting regulation).<br/><br/>An international breeding programme, coordinated from Viet Nam, has been established with populations in Europe and Viet Nam. However numbers are still too low for long-term viability (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has been recorded in many protected areas in Viet Nam and several in Lao PDR (Roberton 2007, Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) but in none of these is trade-driven snaring yet under effective control. They have, however, somewhat to greatly slowed the expansion of the road system, and thus maintained areas in which it is only marginally economically viable to harvest wildlife meat in bulk; and they have reduced the chance of landscape-level habitat transformation projects such as concession plantations.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45198537,9561,Gulo gulo,Least Concern,,2016,2015-05-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The&#160;Wolverine&#160;is listed as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, remaining large populations, and the unlikelihood that it is in decline at a rate fast enough to trigger even Near Threatened. It occurs at low density and many populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (Ruggiero <em>et al</em>. 2007). There have been large past declines in some of its range but there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (Rowland <em>et al</em>. 2003). Thus although there is an overall continued decline due to human persecution and land-use change, the global decline of this species is not at a rate sufficient to qualify for categorisation&#160;even as&#160;Near Threatened&#160;as of 2015. However, in the mid-2000s&#160;the European Mammal Assessment determined that the European populations&#160;of Wolverine were in&#160;steep decline and would warrant a category of&#160;Vulnerable (A2c). Thus, the Least Concern global listing is driven by the large populations which remain in northern Asia and North America. Wolverine still faces&#160;some threats such as over-exploitation through hunting and trapping, predator-poisoning programmes and habitat resource extraction that caused the contraction of its&#160;historical range. More data on population trends, especially in northern Asia, might result in this species being re-assessed as Near Threatened or even Vulnerable in the near future.","The Wolverine inhabits&#160;a variety of habitats in the alpine, tundra, taiga, and boreal forest zones, including coniferous, mixed, and deciduous woodlands, bogs, and open mountain as well as tundra habitats (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em> 1999). Snow is generally regarded as an important component of its seasonal habitat requirements (Banci 1987, Hatler 1989). Wolverine habitat selection is negatively affected by human activity, including roads, infrastructure, and back-country recreation (May <em>et al.</em> 2006; Krebs <em>et al</em>. 2007). It has vast home-ranges (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1998), varying from 100 to 500 km²&#160;for males and 100 to 200 km² for females, and good dispersal abilities. Faecal DNA sampling has detected dispersal distances of more than 500 km (Flagstad 2005, Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2006). Hornocker <em>et al</em>. (1983) considered this species to be solitary, with large home ranges and extensive seasonal movements. It is largely nocturnal with some daylight activity&#160;(Whitman 1999).<br/><br/>The Wolverine has&#160;an average life expectancy of 4 to 6 years in the wild, with a maximum of about 13 years (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995). It reaches sexual maturity at 2.5 years. It breeds&#160;in early spring to late autumn with litters of 1-5 young (mean litter size: 3) born between February and April (Whitman 1999). <br/><br/>The Wolverine is&#160;thought to have evolved to scavenge from the kills of wild ungulates abandoned by other carnivores such as lynx <em>Lynx</em> and Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupu</em>s, as well prey animals felled by disease or injury. It also actively hunts&#160;smaller animals such as rodents, hares <em>Lepus</em>, musk-deer <em>Moschus</em>, roe <em>Capreolus</em>&#160;and wild sheep <em>Ovis</em>. Given the appropriate snow conditions it will also hunt larger animals such as moose <em>Alces</em>. Conflicts arise when Wolverines prey on livestock such as sheep or Reindeer. Given its&#160;dependence on other hunters for much of its scavenged food, the Wolverines is&#160;able to carry and cache large amounts of meat for later consumption.","Within its&#160;current range, extensive human activities continue to pressure Wolverine populations and habitat (Krebs <em>et al.</em> 2004). Overhunting (often by trapping), as well as predator-poisoning programs and resource extraction caused Wolverine populations to contract in the eastern and south-western portions of the&#160;species's&#160;historical range in North America since the early 1900s (Banci 1994).<br/><br/>The Wolverine is potentially locally threatened by its&#160;fragmented distribution and presumed low genetic diversity, as well as by 'population control' hunting and other consequences of perceived&#160;conflicts with people resulting from depredation of livestock. While this species inhabits a zone that is particularly affected by climate change (Rosenzweig <em>et al</em>. 2007), habitat change is not fast enough to be considered a major threat to it in the next three generations. Ample forest and tundra with suitable prey stocks are available throughout much of its range. A low rate of human land-use expansion into this range increases&#160;the frequency of interaction people, notably in conflict over livestock depredation. Given the remoteness of these locations, tolerance of Wolverines taking livestock is low and in some areas 'population control' hunting is used as a proactive means to avoid loss of animals. In Norway, where almost 10,000 sheep are believed to be killed by Wolverines each summer, government committees have instituted annual harvest quotas in an effort to control livestock losses; however, these quotas may not be sustainable as they are set very high even in relation to the most liberal estimate of Wolverine population size, and it is unclear whether this hunt actually reduces the numbers of sheep and semi-domestic deer lost to predators. <br/><br/>Wolverines are scarce in Europe today. Their continued survival is threatened because of their small and fragmented distribution, and the potential for their future survival may be weakened by the likelihood of low genetic diversity. Habitat loss <em>per se</em> is not a substantial threat. Large areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland are still covered by forests and mountains that offer a suitable prey base and habitat for Wolverine. These are not wilderness areas, and the&#160;species&#160;comes&#160;into conflict with a low, but crucial, number of human land uses. There are no large areas within&#160;Wolverine&#160;distribution with no livestock&#160;conflict potential. This results in a difficult situation for wildlife managers who are forced to try and balance Wolverine conservation against the conflicts with livestock. In Norway, farmers no longer use traditional sheep-herding methods that once deterred depredation, so Wolverines are often controlled in an effort to protect livestock. Poaching also occurs. In Russia, over-harvesting and declines in key prey species are threats.<br/><br/>1 and 2. The Scandinavian and&#160;southern Norwegian&#160;populations are subject to illegal killings because of depredation conflicts (sheep, domestic reindeer). The scope of this is difficult to quantify. Furthermore Wolverines are sensitive to human disturbance (settlements, public and private roads, etc.) especially near their dens (May <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;Most people in Norway are settled in southern Norway.<br/><br/>3. In the Swedish forest population/occurrence, high genetic similarity among individuals in the two areas indicates inbreeding, possibly including brother-sister matings (Hedmark 2006). Inbreeding depression and demographic stochasticity are therefore likely to be threats (Pimm <em>et al</em>. 1988). These forest dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of 'domestic' Reindeer, which form the most common prey for Wolverines further north (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1997). Establishment in the forest landscape is judged to be a way of reducing Wolverine&#160;conflict with the domestic Reindeer industry (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>4. In the Finnish – Western Russian population, about half the Finnish population lives&#160;within the Reindeer management area in the north (Kojola 2005), in conflict with this&#160;industry (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b) with associated illegal killings. The scope of this is unknown. The Russian economic depression during the 1990s is believed to have led to widespread poaching of ungulates, and to a reduction of the domestic reindeer herding industry through large calf/breeding losses. This is believed to have indirectly reduced the Wolverine’s&#160;numbers and distribution&#160;in the European and most human-populated part of Russia (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2000a, 2000b; Novikov 2005). In Russia the Wolverine is harvested for fur, apparently without harvest restrictions. Russia has not yet ratified the Bern Convention. <br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population is small and presumably isolated: it is likely that it will face inbreeding problems (Hedmark 2006) as well as being exposed to demographic stochasticity (Pimm <em>et al</em>. 1988). Inbreeding depression and demographic accidents are therefore main threats, especially because&#160;these forest-dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of semi domesticated reindeer.","Wolverine&#160;distribution and abundance reduced&#160;notably&#160;in the 20th century in the United States of America (Pasitschniak-Arts and Larivière 1995), and during the 19th century, species&#160;disappeared from the south of its European distribution mainly through persecution, but also because of deforestation and other human developments. After this&#160;substantial range reduction, there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (Rowland <em>et al.</em> 2003). Throughout its&#160;range, Wolverine occurs&#160;at relatively low densities and requires&#160;large home ranges, typically of 100-600 km² (Whitman 1999). Densities are never high&#160;(Makridin 1964,&#160;Aubry&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007), and it has been found to be less abundant than is Grey Wolf <em>Canis&#160;lupus</em>, even in optimal habitats (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995). Densities range from one per 500 km² in Scandinavia to one per 65 km² in Montana, USA (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995).<br/><br/>In North America,&#160;substantial populations occur in northern Canada and Alaska. In the USA outside Alaska, the population in Montana is considered to be the largest and most stable one, given its close proximity to healthy populations in Canada (Cegelski <em>et al</em>. 2003). Many wolverine populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (Ruggiero <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In North America, population density estimates range from one animal per 65 km²&#160;in Montana (Hornocker and Hash 1981) to one per 200 km²&#160;in northern British Columbia (Quick 1953), Alaska (Becker and Gardner 1992), and the Northwest Territories (Lee and Niptanatiak 1993). Lofroth and Krebs (2007) estimated densities in British Columbia using existing Wolverine distribution, Wolverine food, ecosystem mapping and human development data. Estimates ranged from 6.2 Wolverines/1,000 km²&#160;in high-quality habitat to 0.3/1,000 km²in low-quality habitat. Their total population estimated for British Columbia was 3,530 Wolverines.<br/><br/>The European population was recently&#160;estimated at approximately 2,260 individuals: 1,400 in European Russia (Novikov 2005), 150 in Finland, 326 (±45) individuals in Sweden and 269 (±32) individuals in Norway (Sæther <em>et al</em>. 2005). The southern Norwegian population was naturally re-established during the late 1970s and was a result of protective legalisation (Landa and Skogland 1995). To the east, the eastern Russian Wolverine population is believed to comprise more than 18,000 individuals (Novikov 2005). The species is not abundant in Mongolia, but still relatively widespread: it is only found in northern taiga habitats in Hentii and Hövsgöl mountain ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamsteren 1970), northern parts of Hangai Mountain Range and Mongol Altai Mountain Range (Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989). The European distribution is connected to the eastern Russian population along the Urals. The overall European population forms a relatively continuous distribution with five geographically distinct subpopulations. <br/><br/>1. The Scandinavian population has shown a low genetic variability and subdivision among populations indicating that the Wolverine in Scandinavia has lost variation through a previous bottleneck and that the current populations are the result of a recent common genetic background (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2001, Flagstad <em>et al.</em> 2004). A recent population estimate is of 580 individuals (at or over one year of age) with approximately 200 in Norway and 380 in Sweden (Larsson 2005, van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2005). The population has a continuous distribution and is narrowly connected to the Finnish – western Russian population along the border of the country of Finnmark in the northernmost parts of this population's&#160;distribution. An initial genetic analysis indicated a clear genetic distinction between these populations (Ø. Flagststad <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006). In its southern distribution, the Scandinavian population is a source for the&#160;southern Norwegian population (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2001; Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006) as well as a source for the Swedish forest population(s) close to the Gulf of Bothnia in&#160;southern Sweden (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>2. The&#160;southern Norwegian population was naturally re-established during the late 1970s and was a result of protective legalisation (Landa and Skogland 1995). This population has recently increased in numbers and distribution, but is currently kept at around 100 individuals by various control measurements (Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2006). Genetic surveys have shown that the&#160;southern Norwegian population is genetically distinct from the Scandinavian population, but the geographic gap between the southern and the main Scandinavian population to the north and east decreased from 100-200 km by the early 1990s to near-connectivity by 2006. Exchange of individuals is limited and the&#160;southern Norwegian population seems to form a sink (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b, Flagstad <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).<br/><br/>3. Swedish forest Wolverine occurrences were naturally established during the mid 1990s (Hedmark 2006). These new occurrences, in two localities,&#160;were probably established by as few as 2 and 2-4 individuals respectively,&#160;and by the mid 2000s&#160;consisted of  2 and 10 individuals, respectively (Hedmark 2006). Non-invasive genetic surveys showed that these occurrences have little, if any, contact with the main Scandinavian wolverine population (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>4. The Finnish – western Russian population, in recent decades, increased in&#160;size&#160;and distribution in Finland, but decreased in Russia (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b). The western Russian population is estimated to be approximately 1,400 individuals (Novikov 2005). To the west this&#160;population is narrowly connected to the Scandinavian population along common borders with Norway and Sweden. Initial genetic analysis indicated a clear genetic distinction between the Scandinavian population and the Wolverines in northern Finland (Ø. Flagststad <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006). It is unclear how the western part of this population (Finland, Kola, Karelia) connects along the narrow isthmus between the White Sea and Lake Onega in Western Russia. This area is judged as an extremely important connection for the northern element of the taiga fauna (Lindén <em>et al</em>. 2000) and these concerns should be further investigated. To the east, the European Russian population has a wide connection to the much larger eastern Russian population adjoining along the Urals in western Siberia. The eastern Russian population is believed to comprise more than 18,000 individuals (Novikov 2005). <br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population was established by translocating&#160;Wolverines from domestic Reindeer <em>Rangier tarandus</em>&#160;herding areas in the north during the 1980s-1990s. It is estimated to comprise&#160;about 10-15 individuals and seems to reproduce naturally (Kojola 2005). The gap between this and the Karelia distribution is about 200-300 km and little is known about exchange between these populations. This population should be judged as isolated from other populations pending further knowledge.",Decreasing,"Wolverine&#160;has a circumpolar distribution, corresponding with the Boreal zone of the northern hemisphere (Kvam <em>et al.</em> 1988). Its&#160;resident&#160;range reaches from Scandinavia across&#160;the Russian Federation (including Siberia),&#160;Mongolia,&#160;and northern&#160;China (provinces of&#160;Heilongiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia)&#160;to Alaska (USA), Canada and the western lower states of the United States of America (Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon and California)&#160;(Whitman 1999).&#160;During the 19th century, Wolverine disappeared from its&#160;southernmost European range mainly through persecution, but also because of&#160;deforestation and other human developments. In Europe the species is now found, mainly&#160;north of 60ºN, in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the European part of Russia.&#160;It is a rare vagrant (from Russia)&#160;to&#160;Estonia (T. Maran <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>It has been recorded over the altitudinal range of at least 300-2,400 m a.s.l.","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"The Wolverine is recorded from a number of protected areas. However, beca<u>u</u>se of&#160;its high spatial requirement, very few reserves will contain the full home ranges of more than a small number of individuals (Schreiber <em>et al.</em>&#160;1989).<br/><br/>European range states have different monitoring and management regimes varying from strict protection in Finland and Sweden, licensed harvest and control measurements in Norway to legal harvest year-round in Russia.&#160;In North America, Wolverine management issues include regulating trapper harvest, preventing human disturbance at denning sites, and mitigating for habitat loss and fragmentation (Krebs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).<br/><br/>Key conservation measures that need to be implemented revolve around minimising conflicts resulting from depredation of livestock, reducing legal and illegal hunting of Wolverines, establishing well-planned conservation areas and carrying out surveys to gain a better understanding of the&#160;species's&#160;population and ecology. <br/><br/>Farmers and local communities should be educated in and encouraged to adopt husbandry practices that will minimise depredation of livestock thereby reducing conflicts. Economic incentives could encourage farmers to conserve Wolverines on their land instead of hunting them. A compensation and education programme has been implemented in Sweden with Reindeer herders, where the herders profit financially from identifying dens on their land and protecting them; similar programmes could be applied elsewhere&#160;in the species's&#160;range. <br/><br/>Governments and researchers require a more solid knowledge of Wolverine&#160;population dynamics, prey relationships, habitat-use and distribution, to ensure that legal, government-permitted hunting quotas are appropriate and small, localised, endangered populations are protected. Better enforcement of laws that prohibit Wolverine&#160;hunting is required in applicable parts of the species's&#160;range, with higher penalties to discourage poachers. Governments need also improve coordination between wildlife conservation and agriculture programmes to ensure that conservation areas are established in regions with little risk of conflict with farmers and herders.<br/><br/>The Wolverine has been petitioned twice for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act in the conterminous United States, but the most recent petition was denied citing lack of information on distribution, habitat requirements, and threats (United States Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). In North America, the eastern Wolverine population continues to be Endangered, and the western population remains Special Concern. The&#160;species&#160;is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex II* and Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. European range states have different monitoring and management regimes varying from strict protection in Finland and Sweden, licensed harvest and control measurements in Norway to legal harvest year round in Russia.<br/><br/>1. The Scandinavian population is covered by both Swedish and Norwegian management regimes, which are quite different. However, both Norwegian and Swedish populations are monitored through annual counting of active natal dens (Landa <em>et al.</em> 1998) and non-invasive faecal DNA surveys (in southern areas). There is cooperation and data exchange between the two national programmes. The Swedish national interim goal is to reach a minimum of 90 annual Wolverine reproductions (requiring approximately 575 individuals over one year of age) (Riksdagen 2000). Sweden has international obligations through the Bern Convention for the conservation of the European wildlife and habitats, the regulation of trade through the European Council Regulation on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora, and the EU Habitats&#160;Directive. The Wolverine is in Sweden is officially listed as 'endangered' and is not subject to hunting. However, recently a few family groups have been killed in the purpose of reducing conflict with the domestic Reindeer herding industry in northern areas. Norway was recently (2003) divided into&#160;six&#160;different management regions with politically appointed management boards (Miljøverndepartementet 2003). The Norwegian national goal is to control the total population within the limits of 39 yearly active reproductions (21 within the Norwegian part of the Scandinavian Wolverine population) (Miljøverndepartementet 2003). The total of 39 breedings equals approximately 250 individuals &gt;1 yr of age. Control measurements, killing of family groups in early spring and licensed harvest is used as a management tool to restrict Wolverine distribution and predation on unattended sheep during summer and domestic Reindeer all year around. Wolverines in Norway are covered by the Bern Convention (Bern 1979) and as of 2005 were officially listed as 'vulnerable'. <br/><br/>2. The&#160;southern Norwegian population is&#160;subject to the&#160;same measures and legislation as the Norwegian part of the main&#160;Scandinavian population. <br/><br/>3. The Swedish forest population/occurrence is&#160;totally protected; also see description for the Scandinavian population for further details. <br/><br/>4. The Finnish – western Russian population is&#160;subject to different&#160;management between Finland and Russia. In Finland the species is monitored through a national fauna monitoring programme based on tracks crossing fixed 4x4+4 km triangles. Wolverine has&#160;been fully protected in Finland since 1982. In Russia, Wolverine,&#160;a game/pelt species, is monitored via tracking surveys and numbers are estimated based on daily pats and a calculation coefficient (Novikov 1994, 2005).<br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population, which is&#160;small and introduced, seems to function without the presence of semi-domesticated Reindeer, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, or lynx <em>Lynx</em>. Across the country the&#160;species has been&#160;fully protected since 1982.&#160;A research project comparing nutritional ecology of Wolverines within the three national areas of the&#160;species's&#160;distribution has been initiated. A future aim is to develop non-invasive molecular genetic monitoring of&#160;Finland&#160;Wolverines, similar to that conducted in Scandinavia (Kojola 2005).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It ""plays a key role as a relatively long-distance seed disperser for major component species with large and flesh-rich fruits in the subalpine scrubland"" (Otani 2002). It forages on a wide variety of fruits (Otani 2002) but is presumably predominantly carnivorous.&#160;Tatara (1994) used radio-telemetry to investigate&#160;Japanese Marten&#160;habitat selection, and showed that <em>M. m. t</em><em>s</em><em>uensis</em> preferred to forage and rest in deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved forests, and avoided coniferous plantations and open fields. For <em>M. m. tsuensis</em> forest edge was categorised as the most critical factor affecting home range size in relation to food and resting site availability. The race&#160;<em>M. m. melampus</em>&#160;was&#160;camera-trapped in the Akaya area&#160;at elevations ranging from 609-1,687 m asl, indicating no affect of elevation (Hoshino <em>et al</em>. 2013). On Japan the&#160;species&#160;prefers broadleaved forest as its primary habitat, suggesting that it relies&#160;on the complexity of the forest structure for cover and fruiting trees. Tatara (1994) found that on Tsushima martens avoided areas with young trees and trees of low stature and preferred areas with mature and taller trees.",The habitats of this species in Tsushima were degraded by timber cutting (Tatara 1994). Invasive species may also pose a threat.,"Japanese Marten is common throughout its known Japanese range, and is increasing on Tsushima Island. Its status in Korea remains enigmatic.",Stable,"Two subspecies of Japanese Marten have been described: <em>M. m. melampus</em> of Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and adjacent islands, and <em>M. m. tsuensis</em> of the Tsushima islands, which lie between Kyushu and the Korean Peninsula (Masuda 2009). It has been introduced on Sado Island and Hokkaido (Masuda&#160;2009). It has been recorded in the southern Korean Peninsula but there are no locality details to prove a wild origin and no native population has been confirmed (Won and&#160;Smith 1999, Abe 2005).

45214384,41658,Mustela putorius,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Western Polecat is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining at the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category or even as&#160;Near Threatened. The confidence of this assessment is low, given the paucity of recent precise and accurate information on population trend across most of&#160;its range. The geographic range and population (not known, but as&#160;inferred under a reasonable population density)&#160;are both well in excess of&#160;what would be required for the&#160;species to be listed as even Near Threatened on those grounds. However, the&#160;situation is less clear with population trend. As a&#160;species&#160;living largely in landscapes dominated by&#160;farming and other human endeavour, it is difficult to infer population trend from gross patterns of&#160;habitat change; changes&#160;in farming&#160;style&#160;and other human activities are likely to have much larger effects.&#160;There is&#160;evidence of recent strong decline in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany (A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015) and of decline in&#160;various other parts of western Europe&#160;(see 'Population'&#160;section) and it&#160;seems&#160;likely that the&#160;species is declining&#160;across much of this region. However, in&#160;some areas,&#160;such as&#160;Britain and&#160;Switzerland, populations which had&#160;shown heavy declines in the past are now rebounding.&#160;Europe west of the former 'Iron Curtain' accounts&#160;for only about a quarter of Western Polecat range, and in the remaining three-quarters the general opinion is of population&#160;stability. Moreover, population densities in this&#160;latter area are believed to be&#160;substantially higher than in Western Europe.&#160;If all this information is accurate,&#160;the overall global population trend&#160;seems unlikely to reach the rate of about 20% decline per 13-14 years (three generations) that would make a Near Threatened categorisation appropriate, despite the drastic&#160;situation in parts of western Europe.<br/><br/>The North African populations of disputed origin and taxonomic identity, either part of or close to this species, are poorly known but seem to be extremely rare and threatened (Gippoliti 2011, Ahmim 2013,&#160;Griffiths and Cuzin 2013); however, they comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they do not affect the Red List categorisation for the species as a whole.","Over its wide geographic range,&#160;Western&#160;Polecat is found in a wide variety of habitats (Zabala <em>et al</em>. 2005 and references therein). It occurs widely&#160;in lowland woods and in riparian zones, and in rural areas close to farms and villages in the winter; but it also uses wooded steppe, sand dunes, marshes and river valleys, agricultural land, forest edge and mosaic habitats (Birks 1999, Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). In&#160;the&#160;Russian&#160;Federation, which comprises&#160;the majority of its global range, waterside habitats are very important for the&#160;species&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;In Spain, it lives&#160;in a very wide range of environments, from Atlantic to Mediterranean habitats (Virgós&#160;2007,&#160;J. Herrero <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015) with again an association with water-edge habitats&#160;(Zabala&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). In general, mountainous areas are avoided. In the French Mediterranean region in particular, Polecat records&#160;are much less frequent than elsewhere in the country; the&#160;species' presence in this region&#160;seems linked to the presence of wetlands (S. Ruette and M. Guinot-Ghestem <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015), as has been&#160;found in&#160;Italy and Portugal (Rondinini <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mestre <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>It feeds on live lagomorphs,&#160;rodents (various genera of voles, mice and hamsters), amphibians&#160;and other vertebrates, also sometimes on invertebrates and carrion (e.g. Birks 1999). In many Mediterranean areas, it is specialised in the predation of lagomorphs, notably&#160;European&#160;Rabbit&#160;<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>&#160;(Roger 1991, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Population declines in western Europe have generally been attributed to over-hunting and to heavy loss or modification of the species' preferential habitats of wetlands and hedged farmland (e.g. Roger <em>et al</em>. 1988, Birks &amp; Kitchener 1999, Baghli and Verhagen 2003). Hunting is now likely to be less of a problem than formerly except at a local&#160;scale, whereas agrochmicals and introduced carnivores may be widespread and increasing threats (see below).<br/><br/>Wetland&#160;destruction has been identified as&#160;a cause of decline in&#160;Germany and&#160;Switzerland&#160;(A. Schreiber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015,&#160;P. Dollinger<em> pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;In areas where the Polecat is associated with wetlands, reduction of these habitats is particularly damaging in autumn and winter, during periods of lower abundance of amphibians (Weber 1989, Lodé 1991, Baghli <em>et al</em>. 2002). In France, the drying of wetlands and the increase of agricultural land more than halved the total wetland area between 1940 and 1990 (Report Claude Bernard 1994).&#160;Hedges provide adequate cover for Polecat activity in otherwise open farmland&#160;(Birks 2000). Consequently, the wide destruction of hedgerows that occurred in western Europe in the mid and late 20th century&#160;is likely to have&#160;contributed to the decline of the species. Indeed, despite a slowdown in the uprooting of hedgerows since the 1990s, hedgerow surface area declined by 5% per year in France from 1982 to 1990 (Pointereau 2002).<br/><br/>Reduced prey-base also causes&#160;some&#160;declines, particularly in Mediterranean areas where European&#160;Rabbit <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> forms a large part of the diet (see 'Habitats and ecology' section). Mediterranean Rabbit populations have been in steep decline for 25 years because of diseases, such as myxomatosis (Calvete <em>et al</em>. 1997) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) (Moreno&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Delibes-Mateos <em>et al</em>. 2009), and modification of its habitat and hunting (Calvete <em>et al</em>. 2006). The&#160;steep&#160;declines&#160;in Switzerland up to the 1970s were attributed in part to declining populations of&#160;amphibians (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Declines in other prey species, such as European Hamster&#160;<em>Cricetus cricetus</em>&#160;and even rats and mice (Muridae)&#160;probably contribute to the&#160;steep&#160;declines in parts of the range&#160;such as&#160;Saxony-Anhalt, Germany&#160;(A. Weber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Such declines&#160;are driven by intensive agriculture (high pesticide use, rapid cultivation, choice of crops and the near-complete use of land.<br/><br/>Western&#160;Polecat is vulnerable to heavy trapping. It disappeared from most of Britain because of sustained intensive trapping, as a pest of game-birds and small livestock, from the 19th century into the early decades of the 20th (Langley and Yalden 1977). However, it recolonised the country following the near-cessation of this practice (Birks and Kitchener 1999, Birks 2000) and the resurgence of Rabbit populations (Birks 2000).<br/><br/>In western Europe,&#160;Western&#160;Polecat was formerly widely hunted for sport and fur and persecuted as a pest, but these threats have become less serious. The species is now protected in a number of range states and in such areas, the rates of hunting have greatly reduced. For example, in Switzerland, in each of the years 2009, 2013 and 2014 only a&#160;single individual (male) was killed under special license. Cantons issuing the licenses were Zurich, Berne and Argovia (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm. </em>2016). In&#160;such areas, legal killing cannot be a threat. In France, Western Polecat&#160;was classified as 'pest' in half of (49) French departments in 1997, 1999 and 2001. But&#160;trapping of Polecats has progressively&#160;decreased since 1998, and has not been permitted since 2012 (Albaret <em>et al</em>. 2014), except in two areas (totalling around 3,500 km²). However, even before the ban, trapping&#160;intensity seemed limited: in 1998, catches were performed in only 8.6% (± 14%) of localities where the species could legally be trapped (Ruette&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004), and only around 6,000 catches by trapping were registered in France in 2011 (Albaret &#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). August 2012&#160;modification of the French legislation about 'pest' species meant that the Polecat could not be trapped until July 2015; subsequent legislation (July 2015 to July 2018) does not permit trapping of Polecats except in two areas. However,&#160;legal trapping for other mustelid species and non-selective predator control (see Treves and Naughton-Treves, 2005) could represent a threat for the Polecat (S. Ruette and M. Guinot-Ghestem <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In particular, trapping campaigns against the American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;have resulted in many&#160;Polecats being killed in confusion (C. Arthur<em> pers. comm.</em> 2016). Hunting Western Polecat with guns remains legally permitted in France.&#160;The 2013 national enquiry estimated that fewer than 3,000 Polecats were hunted in 2013 in France (ONCFS-FNC in press).<br/><br/>Hunting, as a perceived&#160;pest of wild game, is legal throughout the year in Austria (A. Kranz <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>By contrast with much of western Europe, in European Russia the species is still hunted. However, intentional hunting is not intensive because the price per pelt is so cheap: only 30–50%&#160;of that of American Mink and 10–20%&#160;that of martens <em>Marte</em><em>s</em>. In the area of best habitat for the&#160;species in Russia, the&#160;southern forest expanses in the European part, the polecat is hunted intentionally only occasionally, for example as&#160;a pest of domestic animals&#160;such as&#160;chickens (D.&#160;Skumatov <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). Harvest usually occurs&#160;as a 'by-catch'of hunting for&#160;American Mink&#160;and Pine Marten <em>Martes martes</em> (A. Vaisman per R. Melisch,&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2016). The species is fairly frequent by-catch in traps&#160;set for&#160;American Mink, but only rarely in the baited leghold traps&#160;set for&#160;martens, beavers <em>Ca</em><em>s</em><em>tor</em>, Red Fox&#160;<em>Vulpe</em><em>s v</em><em>ulpe</em><em>s</em>, badgers <em>Mele</em><em>s</em>, Musk Rat&#160;<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>, Eurasian Lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em> and others&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2015). In one area, the trapping of 4,000 Pine Martens resulted in only about 100 Western Polecats taken as bycatch (A. Saveljev pers. comm. 2016).&#160;Overall, trapping is not a threat to the&#160;species in Russia (A. Saveljev <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;In Morocco and Algeria,&#160;in at least some areas, the species is captured for hunting (e.g. Ahmim 2013).<br/><br/>In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, Polecats have a very high pollutant burden (PCB, PBB, PBDE, OCP and human medicine) leading to diminished reproductive output (which is particularly problematic for 'r-strategy' species such as this) (A. Weber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). There is too little comparable information from other parts of the&#160;species's range, but there is no reason not to think that similar pollutant loads will not be borne by populations elsewhere in lowland mesic&#160;western and central Europe, given patterns of human&#160;settlement and agriculture. Frogs&#160;sampled in Switzerland in the 1980s had high levels&#160;of PCBs and these pollutants were considered to have led to major declines in the country's&#160;Eurasian Otter <em>Lutra lutra</em> populations (Weber 1990);&#160;subsequently otter populations have strengthened in the country (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016); Polecat numbers have risen at the&#160;same time although the cause&#160;is not known.&#160;Secondary rodenticide poisoning (see&#160;Shore&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, 1999, 2003; Birks 1998; Fournier-Chambrillon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004; Giraudoux 2006) could potentially be an important threat, but its impact on Polecat populations remains to be evaluated extensively.<br/><br/>The introduced American Mink is likely to be a problematic, at&#160;some level,&#160;for&#160;the Polecat&#160;in the large parts of its&#160;range where this invasive species is now established. The long-term population-level consequences on the Polecat of the variety of&#160;effects of this&#160;species&#160;(see, e.g.&#160;Barrientos 2015) remain poorly understood. Three carnivore species&#160;are believed to be driving Polecat declines in Belarus: the introduced American Mink in valley ecosystems (competition for prey during raising kits, especially the decline in Water Voles <em>Arvicola amphibius</em>&#160;effected by American Mink, and interference towards vulnerable female Polecats); the introduced&#160;Raccoon Dog<em> Nyctereutes procyonoides</em>,&#160;mainly&#160;in forest–swamp mosaics&#160;(competition for carrion in late winter); and the Beech Marten&#160;<em>Martes foina</em>&#160;(interference in human settlements and their surroundings) (Sidorovich 2011, V.E. Sidorovich <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em> 2016). In Latvia the species is possibly being displaced from some areas around human settlement by Beech Marten&#160;(J. Ozolins <em>pers. comm. </em>2015).<br/><br/>The extent to which hybridisation threatens populations is unclear. Hybridisation&#160;with wild-living Domestic Ferrets&#160;<em>Mustela furo</em>&#160;occurs&#160;in the United Kingdom (Costa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013) but it&#160;seems unlikely that on the mainland populations will in the long-term depart phenotypically from wild-type Polecats. In Britain feral Ferrets generally only thrive on islands and appear to be unable to withstand competition from&#160;<em>M. putorius</em>&#160;(A. Kitchener <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em> 2015). In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, introgression with Domestic Ferret was found in 6% of 34 individuals tested genetically, and in 10% of 104 checked morphologically (for skull constriction) (A. Weber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;Overall,&#160;the zone of sympatry between&#160;Western Polecat&#160;and&#160;Steppe Polecat&#160;<em>M. eversmanii</em> includes 43% of the former's&#160;distribution area and 20% of the latter's (Ternovski and Ternovskaya 1994). Wild-taken hybrids are held in museums of&#160;Ukraine, Belarus, and also in the Rostov-on-Don and Orel cities (Russia) (Ternivski and Ternovskaya 1994). The&#160;sympatry is not the result of recent range expansion,&#160;suggesting that&#160;such hybridisation is unlikely to be a threat to the&#160;species. Hybridisation also occurs with European Mink <em>M. lutreola</em>, but again this&#160;seems unlikely to be a threat to this&#160;species.<br/><br/>Mustelids are described as vulnerable to accidental mortality from road&#160;traffic (Birks 1993) and the widespread&#160;steep&#160;increase of road traffic in western Europe and increasingly elsewhere in the&#160;species' range might have population-level effects in areas of high&#160;road density. Moreover, the presence of Polecat prey on and near road-verges may also increase its traffic collision mortality of the predator (Birks 1993, Barrientos and Bolonio 2008).","In general the&#160;Western&#160;Polecat&#160;population is believed to be large and relatively stable in the eastern half to three-quarters&#160;of its range. Considerations&#160;of population trend must take into account that it loses&#160;more than half its population from autumn to spring annually (D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2016). It is common in forested areas of European Russia, where the population&#160;density&#160;is&#160;about one individual per km² in winter in the southern taiga zone from the Belarus border in the west to Izhevsk city in the east (D. Skumatov <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). There is no precise&#160;information on population trend in the country. It is not a focus&#160;of the state hunting monitoring;&#160;information is collected only incidentally to the main species for monitoring and the hunting bag is not recorded&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). However,&#160;over its large range in the&#160;Russian&#160;Federation, which comprises a large proportion of the&#160;species' entire global range,&#160;annual official monitoring of wildlife by&#160;snow-tracking&#160;suggests&#160;that it is&#160;relatively&#160;stable, perhaps with&#160;some decline (but much less than 20%)&#160;since 2000&#160;(A. Saveljev <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015, D.&#160;Skumatov <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;Based on hunters' opinions, the population is&#160;stable or&#160;increasing in Estonia&#160;(T. Maran <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;In Latvia the population is widespread and healthy, although the species is possibly being displaced from some areas around human settlement by Beech Marten&#160;<em>Martes foina</em>&#160;(J. Ozolins <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). By contrast, in Belarus, the&#160;species is believed to be in decline, and recent&#160;surveys in&#160;Naliboki Forest and its rural surroundings found only 4.7-8.3 individuals per 100 km² (Sidorovich 2011,&#160;V.E.&#160;Sidorovich <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Similarly,&#160;further&#160;south,&#160;in Romania, 2007/2008&#160;–&#160;2011/2012 hunting bag statistics and 2005–2013 population estimates (source: Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, www.mmediu.ro, accessed on 12 October 2014), for which there is no previous comparison period,&#160;converge in suggesting a 22–25% decline during the 14 years to 2013; notably, the hunting quota did not decline during&#160;2007/2008&#160;–&#160;2011/2012,&#160;so the drop in number taken was not driven by a change in regulation (A.D. Sandor <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Although the Polecat is considered by the public (game-keepers, scientists and lay public) to be the most common mustelid in Romania, a 2012–2014 transect survey for tracks&#160;focused on the centre and west of the country recorded it in only 54.25% of transects comprising apparently&#160;suitable habitat (compared with 65.57% for Pine Marten <em>Martes martes</em>, 76.12% for Wild Cat <em>Felis sylvestris</em> and 91.50% for Eurasian Otter <em>Lutra lutra</em>)&#160;(A.D.&#160;Sandor<em> pers. comm.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Western Europe, the species is scarce, typically occurring at densities of about 1 individual per 10 km², and rarely exceeding 5–10 individuals per 10 km², even in optimal habitat.&#160;In the United Kingdom numbers are now increasing, following a major persecution-driven decline from the 1800s to 1920s (Davison <em>et al</em>. 1999), although there is a significant degree of introgression with Domestic Ferret&#160;<em>M. furo</em> (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013). In France the&#160;species' conservation status was&#160;assessed&#160;in 2007 (2002–2006) and in 2013 (2007–2012): it was 'Unfavourable – Inadequate' in 2013 versus 'Unknown' in 2007 in two biogeographic regions (Alpine and Mediterranean), but the improvement of knowledge allowed assessment as 'Favourable' in the two other regions (Atlantic and Continental). Its&#160;range dropped from 11,263 to 3,300 km² in the Alpine region and from 37,199 to 15,600 km² in the Mediterranean region between 2007 and 2013; the total French distribution area was 465,680 km² in 2007 but only 334,300 in 2013&#160;(Bensettiti and Puissauve 2015). A modelling approach intending to account for the search effort predicted a probable decrease in&#160;Polecat numbers&#160;in 30% of the French agricultural regions whereas an increase was probable in 20% of them&#160;(Calenge <em>et al</em>. 2016, in press). The southern French population has presumably&#160;decreased in line with this range contraction although&#160;no precise number exist. In Switzerland, a massive decline took place until the late 1970s but since then the population has stabilised and even, locally (in the Grisons) increased (Hausser 1995, Anderegg 2004); road-kill&#160;statistics&#160;show a huge,&#160;sustained&#160;increase in reported Polecats between 2009 and 2014 (from 2 to 153), an increase mirrored in&#160;such observation of&#160;few other&#160;species, and thus more likely to reflect an increasing Polecat population than changed reporting behaviour (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Spain it&#160;seems to live at generally low densities&#160;(J. Herrero <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;Widespread declines are believed to be occurring in the Mediterranean climatic zones&#160;of&#160;Spain and Portugal, probably associated with use of pesticides but also reflecting the reduction of the European Rabbit&#160;<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus&#160;</em>population, but no quantitative data exist (E.J. Virgós <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015;&#160;I. Zuberogoitia <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015); the&#160;species is very much in the 'attention-shadow' of the larger carnivores. Intensive control programmes&#160;for American Mink&#160;<em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;in northern&#160;Spain reveal that the Polecat is now very&#160;scarce there&#160;(I. Zuberogoitia <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Austria, the hunting bag of polecats (Western and Steppe combined, the vast majority being the former) increased from 6,000 in 1955 to almost 14,000 in 1968 and then decreased back to 6,000 in 2003 (Reimoser <em>et al</em>. 2006). Official hunting bag&#160;statistics for 1983–2014 (provided by STATcube [Statistische Datenbank von Statistik Austria] per&#160;A Kranz <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016)&#160;show&#160;strong indication of periodical cycling (approximately 10 years between peaks, with troughs about three-quarters of the preceding peaks)&#160;but an obvious&#160;general downward trend resulting in an approximate halving of the hunting bag in the 31-year period. These data are consistent with ongoing&#160;population decline, but the role of variation in hunting effort is&#160;difficult to untangle, although at least the cycling&#160;seems more likely to reflect Polecat population than hunter behaviour. If&#160;so, this urges particular care when looking at trends in population (or in surrogates&#160;such as road-kills or hunting bags)&#160;derived from only a few years' data.<br/><br/>No monitoring or survey have been performed in Italy. The only data on this species's&#160;status&#160;come from road casualties, but these&#160;are not systematically collated. The present&#160;conservation status in Italy is thus&#160;considered unknown by the National Institute for Nature Protection (ISPRA)&#160;(M. Pavanello <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Germany, there is widespread&#160;opinion of decline, originally noted through decreasing hunting bags (A. Schreiber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In Saxony, there was&#160;a&#160;steep decrease during the late twentieth century (H. Ansorge&#160;<em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015). The most detailed information comes from Saxony-Anhalt: between 1962–1989 and 2005–2014, the range in this state (total land area: 20,452 km²) dropped by 10,120 km²; and the number of Polecats found victim to road or rail accidents approximately halved between 2006–2007 and 2012, without the implementation of any polecat-specific&#160;protection measures on roads or railways, suggesting that the change reflects the local Polecat population density (A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;It is impossible to judge how representative these alarming results are for a wider area, because of the lack comparable case studies from elsewhere. Comparable declines are&#160;strongly&#160;suspected&#160;in at least three other federal states of Germany (Mecklenburg&#160;–&#160;Western Pomerania, Brandenburg and Thuringia; more or less all eastern federal states with equal agricultural methods)&#160;(A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015). Moreover, there is nothing obviously unique about the general situation of agriculture and other human factors in these&#160;states of Germany, making it quite plausible that the situation is similar across much of&#160;Central Europe's agricultural landscape.<br/><br/>The status of the North African populations part of, or allied to, this species is poorly known; the species&#160;may now be very rare (Gippoliti 2011, Ahmim 2013,&#160;Griffiths and Cuzin 2013).",Decreasing,"Western&#160;Polecat is widespread in the western Palaearctic east to the Ural Mountains in the Russian Federation; it is absent from Ireland, northern Scandinavia, much of the Balkans, much of the eastern Adriatic coast, and occurs in&#160;Greece&#160;only marginally, in the north. It is widespread in France, less&#160;so in the&#160;south-west and&#160;south-east&#160;(Berzins and Ruette 2014, Calenge <em>et al</em>. 2015), in mainland Spain (Grupo de carnívoros terrestres de la SECEM 2001,&#160;Virgós&#160;2007), in Romania (A.D.&#160;Sandor <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015) and in many other countries of its range.&#160;Since the year 2000 many distribution gaps in the Swiss Midlands and Jura have been filled and in the Grisons the species has expanded its range in the Vorderrhein Valley to almost the Oberalp Pass, and in the Vorderrhein Valley to the Via Mala area (Infofauna 2016).<br/><br/>There is&#160;some evidence of northern range expansion recently (references cited in&#160;Zabala&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, T. Maran <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;The north-eastern border of regular occurrence runs approximately to Arkhangelsk city, Syktyvkar city and Perm city (Russia); north and east of this&#160;line, it&#160;is very rare, being replaced over the River Kama by its ecological analogue, Siberian Weasel&#160;<em>M. sibirica</em>;&#160;wild hybrids between the two, from west of the Kama, are known (D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2015). It has recently been recorded at Cherdyn' (Perm province) at about 60°30'N, 57°E (S. Glebov per D. Skumatov <em>pers. comm. </em>2016). Western&#160;Polecat&#160;inhabits&#160;the west slope of the Middle and South Urals; recent occurrence east of the Urals&#160;(up to Kurgan city) is possible, but not proven. The species&#160;inhabits the&#160;forest-steppe zone from the&#160;southern Urals&#160;to the River Volga, River Don and the Azov Sea. To the&#160;south occurs&#160;Steppe&#160;Polecat&#160;<em>M. eversmanii</em>; hybridisation occurs&#160;(Ternovski and Ternovskaya 1994).<br/><br/>Populations of disputed taxonomic identity that are either part of, or close to, this species are found in North Africa, in the Moroccan Rif Mountains (Griffiths and Cuzin 2013) and in adjacent Algeria (Ahmim 2013). The feral range of the Domestic Ferret <em>Mustela furo</em>&#160;includes&#160;some&#160;areas within&#160;Western&#160;Polecat's native range (e.g. Britain) and some outside it such as New Zealand (Clapperton 2001).<br/><br/>In Europe,&#160;Western&#160;Polecat&#160;has been recorded from&#160;sea-level&#160;up to at least 1,600 m a.s.l. in&#160;Spain&#160;(Virgós&#160;2007) and&#160;up to 1,400 m for the French Pyrenees (C. Arthur <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016) and 1,500 m for the French Alps (P. Rigaux <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016); previous&#160;statements of occurrence up to 2,000 m a.s.l. in France remain to be corroborated, although in&#160;Switzerland&#160;there are recent records&#160;at altitudes&#160;probably above 1900 a.s.l. (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016). The African populations occur from&#160;sea level to 2,400 m (Griffiths and Cuzin 2013).","Western&#160;Polecat is legally hunted in&#160;the&#160;Russian&#160;Federation&#160;and in various other countries&#160;for its fur. Because of the high variety of shades of hairs and their gradations it is difficult to find two or three hides of the same coloration, and it is impossible to find thirty or fifty similar hides for a jacket – hence Western Polecat furs harvested from the wild can be found on the Russian domestic market only in the form of smaller handicraft products&#160;such as&#160;hats and caps (N. Dronova and A. Vaisman per R. Melisch <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016). Industrial production use farmed hides from hybrid forms. According to Sergey Stolbov, President of the Russian Fur Union (A. Vaisman&#160;per R. Melisch <em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2016), Western Polecat, as the&#160;species is treated by the Red List&#160;(pure-bred offspring of individuals taken from the wild), has never been farmed for hide production. Hybrids with Domestic Ferret&#160;(i.e. <em>M. putoris</em> ×&#160;<em>M. (putoris) furo</em>) are, however, farmed in Russia at two fur farms (one in Pushkino close to Moscow, one in Tver province) in industrial volumes, producing about 30,000-35,000 hides per year. These are&#160;all solely for the Russian domestic market and there are multiple regularly breeding coloured forms of furs: pearl, golden, snowy-white, coal-black, etc. Statements that&#160;the species is&#160;farmed for fur in the Russian Far East (e.g. Dronova and Shestakov 2005), many thousand kilometres from its natural range, are likely also to refer to the said hybrid form.<br/><br/>The EU-TWIX database and mailing list exchanges which concentrate on information on seized specimen of fauna and flora from the wild hold, as of February 2016, no information relating to this species. (http://www.eutwix.org/ ; http://www.traffic.org/home/2015/12/3/eu-twix-ten-years-of-enforcement-assistance.html; V. Sacré &#160;per&#160;R. Melisch&#160;<em>pers. comm. </em>2016). There is also no seizure information held in China on the&#160;species&#160;(Xiao Yu per&#160;R. Melisch&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).",Terrestrial,"Given the widespread&#160;opinion and localised evidence&#160;of recent steep declines in continental western Europe, the most important conservation&#160;requirement is for research to clarify the range of threats, and, for each, the intensity and geographic&#160;spread, to allow the design and implementation of effective conservation measures where they are needed. In particular, it is urgent to undertake, across Europe,&#160;research comparable to that&#160;in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, which has indicated&#160;recent steep declines there (A. Weber <em>pers.&#160;comm.</em>&#160;2015;&#160;see 'Population'&#160;section).<br/><br/>Western&#160;Polecat is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and Annex V of the EU Council’s Directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (EU Habitats Directive). It is protected in Italy (M. Pavanello <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016) and under Schedule 6 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (UK) and&#160;by the regional Red Data Book on southern border of its Russian&#160;area, in Rostovskaya oblast’ (Rostov-na-Donu city)&#160;(D.&#160;Skumatov&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In Spain, it is listed in the national&#160;Red Data Book&#160;as Near Threatened (Virgós&#160;2007). In Switzerland it was categorised as Vulnerable in 1994; it will&#160;shortly be reassessed (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;The species was&#160;included in the 'pre-warning list' (analogous&#160;to Near Threatened) for Germany in 1998 and was&#160;kept therein in the new edition of the German Red List in 2009. This status is a compromise between the various red lists of the many German Bundesländer (provinces), some of which classify the polecat in higher threat categories, while there could still be provinces where the polecat is not included yet at all&#160;(A. Schreiber <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;It is registered in Annex V to DHFF (Directive Habitats-Faune-Flore), France, and therefore benefited from an assessment of its conservation status in 2007 (2002–2006) and in 2013 (2007–2012) (Bensettiti and Puissauve 2015). It receives at least some level of protection in many other range&#160;states. In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, where&#160;steep declines have recently been demonstrated,&#160;hunting is prohibited for the period 2015-2019 (with possibility of extension) to preserve Polecat numbers. This has prompted intensive&#160;study of&#160;occurrence, population dynamics, genetic monitoring, and survey of carcases&#160;(A. Weber<em> pers. comm.</em> 2016).&#160;It occurs in many protected areas across its range.<br/><br/>The decline in Switzerland up to the 1970s was combated by the improvement of habitat by creation of new ponds for amphibians and revitalisation of small rivers (P. Dollinger <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). In much of continental western Europe it is very important to widen and restore river-banks and wetlands and to accept Eurasian Beaver <em>Castor fiber&#160;</em>as a promotor of natural habitat development. It is similarly important to restore the edges of woods and hedges and to minimise mowing of fallow agricultural land and of field boundaries. Restocking operations are trying to rebuild some Rabbit populations, particularly in the Mediterranean region (Letty&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006), but methods need to be improved (Calvete&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, Moreno&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). These transactions may prove beneficial in maintaining the Polecat (Birks 2000). Conservation of&#160;Eurasian Hamster <em>Cricetus cricetus</em> is beneficial to the Polecat and warrants wider implementation.<br/><br/>Where either occurs, control of American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;and Raccoon Dog <em>Nyctereutes procyonoides</em>&#160;important to prevent declines of Western Polecat.&#160;Reduced release of Domestic Ferrets <em>Mustela furo&#160;</em>into the wild would reduce the (apparently rather low) threat from introgression.<br/><br/>The taxonomic and conservation status of the North African populations part of, or allied to, this species is poorly known. They may now be very rare, an issue of concern if they are an autochthonous, potentially somewhat taxonomically distinct, form (Gippoliti 2011, Ahmim 2013,&#160;Griffiths and Cuzin 2013).

45216638,41686,Procyon lotor,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern because it is broadly distributed across&#160;North and Central America in a variety of habitats, is&#160;fairly common, and is&#160;present in many protected areas. It is not undergoing any significant decline and is adaptable to human conversion of habitat - thus its population may be increasing in some areas.","This species is very adaptable and is found almost anywhere water is available, along streams and shorelines. Dens under logs or rock, in tree hole, ground burrow, or in bank den (Armstrong 1975). In some areas it has adapted to city life and is commensal with the human population. However, raccoons are most abundant in hardwood swamps, mangroves, flood forests, and marshes. Average home range is 90-150 acres (Baker 1983). Population density was reported as one individual per 10-16 acres by Baker (1983). Typically solitary except female with young. This&#160;raccoon is nocturnal, foraging either singly or in groups. It is an opportunistic omnivore, eating fruits, nuts, insects, small mammals, birds'&#160;eggs and nestlings, reptile eggs, frogs, fishes, aquatic invertebrates, worms, and garbage. It obtains most food on or near ground near water.","Few major threats exist to the species as a whole. Regional potential threats do exist, however, and include hunting, trapping and poisoning. Commonly hunted for sport and trapped for pelt (made into coats, collars, muffs, and trimmings). It is also one of the more common victims of road kill, especially about suburban areas and water bodies.",The Northern Raccoon is generally quite common and very adaptable to the human environment and populations are likely to be increasing in size in suburban areas (Gehrt 2004).,Increasing,"Originally a North and Central American species, occurring from the Canadian prairies southwards across the United States of America (except for parts of the Rocky Mountains and the deserts) through all Central America down to northern Panama (Helgen and Wilson 2003, 2005).

More recent craniometric evidence suggests is also present in Colombia (Marín <em>et al</em>. 2012), but there has been&#160;no comparison directly with North American individuals,&#160; so some&#160; uncertainty persists (González-Maya <em>et al</em>. 2011). Introductions since the 1930s of animals into Germany, the Russian Federation, and many subsequent escapes by farmed animals in various parts of&#160;Europe, have resulted in expanding European and Central Asian populations of this species (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Winter 2006, Beltrán-Beck&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;García <em>et al</em>. 2012, M.

45813880,4185,Ceratotherium simum,Near Threatened,,2020,2020-01-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The reason for assessing this species as Near Threatened and not Least Concern continues to be the continued and high poaching threat and illegal demand for horn in SE Asia (especially Viet Nam and China), increased involvement of organised international criminal syndicates in rhino poaching (see Emslie <em>et al.</em> (2019)&#160;<a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>&#160;for further details). Protection efforts depend on significant Range State expenditure and effort, and if these were to decline rampant poaching could seriously threaten numbers (well in excess of 30% over three generations). Declining state budgets for conservation in real terms, declining capacity in some areas and increasing arrests of Southeast Asians for rhino crimes in African Range States are all of concern. Estimated White Rhino numbers have declined 15% from 2012–17 in response to increased poaching. This decline has largely been because of a major decline in the largest subpopulation in Greater Kruger due to poaching. While absolute numbers poached in this park continue to decline, so have White Rhino numbers with the result that in relative terms poaching has remained at unsustainable levels. Fortunately, White Rhino numbers have been increasing in many other populations and since White Rhino poaching peaked in 2014 it has declined in response to considerably increased law enforcement and protection efforts. Reported poaching in the major Range State South Africa is also down in 2019. While the White Rhino is close to having less than 10,000 mature individuals, it would not meet any other of the additional criteria under C1 or C2.<br/><br/><strong>In summary the rationale for treating White Rhino as Near Threatened and not Least Concern is that in the&#160;</strong><strong>numbers could decline significantly in the&#160;</strong><strong>absence of, or significant reduction of current conservation measures.&#160;</strong><strong>Despite White Rhino point estimates declining by an estimated 15% from 2012–17, numbers are&#160;</strong><strong>nowhere near reaching critical thresholds under criteria A2 or A4 (see Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 4 and 5 in the attached S</strong><strong>upplementary Information document). Recorded White Rhino poaching has been declining since 2014.</strong></p>",The species is found in grassland in bushveld savanna habitats. It is a grazer.,"<p>The main threat to the population is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. Until recently, at the continental species level, poaching of White Rhinos has not had a serious impact on overall numbers of White Rhinos in Africa, with poaching losses in parts of the range being surpassed by encouraging growth rates in others. However following declines in the largest subpopulation (Greater Kruger) continental numbers declined by an estimated 15% from 2012 to 2015. While poaching levels increased dramatically from 2007 to 2014, numbers of White Rhinos reported poached have declined in each of the four years every year since, and half year reported poaching in 2019 in the major Range State, South Africa indicates this trend is possibly continuing. See attached Supplementary Material for graphs of reported poaching numbers by year.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in declining live sale prices and reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales at lower prices). However, so far there appears to be a consolidation of White Rhino into larger subpopulations. For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).<br/><br/>Poaching and civil wars in both Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring South Sudan had a devastating impact on Northern White Rhino. Whilst poaching pressure initially increased during civil unrest and war in the late 1990s, good reproduction enabled the population to remain relatively stable. However, since 2003, poaching escalated and the population declined rapidly with 11 carcasses found in a three-month period between March and May 2004. Confirmed numbers of Northern White Rhino fell from 30 individuals in April 2003 to just four in August 2005. No live rhino have been seen since 2006 or signs of live rhino (spoor or dung) reported since 2007 despite intensive systematic foot surveys. It is believed that the Northern White Rhino has probably gone extinct in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rumours persist of possible survivors in war-torn South Sudan, but as yet there has been no conclusive evidence of this being the case.&#160;</p>","<p>As of 31 December 2017, there were an estimated 18,064 White Rhino in the wild. The majority (99.3% ) of White Rhino occur in just five countries (South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Botswana and Zimbabwe (Emslie<em> et al</em>. 2019 <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>). As of Dec 2008 there were an estimated 750 in captivity worldwide.<br/><br/>Once widespread in the bushveld areas of southern Africa south of the Zambezi River, the Southern White Rhino was on the brink of extinction by the end of the 19th century having been reduced to just one small population of approximately 20–50 animals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, by the end of 2012, after years of protection and many translocations, the subspecies had grown to an estimated 21,316 wild animals. Following poaching increases estimated numbers had declined about 15% to 18,064 by the end of 2017 with bootstrapped 90% confidence levels of 17,212 to 18,915. South Africa remains the stronghold for this subspecies (~86.5%) conserving an estimated 18,933 individuals by the end of&#160;2012. Smaller reintroduced subpopulations occur within former Range States in Botswana, Namibia, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe; subpopulations of free-ranging Southern White Rhino have also been established outside their historical range in Kenya, Zambia (Emslie and Brooks 1999) and more recently Uganda although Uganda is a former <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ceratotherium simum cottoni</span>&#160;Range State and an ~3,500 year old White Rhino subfossil indicates at one stage Kenya was also once a White Rhino Range State. Numbers of White Rhino under private ownership continue to increase.<br/><br/>In the only confirmed surviving wild subpopulation in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Northern White Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. s. cottoni</span>) numbers declined rapidly from 30 in April 2003 due to an upsurge in poaching, and surveys in 2006 confirmed the presence of only four rhinos (Emslie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006). Numbers are believed to have stood at around 2,360 in 1960 (Emslie and Brooks 1999). However based largely on extensive and systematic foot surveys which failed to sight live rhino and find any signs (spoor and dung) this subpopulation is now considered probably extinct. Reports of a few possible Northern White Rhino surviving in a remote part of Southern Sudan have yet to be confirmed. The last four potential breeding Northern White Rhino in captivity were moved to a private conservancy in Kenya in the hope that a move to more wild conditions would&#160;stimulate them to breed. While the two females came into oestrus and mated no calves have been born and the two males have subsequently died. Assisted reproductive methods are being developed in the hope of being able to conserve some Northern White Rhino genes.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Two subspecies of White Rhino are currently recognized, the Northern (NWR) and the Southern (SWR), each having a strikingly discontinuous range in recent times. However there is fossil evidence the species used to have a continuous distribution and there is genetic evidence of probable post divergence secondary contact during the last interglacial (14,000 to 26,000 years ago) facilitated by savanna grassland expansion at that time (Moodley <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>The Northern White Rhino (NWR) used to range over parts of northwestern Uganda, southern Chad, southwestern South Sudan, the eastern part of Central African Republic, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sydney 1965). The previous only confirmed population in Garamba National Park in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is now considered probably extinct. Despite systematic ground surveys over probable range and additional foot patrols and aerial reconnaissance no live rhinos have been seen since 2006 and no fresh sign since 2007. There continue to be unconfirmed reports/rumours of rhino in southern Sudan but these have not been reliably confirmed and wildlife poaching in this area has reportedly increased and so it is unlikely any still survive. The last four potential breeding Northern White Rhino in captivity in Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic were translocated to a private conservancy in Kenya in the hope this would stimulate their breeding but despite mating no offspring were produced before the two old males died, and it appears the females will not breed despite attempts at inter-crossing. These two non-breeding females form the only current confirmed living NWR but cannot be included in the Red List assessments as they haven't bred since reintroduction back into the wild.&#160;Any future conservation of adaptive NWR genes now is dependent of successfully developing new assisted reproduction techniques.&#160;Researchers have collected oocytes from the two surviving NWR females and have sperm cells from five NWR that have all since died. The later could be used in IVF efforts. Advanced cellular techniques offer the potential to boost founder genetic diversity as there are stored cells and tissues from a greater number of NWR than for natural gametes. If Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to produce primordial germ cells, then there is a possibility to create oocytes and sperm from other dead NWR. If IVF can be successfully developed with embryos implanted in surrogate SWR mothers, then it should be possible to produce NWR calves. The latter when grown up could be used to create a self-sustaining population of rhinos. IVF inter-crossing could also be attempted. In time if such assisted reproductive methods can be successfully developed then once numbers have built up sufficiently some of these animals could be reintroduced back into secure areas of former range or close to former range in East Africa. There can be no guarantee's such techniques will be successful but at this stage progress has been made in creating embryos in the lab.<br/><br/>The Southern White Rhino was on the brink of extinction by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>&#160;century (<em>c.</em>&#160;1895) having been reduced to just one small population of approximately 20–50 animals in KwaZulu-Natal, after settlers had over-hunted them for sport and to clear land for agriculture throughout almost all of their historical range&#160;(Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, by the end of 2015, after years of protection and many translocations (Emslie and Brooks 1999), the subspecies had grown to ~20,000 animals in the wild and semi-wild (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019) in over 400 subpopulations. The Southern White Rhino is now the most numerous of the rhino taxa, with South Africa remaining the stronghold for this subspecies despite increased poaching.<br/><br/>Southern White Rhino numbers increased rapidly from 1992-2010, averaging +7.1%/year. However population growth then slowed as poaching increased, with numbers declining from 2012 onwards.&#160;The ~15% decline in estimated continental White Rhino numbers from 2012–2017 can largely be accounted for by a drop in estimated numbers in the largest population, in South Africa’s Kruger National Park (KNP), which has been severely affected by poaching since 2007. Despite absolute numbers of White Rhinos being reported poached declining in Kruger over the last four years, so has the number of White Rhino numbers in the park. To a much lesser extent this population (and some others) were also negatively affected by a recent very bad drought. The result is that as a % of the population, poaching in Kruger NP has remained at unsustainably high levels. This is especially the case when one considers evidence that indicates some poached carcasses in this and other very large Parks are not detected (Ferreira <em>et al.</em> 2018; N. Anderson and R. du Toit pers. comm.).&#160;Fortunately some of the Kruger Park decline has been partially cancelled out by increases elsewhere - especially on private land in South Africa as well as in some other Range States. Numbers&#160;on privately-owned wild populations in South Africa that provided estimates for both 2017 and 2018 increased by +6.9% while numbers on the largest semi-wild CBO population also increased by +6.8% over the year. Numbers of White Rhino also increased by 3.1% from 2017–18 in the rest of Africa outside of South Africa (2,442 to 2,517) with just over half of this likely to have been from exports of live animals from South Africa in 2018. 90% Confidence Levels around continental Southern White Rhino estimates (derived by bootstrapping using calculated or estimated precision around estimates) for end 2017 were estimated at 17,212–18,915 (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p>    <p>Sizeable populations occur in the greater Kruger National Park (which incorporates additional private and state reserves) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (the original source of all surviving Southern White Rhino alive today), but also occur in numerous state protected areas and private reserves (some of which are also well protected) throughout the country. Live sales, limited sport hunting and ecotourism have historically provided incentives which has resulted in a significant expansion of range and numbers on private land - especially in the major Range State South Africa. There are now more White Rhino on private land in South Africa than there are rhino in the whole of the rest of Africa. However increased poaching since 2007, resultant significantly increased security costs and reduced and limited economic incentives for their conservation have resulted in significantly reduced demand for White Rhino. Live sale prices of surplus White Rhino have declined significantly (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019) and an increasing number of owners seeking to get rid of their rhino. If it expands to larger populations this trend may threaten the continued expansion of range, and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales). Lower removal rates from established populations will negatively affect metapopulation growth rates in future as well as reduce budgets for conservation. There are smaller reintroduced subpopulations within the historical range of the species in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). The&#160;small number that survived in Mozambique were poached out, but some animals have crossed the border into Mozambique from Kruger Park in South Africa. While they used to have a very limited lifespan if not chased back across the border into South Africa small numbers now survive in some areas due to improved protection.&#160;Populations of Southern White Rhino have also been introduced outside of the known former range of the subspecies to Kenya, Uganda and to Zambia (Emslie and Brooks 1999, Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2007). Uganda was previously a Northern White Rhino range state and so the species has been reintroduced to this country. Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2018) work suggests that some form of White Rhino could have been native to Zambia and Kenya prior to recent historical times.<br/><br/>An estimated four White Rhino still live in the wild two other African countries, but these are remnants of animals introduced well outside the historical range of the species.<br/><br/>While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the last two hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya and northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhino, presumably similar to the northern race (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ceratotherium simum cottoni</span>), was widespread and a part of the East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could easily kill such tame animals (Brett 1993). This is based on the White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year from Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a White Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as a species but not <em>C. s. simum</em> as a subspecies has probably been reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a White Rhino hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be confirmed but merits further investigation.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries, the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons. For this reason, only whole countries of occurrence are indicated on the range maps produced by the AfRSG. However, numbers by species and subspecies are routinely summarised at a continental level. Estimated numbers by country as of the end of 2017 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>) were South Africa 15,625, Namibia 975, Kenya 513 (with 510 <em>C. s. simum</em> and 3 <em>C. s. cottoni</em>), Botswana 452, Zimbabwe 367, Eswatini 66, Mozambique 29, Uganda 22, Zambia 14. There were an additional one and three animals respectively out of range in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal but these are not historical Range States for the species. Bootstrapped estimates of 90% confidence levels around the total point estimate for 2017 were 17,212 to 18,915. Due to incomplete information from three South African provinces at the time of writing it is not possible to provide an updated end 2018 continental estimate. Indications are that South African 2018 numbers are likely to be similar or slightly lower than 2017. End 2018 estimates for other countries were Namibia 1,082, Kenya 664 (622 SWR, 2 NWR), Botswana 401, Zimbabwe 357, Eswatini 79, Mozambique 28, Uganda 25 and Zambia 11. The continued existence of four WR out of range in West Africa is not confirmed.</p>","It has been estimated that around 95% of horn sourced in Africa for illegal markets in Asia in 2016 and 2017 came from poached animals in the wild (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019). In some cases horn for illegal markets has been stolen or illegally sold from horn stockpiles/private trophies/museum exhibits. “Pseudo-hunting” where sport hunting has been undertaken by individuals from non-traditional hunting countries with the aim of illegally providing horn to illegal markets has also been responsible for some of the illegal horn getting onto end-user markets although this has reduced considerably since South Africa implemented a number of measures in 2012. At one stage as much as 18% of the horn sourced for illegal markets came from this source (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2012) but most recent estimates suggest this source only contributes 0.7% (Emslie <em>et al. </em>2019). Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat, but this forms part of routine biological management of the species to meet genetic and demographic goals. This is because many established wild subpopulations require regular removals to prevent “overstocking” and maintain rapid population growth rates. Maintaining rapid underlying population growth rates also minimises loss of genetic diversity over time due to genetic drift. Given the high price of sport-hunting, and clamp down on pseudo-hunting by South Africa in 2012, only about 75 White Rhino are currently sport hunted per year in Africa. This is less than 0.5% of the population annually. For more information see Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>.",Terrestrial,"<p>Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new subpopulations both within and outside the species’ former ranger. However, increasing black market prices for rhino horn, increased poaching of rhino and involvement of criminal syndicates in recent years pose a significant threat to rhino subpopulations. Strategically, White Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long-term security. In Southern Africa live sale of White Rhinos on auction (and limited sport hunting of surplus males) has also created incentives for private sector conservation and generated much needed funds which can help pay the high cost of successfully monitoring, protecting and managing rhino. Almost half of the White Rhino across Africa are now managed by the private sector throughout Africa with the majority in South Africa (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, as discussed above, incentives are declining while protection costs and risks have increased resulting in some owners getting rid of their rhino.<br/><br/>By 1977, all African rhino species were listed on CITES Appendix I, and all international commercial trade in rhinos and their products was prohibited. However, following a continued increase in numbers, the South African population of Southern White Rhino was downlisted in 1994 to Appendix II, but only for trade in live animals to “approved and acceptable destinations” and for the (continued) export of hunting trophies. Numbers have almost trebled since then. In 2004, Eswatini's (formerly Swaziland) Southern White Rhino were also downlisted to CITES Appendix II, but only for live export and for limited export of hunting trophies according to specified annual quotas. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of the major consumer states and law enforcement effort has been stepped up in many consumer countries. Demand reduction initiatives are also underway in key implicated states such as Viet Nam.<br/><br/>In addition to local, national, international and continental initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the South African Development Community (SADC) Rhino Management Group , a recently revitalised East African Rhino Management Group and the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group. IUCN SSC's African Rhino Specialist Group is the continental coordinating body for rhino conservation in Africa. In addition to National Rhino Plans there is a Continental African Rhino Range States Conservation Plan.

The species is widespread and is common in conservation areas, becoming uncommon in arid areas and on farms in South Africa where they are occasionally persecuted. There are no major threats believed to be resulting in any major range-wide declines.","In southern Africa, the prime habitat is mainly short-grass plains and areas with bare ground (Mackie and Nel 1989), but they are also found in open scrub vegetation and arid, semi-arid or winter rainfall (fynbos or Cape macchia) shrub lands, and open arid savanna. The range of both subspecies overlaps almost completely with that of <em>Hodotermes</em> and <em>Microhodotermes</em>, termite genera prevailing in the diet (Mackie and Nel 1989, Maas 1993a). In the Serengeti, they are common in open grassland and woodland boundaries but not short-grass plains (Lamprecht 1979, Malcolm 1986); harvester termite (<em>H. mossambicus</em>) foraging holes and dung from migratory ungulates are more abundant in areas occupied by Bat-eared Foxes, while grass is shorter and individual plants are more widely spaced (Maas 1993a).","There are no major threats, but they are subject to subsistence hunting for skins or because they are perceived as being predators of small livestock.&#160;Populations fluctuate due to disease (especially rabies and canine distemper, which can cause short-term drastic declines in populations) or drought (which depresses insect numbers).","The species is common in conservation areas in southern and eastern Africa, becoming uncommon in arid areas and on farms in South Africa where they are occasionally persecuted. Within a circumscribed habitat, numbers can fluctuate from abundant to rare depending on rainfall, food availability (Waser 1980, Nel <em>et al.</em> 1984), breeding stage and disease (Maas 1993a,b; Nel 1993). Recorded densities include 0.7-14/km²<sup>&#160;</sup>in the Kalahari (Nel <em>et al</em>. 1984) and 0.3-1.0 / km²&#160;in the Serengeti (Hendrichs 1972).",Stable,"The Bat-eared Fox has a disjunct distribution range, occurring across the arid and semi-arid regions of eastern and southern Africa in two discrete populations (representing each of the known subspecies) separated by about 1,000 km.

It is present in a number of&#160;protected areas across its range (see Nel and Maas 2004, 2013). <br/><br/>Bat-eared Foxes are kept in captivity in North America, Europe, South Africa and Asia, although never in large numbers. A Bat-eared Fox European StudBook was established at Banham Zoo in 2011 and an AZA Studbook has been established at Peoria Zoo in Illinois (2012/2013) (M. Woolham pers. comm. 2013). Importations have occurred throughout the history of the captive population despite successful captive breeding since 1970. Bat-eared Foxes can coexist well with other species and are frequently seen in African plains exhibits at zoos.<br/><br/>Little is known about dispersal of young and the formation of new breeding pairs. The causal factors for differences in home range size in different localities, group size and changes in density as a function of food availability are poorly known. In the Serengeti, behavioural evidence on group and pair formation and the existence of 'super families', consisting of one male and up to three closely related breeding females, raises interesting questions about regular inbreeding between males and their daughters from several generations (see Maas 1993a).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Red Foxes are adaptable and opportunistic omnivores and are capable of successfully occupying urban areas. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with people, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas.","Red Foxes have been recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert (though not extreme deserts) and forest, as well as in city centres (including London, Paris, Stockholm, etc.). Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with abundant ""edge"" of scrub and woodland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains (even above the treeline, known to cross alpine passes), sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4,500 m. In the United Kingdom, they generally prefer mosaic patchworks of scrub, woodland and farmland. Red Foxes flourish particularly well in urban areas. They are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing and are less common where industry, commerce or council rented housing predominates (Harris and Smith 1987). In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with people, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas.","Threats to this species are highly localized and include habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation, and exploitation, and direct and indirect persecution. For example, a regional red list assessment in Mongolia (Clark and Munkhbat&#160;2006) classified the species as Near Threatened mainly due to overhunting, while in South Korea, Red Foxes have experienced declines due to habitat loss and poaching and is generally considered extinct (Yu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, their general versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. Red Foxes have caused considerable damage where they have been introduced; their impacts on Australian fauna has been particularly well documented; control takes place by setting baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate).","Red Fox density is highly variable. In the United Kingdom, density varies between one fox/40 km² in Scotland and 1.17/km² in Wales, but can be as high as 30 foxes/km² in some urban areas where food is superabundant (Harris 1977, Macdonald and Newdick 1982, Harris and Rayner 1986). Social group density is one family per km² in farmland, but may vary between 0.2-5 families/km² in the suburbs (Macdonald 1981). Fox density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is three foxes/km² (Meia 1994). Murdoch (2009) recorded 0.17 foxes/km²&#160;&#160;in the grassland/semi desert steppe of Mongolia.&#160;In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, they occur at densities of 0.1 foxes/km², and in southern Ontario, Canada at 1 fox/km² (Voigt 1987). The average social group density in the Swiss mountains is 0.37 families/km² (Weber <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The pre-breeding British fox population has been estimated at ~240,000 individuals (Harris <em>et al.</em> 1995). Mean number of foxes killed per unit area by gamekeepers has increased steadily since the early 1960s in Britain, but it is not clear to what extent this reflects an increase in fox abundance. Although an increase in fox numbers following successful rabies control by vaccination was widely reported in Europe (e.g., fox bag in Germany has risen from 250,000 in 1982–1983 to 600,000 in 2000–2001), no direct measures of population density have been taken.",Stable,"The Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million km²) being distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to southern North America, Europe, North Africa, the Asiatic steppes, India, and Japan.

Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the European Union, Canada, and the Russian Federation, trapping methods are regulated under an agreement on international trapping standards between these countries, which was signed in 1997. Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the United Kingdom and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained ""use"" may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport – the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint – hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs.

Specifically, two sets of camera-trap photos from potentially important areas of eastern Cambodia were not examined.</span></p><p></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>However, the species is most likely to be extinct. At most, there could only be a few individuals remaining, certainly many fewer than 250 mature individuals, and almost certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. The high level of hunting in the region has led to a significant decline, suspected at over 80% in the last 30 years (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), with a continued decline in any remaining subpopulations, if in fact it is not already extinct.</p>","Little is known of its biology and ecology, the only significant work being that of Wharton (1957). The species travels in small herds, primarily of females and calves, of up to 20 animals, which commonly associate with Banteng. Mature males form bachelor herds. The Kouprey is reported to have a diet of grasses, sedges, and some browse (Wharton 1957).<br/><br/>The Kouprey was primarily an animal of open deciduous dipterocarp forests, especially those areas with extensive grasslands. Although deciduous dipterocarp forests are extensive in Cambodia, and also in parts of adjoining countries (especially Lao PDR and Viet Nam), the preferred sites of Kouprey are much more localised, and perhaps account for less than 30% of the total area of the lowland mosaic forests dominated by deciduous dipterocarp forest (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, AWCSG 2011). The species appeared to use patches of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest which also occur in such landscapes. Most of the Kouprey's range lies in a highly seasonal area receiving less than 2,000 mm of precipitation per annum. The terrain in this area is generally flat or undulating lowlands. The presence of pools and mineral licks was certainly important.","Hunting, both for local consumption and for trade (meat and body parts, especially horns and skulls), is (or, if the species is extinct, was) the major threat throughout the Kouprey's range (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005). This trade value pre-dates the meteoric rise in volume and financial value of wildlife trade out of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia during the 1990s and 2000s. Salter&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) found three sets of male and two sets of female Kouprey horns (all reportedly from Cambodia) in a village in southern Champasak Province (southern Lao PDR). The male horns were valued by the owner at USD 4,000 and the female horns at USD 1,600 per set. During a trip to Amphoe Muang (Mukdahan Province, Thailand, on the border with Lao) on 29 March 1991, Kouprey parts were found to be available at one vendor. Horns were not on display but customers could examine photographs in an album: female Kouprey horns were offered at USD 6,000-8,000 per pair and male horns at USD 2,000 per pair. The male horns were polished so that the shredded ends could not be seen. During a second visit (in July 1991) the same vendor's stall was less active and no Kouprey trophies were on offer (although Gaur and Banteng could still be ordered). Wild cattle trophies were on offer at other vendors but no Kouprey horns or skulls were for sale at these stalls (Srikosamatara&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992). During a visit to Ban Mai (Thai/Lao border) by Srikosamatara and his colleagues in April 1993 a vendor of wildlife products claimed to have sold a pair of Kouprey horns to a Thai buyer for USD 800 two years before. He also claimed to have two more sets of Kouprey horns (both old males) for sale at USD 2,800 and USD 12,000 respectively. Three months later (July 1993) another survey (by I. Baird) found no Kouprey trophies for sale at the same vendors (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994). Bounties for Kouprey trophy horns were still believed to circulate in SE Asia as of 2010 (AWCSG 2011).<br/><br/>Diseases from domestic and/or free-ranging livestock could have disastrous consequences given the already severely reduced Kouprey population. Habitat loss as a result of the rapidly increasing land clearance for cultivation (local and commercial), mining and logging, as well as increasing levels of other human disturbances, are also threats, but are insignificant compared with hunting (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, see also 2008 account for Banteng). Many wildlife species of high monetary value still remain widespread and, relative to neighbouring countries, abundant in the extensive lowland forests of Cambodia, and with the fall of the Khmer Rouge and a rapidly growing free market economy there has been a surge of hunting to supply bushmeat, trophy antler/horn and medicinal markets, which is leading in many cases to very rapid declines in large quarry species (e.g. macaques have declined in some areas by over 90% in as little as five years; Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), thus, however, rare Kouprey becomes it will continually be at risk because, unlike in a single-quarry species system where at certain levels it becomes uneconomic to seek out the last few individuals, hunting levels will remain high, fuelled by returns from the more common species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Wild Oxen in Cambodia are now low in number and in most areas now rare or already hunted out (see IUCN Red List accounts for Banteng, Gaur and Wild Water Buffalo). Knowledge of the Kouprey is widespread among rural people in Cambodia, concerning its rarity and the value of trophies and perhaps other body parts; as such it is a more desirable target than most in Cambodia.","At an international workshop, held in Viet Nam in January 1988, reports were presented which suggested that there were about 27 Koupreys in Viet Nam, possibly 40-100 in the Lao PDR, and up to 200 in Cambodia, with perhaps a seasonal presence of a few animals in Thailand. These figures, which were little more than guesses, suggested that a total of about 100-300 Koupreys still existed in the late1980s. Unfortunately, it now seems that these figures were too optimistic, especially for Lao and Viet Nam where surveys in the 1990s were unable to document even large significant populations of other species of wild oxen (Cox <em>et al. </em>1991, 1992; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al. </em>1997; Duckworth and Hedges 1998; Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000; Cox <em>et al</em>. 1991, 1992; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers of wild oxen were, however, much higher in Cambodia, even though, within the vast extents of habitat, their densities were already low as documented during an aerial survey of a large part of eastern Cambodia in 1994 (Olivier and Woodford 1994).<br/><br/>The last published records of Koupreys are those of C. Wharton, who lead an expedition to capture Koupreys in 1963/64 (Wharton 1966). In 1969, J. Mellon saw two female Koupreys in the Chhep/Melouprey area of Cambodia, and in 1993 he was of the opinion that there might still be Koupreys in the area (J. Mellon <em>in litt</em> to D. Ashwell 1993). Later reports were also received by Pfeffer (1974 <em>in litt</em>. to IUCN/CMC). In the 1964-1970 period, Pfeffer undertook five expeditions to Indochina (each three months long) during which he collected information about kouprey and ""took the only reasonable photograph of a wild kouprey"" (Kemf 1988, Pfeffer and Ou Kim-San 1967, Pfeffer 1969). None of the evidence for Koupreys since Mellon's time, based on second-hand reports, hearsay, equivocal track identification or trophy horns (found in villages or wildlife markets and which could plausibly date back to Wharton's era) (e.g. MacKinnon and Stuart 1989, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003), has been particularly convincing in suggesting that viable populations of Koupreys remain; rather it suggests that a very rapid demise occurred. Wharton (1957) observed Koupreys to occur, even in what was considered optimal habitat, in lower numbers than Banteng&#160;<em>Bos javanicus</em> (his figures and other observations suggest a ratio of somewhere between 1:2 and 1:10), and suggested that, because of their restricted range and habitat specificity, Kouprey was at elevated risk of extinction compared with the other wild cattle.&#160;<br/><br/>Extensive survey work has now documented where significant wild cattle populations remain within the historical range of Kouprey, and in no area other than eastern Cambodia are wild cattle numbers high (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011). In most areas wild cattle numbers are so low (low dozens of individuals scattered through hundreds of square kilometres of habitat) that it is no longer conceivable that Kouprey could survive (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003, RJ. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). An assessment of 90% of camera trap photos from the region including the potential range of the Kouprey was made in 2011 (AWCSG 2011). Although Banteng, Wild Water Buffalo <em>Bubalus arnee</em>, and Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> were all recorded from the region, there were no camera trap images of Kouprey. A careful gap analysis of potential Kouprey sites was part of the first step of the study, but not all the relevant data could be examined. The majority of images from at least seven projects known to have captured wild cattle were not reviewed. This included two sets of photos from potentially important areas of eastern Cambodia. None of the landscapes assessed were sufficiently surveyed to rule out the presence of Kouprey, and for the foreseeable future, it will be impossible to identify every remaining individual wild ox to species in such areas. But there are no defensible grounds for considering the population of Kouprey to be anything other than negligible in such areas (single individuals or 2-3 animals), primarily because of the naturally lower densities of Kouprey compared with Banteng, the habitat specificity of Kouprey and its exceptional value in trade (Wharton 1957, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In eastern Cambodia there has now been substantial survey work (including observation-based field surveys and camera-trapping) which has documented hundreds of both Banteng and Gaur and even small numbers of Wild Water Buffalo (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. D. Evans and T. Clements pers. comm. 2008, Gray and Phan 2011, AWCSG 2011). This, in addition to suggesting Kouprey really has been hunted out, gives good numerical grounds to be confident that kouprey (historically the rarer species) no longer occurs in the ratio found by Wharton and that Kouprey declined significantly faster and was almost certainly less resilient to hunting than are the other species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Certainly fewer than 5,000 wild cattle now survive within the historical range of Kouprey, 90% or more of those within Cambodia and the majority of those within the eastern provinces (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). If Kouprey still survives, it is certainly only as individuals (not functional groups) in very low numbers; its extinction, if not yet upon us, is almost certainly sealed. Therefore future recommendations focus on protection of areas with the highest probability of harbouring Kouprey that are also high priority sites for other wildlife species, and further review of camera trap photos; rather than further survey efforts (AWCSG 2011).",Decreasing,"The historical distribution of this species was Cambodia, southern Lao PDR, southeast Thailand, and western Viet Nam (Grubb 2005).&#160;However, there is no recent (post-1970) confirmation in any of these countries and because of the obvious major declines in all congeners in this region in this period, this species is now thought to be possibly extinct.<p></p>","Kouprey is probably extinct, but if it persists it faces opportunistic hunting whenever encountered.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. If the species is still extant it is most likely to be in eastern Cambodia in one of four protected areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Mondulkiri Protection Forest and or Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area) (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011). There are no Kouprey in captivity, one existed in Vincennes Zoo, Paris, in 1937 and survived for about five years. There have been suggestions that domesticated Kouprey may survive in Cambodia (Hassanin <em>et al</em>. 2006). However this seems unlikely&#160;(R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and&#160; recent analysis of several nuclear genes revealed that a domesticated specimen was a hybrid between female Kouprey and male <em>Bos taurus</em>&#160;(Handschuh and Hassanin&#160;2013).&#160;<br/><br/>It is unlikely that specific survey work for Kouprey would produce any better evidence than has already been documented, and the best conservation measures for the species now would be to concentrate on <em>in situ</em> protection activities for large mammal communities in eastern Cambodia, especially building upon and strengthening the existing projects within the Srepok Wilderness Area of the Mondulkiri Protection Forest and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area (AWCSG 2011).",Indomalayan,last absolute confirmed date is 1969/70,true,false,Global

The remaining world population totals under 4,000, with an estimate of fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. An inferred population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations (generation length estimated at 8–10 years) seems likely given the severity of the threats, especially hybridization; it is projected to continue into the future.<p></p>","<p>Wild Water Buffalo is very dependent on the availability of water and historically its preferred habitats were low-lying alluvial grasslands including <em>bheels</em> (ox-bow lakes and similar pools left by changing river courses) and their surrounds; river banks, and <em>chaporis</em> (small sandy islands within braided river systems). Riparian forests and woodlands were also used (Lydekker 1924, Prater 1971, Choudhury 1994).</p>  <p>The present distribution of Wild&#160;Water&#160;Buffalo should not be necessarily regarded as indicating its preference for particular ecotypes because human activities have largely excluded it from many areas.</p>  <p>In Nepal it now occurs only in the seasonally flooded grasslands and mixed forests of the SaptKosi floodplain. Dahmer (1978) provided a description of Buffalo habitat and habitat use in the area.&#160; In Bhutan and Assam, it occurs in alluvial grasslands along the Manas and Brahmaputra rivers—for more details about habitat characteristics in these areas see for example Spillet (1966), Lahan and Sonowal (1973),&#160;Jain and Hajra (1975),&#160;and Parihar <em>et al</em>. (1986). In the Bastar region of Madhya Pradesh (now Chhattisgarh) Buffalo inhabits tropical dry deciduous forests with an understorey dominated by grasses. It has also been reported to occur in the Sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>) forests in the area (Daniel and Grubh 1966, Mishra 2003). In Thailand it is now restricted to grasslands, mixed deciduous forest, and dry evergreen forest along rivers in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Nakhasathien and Stewart-Cox 1990; Uicharoensak 1992). In Sri Lanka Buffalo is particularly associated with grasslands, scrubby grasslands, and discontinuous forest areas. During the dry season it spends more of its time in forested areas (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Ashby and Santiapillai 1983).</p>  <p>Buffaloe spend considerable amounts of their time lying and wallowing in pools of water and/or mud. Where large pools of water are not available, Buffaloes will make use of smaller depressions, providing some moisture remains which they can churn to a muddy consistency. Wallowing has a thermoregulatory function. Buffaloes have fewer sweat glands per unit area of skin than do cattle and evaporative cooling through sweating is of little importance. Mud is considered more effective at cooling animals than is clean water because the water that is held in the mud evaporates slowly and so prolongs the cooling effect. Some reports suggest that for species such as Buffalo wallowing is essential for their survival but Tulloch’s (1970) studies of feral buffaloes in Australia do not support this conclusion; instead his results indicate that when buffaloes are deprived of wallows they behave more like cattle and seek shade (Tulloch 1970). Running water is also used for bathing (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Wallowing has the additional function of providing a thick coating of mud on the body that protects the animals from insect bites. </p>  <p>Buffaloes are very loyal to traditional trails and use the same routes repeatedly and this can lead to considerable erosion, particularly where trails cut down to river courses.</p>  <p>Information on the habitat use of feral <em>Bubalus bubalis</em> in Australia is provided by Tulloch (1969, 1970, 1979). Although, most of the habitat of Wild Buffalo is swampy, in Central India hard-ground habitats are used by Wild Buffalo where most of the water sources are human-made. The animals prefer dense forest during day time for grazing/browsing while they may feed in open forest with patchy grasslands during night. The use of water bodies is more common in the evening and late night due to human pressures in Udanti WLS (WTI 2012).&#160;</p><p>Research in both Assam and Sri Lanka has shown that herd movements are closely related to climatic factors, as one would expect from an animal so dependent on the availability of water. During the wet season in both regions Wild Water Buffalo tends to be widely dispersed and occur in small herds, but with the onset of the dry season the buffaloes tend to gather at permanent water holes and large aggregations can develop ( Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). In Wilpattu NP in Sri Lanka the herds of female Buffaloes and their offspring that are thought to be of the wild-type (the ‘forest buffalo’ of Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) remain attached to certain areas for long periods (i.e. they have well-defined home-ranges). As water sources begin to dry-out and forage availability declines these ranges may shift but they return to their original home ranges with the arrival of the rains. Males, especially subadults and the younger adults, tend to move over considerable distances during the mating season. A similar pattern of seasonal movements and site attachment has been reported from elsewhere in Sri Lanka particularly Ruhuna NP (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). The movements of animal are individually or in herds. The home range of Wild Water Buffalo in Udanti sanctuary is almost fixed and ranges between 15 and 20 km²,&#160;mostly around permanent water holes where there is no human disturbance (Mishra 2001, 2003).&#160;</p>  <p>Little published information is available about the daily movements of Wild Water Buffalo. In undisturbed areas it is reported to feed in the open at dusk and dawn, moving into cover and/or lying in wallows during the heat of the day. Nevertheless (feral) buffaloes will feed in open areas at mid-day, returning at intervals to shade and/or wallows.&#160;Daily movements of feral buffaloes are often rather predictable. Certain places within the home ranges of (feral) buffaloes are visited very frequently; these include latrines, rest areas (‘camps’), pools, mud-wallows, and particular trees, often close to wallows, against which buffaloes rub themselves (‘rubbing trees’). Obvious trails join these frequently used features.&#160;Wild Water Buffaloes are generally averse to human disturbance and seek refuge in the remotest habitats, the solitary bulls who seek domestic buffaloes for mating being an exception.&#160; In both Indravati and Pamed the Wild Water Buffalo prefers to come out during night only, whereas it is normally diurnal.&#160; Kotapalli villagers near Pamed reported buffaloes coming at 05.00 hours to the waterhole and disappearing after dawn.&#160;</p>  <p>The strong attachment of Wild Water Buffalo to known ranges can have unfortunate consequences particularly when water and/or food are scarce. Feral buffaloes (in Australia) have been known to die of thirst rather than walk approximately five kilometres to a large lagoon used by other buffaloes (Tulloch 1970). They are thought to range as high as 1500m asl (S. Hedges pers. comm. to Choudury 2014) in the Western Ghats.</p>  <p>Little has been published on the diet of wild (or feral) <em>Bubalus bubalis</em>. It is probably a grazer by preference, feeding mainly on grasses when available, but it also eat herbs, fruits, and bark as well as browsing trees and shrubs. Daniel and Grubh (1966) list <em>Cynodon dactylon</em>, <em>Themeda quadrivalvis</em>, and <em>Coix</em> sp. as grasses that are known to be eaten by Wild Water Buffalo in India. They also saw Buffalo feeding on the sedge <em>Cyperus corymbosus</em>. Dahmer (1978), Shrestha (1981), and Kushwaha (1986) provide a little information about the diet of Buffalo in Nepal. Wild Water Buffalo also feed on crops, including rice, sugar cane, and jute, sometimes causing considerable damage (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Kushwaha 1986, Bauer 1987).&#160;</p>  <p>Wild Water Buffalo is reported to be a selective feeder and to wander long distances in the course of grazing (Daniel and Grubh 1966). Feral buffaloes in Australia also graze selectively &#160;according to Tulloch <em>et al</em>. (1986) but Moran (1987) reported that they are far less selective than are Brahman cattle. Buffaloes in Sri Lanka are reported to eat nearly anything in their path (Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). Wild Water Buffalo seems to have a higher tolerance for saline water than do many mammals and will drink from brackish pools (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972).</p>  <p>The Wild Water Buffalo may invade farmland to depredate crops like rice, <em>Dolichos biflorus</em>, <em>Vicoa mungo </em>and <em>Brassica campestris </em>(Mishra 2002, 2004; WTI 2009).</p>Typically, it forms maternal groups of loosely structured herds, typically containing 10–20, but up to 100, individuals, year round. Adult males form bachelor herds of up to 10 individuals, with older males often solitary. The species exhibits a polygynous mating system, with females typically giving birth to single offspring, although twins are possible. It is a seasonal breeder in most of its range, typically in October and November, however, some populations breed year round. Its gestation lasts 10-11 months, with an interbirth interval of one year. Age at sexual maturity is 18 months for males, and three years for females. The maximum known lifespan is 25 years in the wild (Nowak 1999).","<p>The major threats to Wild Water Buffalo are loss of genetic diversity due to introgression with domestic and feral buffaloes, as well as threats from hunting, and disease from domestic livestock.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Genetic Factors</strong></p>  <p>It is highly likely that the existence of Wild Water Buffalo is being threatened by genetic introgression from domestic buffaloes in Nepal (Flamand <em>et al</em>. 2003). In India, hybridisation is thought to be evident in the North-east where wild buffaloes are known to hybridise with <em>Khunti</em> (cattle camp) buffaloes which were grazed within the park prior to their eviction (Muley 2001). However, it was suggested that there is a genetic differentiation between wild and domestic/feral buffaloes in Kaziranga National Park, and that the Wild Water Buffalo is comparable to Wild Water Buffalo in central India (CCMB 2010). Although, the central Indian buffaloes do live along with hybrid and feral buffaloes, so introgression could have occurred to some degree in both locations. Introgression is likely to take place throughout the range wherever wild and domestic buffalo come into contact. It is estimated that more than 90% of the population exists in the vicinity of considerable populations of Domestic Water Buffalo (See Table 1. in the Supporting Information: <em>B. arnee</em> additional information populations in vicinity of Domestic Water Buffalo). This means there is a the risk of hybridisation&#160;is high. As the wild populations shrink &#160;and become fragmented the risk of hybridisation increases exponentially (within a few generations). Given the fragmented nature of the populations and the proximity of Domestic Water Buffalo, and applying the precautionary principle, the truly pure Wild Water Buffalo population could half of the current estimated population, or less.&#160;</p>  <p>In evolutionary terms wild and domesticated water buffaloes are closely related, being separated by perhaps as little as 5,000 years (Cockrill 1974, S. Hedges in prep). The phylogeny of buffaloes has not been fully resolved and it is unclear as to the number of domestication events that have occurred in the case of this species. At least two separate domestications, one for ‘swamp’ and one for ‘river’ type buffalo are thought to have taken place (Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Yindee <em>et al</em>. 2010, Babar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) Additionally, the practise in some villages, of allowing wild buffalo to sire calves with domestics (Flamand <em>et al</em>. 2003) may have resulted in continued gene flow between the two, at least in one direction. The situation is analogous to other species which are the progenitors of domesticated forms especially that of the wild cat <em>Felis</em> (Beaumont <em>et al.</em> 2001. This may be particularly the case in Indochina where traditional methods of Domestic Water Buffalo husbandry allowed animals to wander freely for the majority of the year, often in natural habitat over 5 km from villages; indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether animals in forest areas are domesticated or truly feral; as such before hunting largely eliminated the Wild Water Buffalo population there must have been much contact between the two species, and presumably a great deal of opportunity for introgression, albeit perhaps strongly in one direction, given the male-dominated mating system of water buffalo (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Domestic Water Buffalo in ‘frontier’ rural areas of Indochina often show a strong similarity to published and other widely available images of Thai and Indian Wild Water Buffaloes (R. J Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), while Clark (undated) wrote that neither local people nor experienced hunters could distinguish Wild and Domestic Water Buffaloes on the basis of physical appearance, on the Lagna (La Ngà) River alluvial plains of southern Vietnam where the two occurred together, and that they were only identifiable on the basis of their behaviour: further evidence that the genepools of Indochinese Domestic Water Buffalo and Wild Water Buffalo are probably very close.&#160;</p>  <p>Whilst it is likely that the genetic integrity of Wild Water Buffalo is threatened by introgression from the domestic form, the risk of inbreeding within the dwindling populations of Wild Buffalo must not be underestimated as a threat to its survival. Small populations are at risk of inbreeding depression (i.e. lowered reproductive fitness) which can in turn lead to further population decline (Hendrick and Kalinowski 2000). The small population size of Wild Water Buffalo in central India (34–42 individuals), means that there is a high risk of extinction through demographic factors (WTI 2010). For example, stochastic variation in demographic rates causes small populations to fluctuate randomly in size. Wild Water Buffalo in some populations may face the risk of inbreeding effects through low population numbers. Whilst introgression with domestic forms may paradoxically have the ability to mitigate some of the inbreeding risk by injecting genetic diversity, it carries with it the risk of erosion of the genetic diversity unique to the wild form (as mentioned above).&#160;</p>  <p>A challenge to the captive breeding of wild buffalo will be balancing the relative risks of inbreeding and out breeding when choosing candidate animals for a breeding programme. This is likely to require a detailed level of genetic screening, the technical challenges of which must not be underestimated (Randi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since introgressed buffaloes may outnumber non-introgressed Wild Buffaloes considerably, it may be necessary to view introgressed animals as a vital genetic resource from which wild genetic diversity can be recaptured through controlled backcrossing, as opposed to viewing them as animals tainted by domestic introgression.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Hunting</strong></p>  <p>Wild Buffaloes have for long been hunted ritually, owing to their formidable nature and horns. Besides sport hunting that was prolific until the 1960s, hunting for meat is also a popular practice in several parts of North-east India as well as in many South-east Asian countries. With legal protection of Wild Water Buffalo in India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Thailand (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2008), the severity of hunting may have reduced over the recent past. Although poaching for wild meat is still a real threat to any remaining Wild Water Buffalo populations in South-east Asia, especially Cambodia and Myanmar, trophy hunting may be the most worrying threat, especially if general knowledge of the existence of remnant populations grows, as the economic growth in the region has seen massive growth in exploitation of valuable natural resources, such as wildlife-derived status symbols (R.J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>  <p>However, <em>Paradh</em>, traditional community hunting, still persists in some part of central India (Mishra 2000). Also, extensive droughts and habitat fragmentation and degradation have caused Wild Water Buffaloes habitually to invade and raid crops, leading to repercussions by local villagers. This perhaps single-handedly has led to a severe population decline in many states such as in Chhattisgarh.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Disease</strong></p>  <p>One of the persistent threats to wildlife is the threat of disease outbreaks from livestock raised in the surrounding villages.&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">For instance, several sub-populations of &#160;another large bovid, the Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>), in peninsular India, were known to have been almost exterminated through a severe outbreak of Rinderpest in 1968 (Krishnan 1972). Similarly, Wild Water Buffaloes are also susceptible to a number of cattle diseases, and therefore, where very small populations remain, they face the risks of extinction due to disease.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation: </strong></p>  <p>Wild Buffaloes like most other large herbivores, require large spaces with adequate food and water supply to survive which is negatively impacted by fragmentation and degradation of forest and grassland areas. Although most cattle camps have been removed from within Kaziranga in Assam, extensive livestock grazing in Chhattisgarh may place the Wild Water Buffaloes there in situations of severe resource competition. This is because of pasture depletion and lack of water resources, which could lead to direct conflict.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Local community and insurgency</strong></p>  <p>There are areas in central India where Wild Water Buffalo exists and there are difficulties of insurgency and law and order problems. The result is that in such areas, conservation is often difficult to achieve without the support of local people.&#160;</p>  <p>Probably one of the most significant constraints, is an under appreciation even amongst conservation organisations of the importance, significance and plight of Wild Water Buffalo populations (Choudhury 2010). This is exemplified by the situation in Cambodia where next-to-no species-specific action has been taken for Wild Water Buffalo, despite the known presence of a remnant population in one area, with to date the fear that the population may have declined and possibly even been lost (R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013).<em></em></p>","<p>The total world population of Wild Water Buffalo is almost certainly less than 4,000 animals, occupying an area of less than 20,000 km². However, these figures are little more than informed guesses, because any assessment of buffalo numbers is hampered by the difficulty of distinguishing between free-ranging domestic buffaloes, feral buffaloes, truly wild buffaloes, and hybrids between wild and other buffaloes. Individuals of Wild Water Buffalo and Domestic Water Buffalo are difficult to distinguish in some areas, and some domestic populations may be very closely related to (perhaps identical to) Wild Water Buffalo, as in Cambodia, where traditional forms of buffalo husbandry allow herds to range freely in forest areas (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) or in Kaziranga, India, where in the past cattle camps for grazing wild buffalos existed within the National Park (Choudhury 2010). There have been few detailed analyses of the purity of the presumed remaining Wild Water Buffalo populations, however a benchmark for the purity of the species remains a question. The Domestic Water Buffalo occurs as feral and domesticated populations worldwide, including in sympatry with most remaining populations of Wild Water Buffalo (Grubb 2005, S. Hedges pers comm. 2008). Some feral and domestic populations may well have conservation significance, retaining some of the genetic stock of the wild populations for that particular region, this may be especially true in Indochina because of traditional methods of Water Buffalo husbandry (S. Hedges pers comm. 1994, 2008; Timmins and Ou 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008); and continues to be a matter for debate in the islands of the Sundas and Sri Lanka, where prehistoric presence of Wild Water Buffalo seems likely, but the Holocene history of human manipulation of Domestic Water Buffalo severely clouds the determination of how to treat remaining populations of free living water buffaloes there.&#160;</p>  <p>In India a preliminary investigation comparing genetic traits of the northeastern and the central Indian population suggested that both populations to be related with the Kaziranga samples showing differentiation into three district clades of wild, mixed and feral. The Central Indian population showed no such distinctions (CCMB 2010).<br/><br/> Within India, Choudhury (1994) suggests that there could be about 3,300-3,500 animals in northeast India alone, although later he revised the figure to 2,800-3,000 individuals (Choudhury 2010).</p><p>According to Divekar and Bhushan (1988), the total estimate of Wild Buffalo population in Chhattisgarh (Central India) was 104, whereas an estimate by the Forest Department in the year 1986-87 was perhaps an exaggerated 240. Divekar and Bhushan (1988) estimated about 26 Wild Buffaloes were restricted to the Pillur meadow and Pengonda area of Indravati NP, 25 each in Pamed Wildlife Sanctuary and Udanti Wildlife Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh. Ranjitsinh <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated the population in Udanti as between 42 and 44 with about 25-30 individuals in Indravati National Park. Mishra (2002, 2004) and Mishra and Kotwal (2003) estimated that less than 70 Wild Buffaloes occurred in Central India. There are presently eleven wild buffalo in Udanti with only one female (in captivity) and six wild males and one female&#160; calf. Therefore in two decades or so the population here has shown a massive decline.&#160;</p>  <p>The majority of the Wild Buffalo assemblage in India is restricted to the north-eastern states of India, with Assam accounting for most of the population spread across several protected areas of the state. The state of wild buffalo in northeast India is as follows:&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Assam </strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Kaziranga National Park: </em></strong>Kaziranga NP constitutes perhaps one of India's most important Wild Buffalo habitats, harbouring the largest aggregate of the species along with a number of flagships, including the Indian one horned rhinoceros and the Asian elephant. Kaziranga NP, spans over 850 Km<sup>2 </sup>over three districts of Assam, and has approximately 2,600 individuals as per the departmental counts in 2011.<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Manas National Park:</em></strong> Situated across two districts of Assam, namely, Baksa and Chirang, and covering around 500 km² of rich habitats, the park is known to harbour around 250 individuals reported during the 2008 census. The adjoining reserve forest areas bound between the national park and the Sankosh river in the west, are believed to hold an additional 30 or more individuals.&#160;</p>  <p><strong><em>Dibru-Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary: </em></strong>Located along the Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts of Assam, and spanning over 340 km² of riverine tracts and willow swamp forests, the park is thought to shelter more than 400 Wild Buffaloes, as per the 2008 census (Choudhury 2010).&#160;</p>  <p>Besides the above, several other areas in Assam have been reported to harbour Wild Buffalo herds, both in the past as well as in the present. Of these, Borachapori and Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuaries have been found to harbour around 75 individuals (Choudhury 2010), while Pabha Reserve Forests adjoining Borachapori WLS also harbour dispersing individuals as well as seasonally migrant herds from Borachapori. Additionally, other areas of Assam, such as the Kadam Reserve Forests and the Dhakuakhana area of Lakhimpur district, were both known to hold small populations, but today are known to harbour only a few straggler individuals. In fact a survey in 2009 in Kadam Reserve Forests revealed only a single lone bull in the area. Additionally the Dum Duma Reserve Forests along the Lohit river, have revealed around 13+ Wild Buffaloes by Choudhury (1994), although no earlier records of the species’ presence in this area exits. </p>  <p>Lastly, a number of areas, including the discontinuous patches of forests and grasslands of Kollolua-Jokai, the reserve forests of Batabari and Doadhara, Orang National Park, Pabitora WLS, Gali, Jamjing, Sengajan and Kobo Chapori Reserve Forests of Dhemaji district, the Kakoi, Dulung, as well as the Sonai-Rupai WLS and Pabho Reserve Forest patches of Lakhimpur district, have all been viable habitats of the Wild Buffalo in the past, but have unfortunately lost all traces of the species over the recent past. A few of the above areas however, intermittently harbour either small herd of feral buffaloes of highly decimated remnants of erstwhile populations, mostly represented by few stragglers.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Meghalaya</strong></p>  <p>Very few historical accounts of the presence of Wild Buffaloes in the state of Meghalaya exist. However, more recent reports suggest that small, low density populations may exist in the Balapakram National Park of the state as well as a few remnant herds in the Nokrek National Park. Choudhury (2010) has suggested that no more than 50 individuals possibly thrive in this part of the landscape, although more systematic species-specific surveys may be needed in these areas to confirm the presence of remnants of the true Wild Buffalo.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Arunachal Pradesh</strong></p>  <p>A state with an unlikely terrain for the existence of the Wild Buffalo, it is nonetheless thought to bear a few individuals in the D’ering WLS and the Lohit Valley in the Lohit district of the state. Additionally, the Mebo Reserve Forests in East Siang district were also thought to have around 20-25 individuals surviving until the 1960s, although current status suggests that the species is now non-existent.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>West Bengal</strong></p>  <p>Although a number of areas in the state of West Bengal have been reported to have sustained several small subpopulations of Wild Buffalo, especially in the Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts, currently no recognized Wild Buffalo populations exist in the state. The last accounts of the species from the state date back to almost 1928 (Choudhury 2010).<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Bihar</strong></p>  <p>The state is known to have sustained widely distributed populations of the species in the past (Ali 1927), especially in the northern areas of Purnea, Sharsa and Darbhanga districts. Although it is now recognized to have gone extinct from the state, post the 1960’s (Daniel and Grubh 1966). </p>  <p><strong>OTHER COUNTRIES</strong><strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Nepal</strong></p>  <p>The only remaining Wild Buffalo population today in Nepal exists in the Koshi-Tappu Wildlife Reserve, with around 220 individuals being tallied in 2008, through a census conducted by the reserve authorities. Besides this, remnant populations were also known to exist in the Chitwan National Park until the 1960s, and also in Bardia National Park until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century&#160;(Heinen, 1993, 2006, from Choudhury 2010).<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Bangladesh</strong></p>  <p>While numerous supopulations have been reported to have existed across the landscape of Bangladesh over varied periods of time, today almost no reports exist of wild sub-populations or even population remnants. Earlier, several reports on the presence of Wild Buffaloes have come from Fardipur, Chittagong hills, Shirajganj, Dinajpur and Bhola districts. Interestingly, reports from the Mymensingh and Sylhet districts suggest that small populations may have survived up to the earlier part of the twentieth century as well.<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Sri Lanka</strong></p>  <p>Although the Wild Buffaloes in Sri Lanka have been suspected to have originated from feral domestic stocks, owing to the historical absence of Wild Buffalo populations south of the Godavari river in India, the remnant populations today account for a substantial population of almost 2,000 individuals. This aggregate, nonetheless, is isolated largely to the Ruhuna National Park, in the south-eastern part of the country (de Silva <em>et al. </em>1994).&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Bhutan</strong></p>  <p>Some individuals (about 12) have been seen in Manas National Park (Rob Stenimetz pers obs.) and also in Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary (Kaul R. pers. comm).<strong>&#160;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Thailand</strong></p><p>Thailand today is known to harbour only a small population of Wild Buffaloes. About 35-40 individuals have been reported from the Huay Kha Khaeng WLS in western Thailand (Rob Steinmetz <em>pers. comm</em>). Additionally, small aggregates have also been reported from Khao Soi Dao WLS, although currently no information on their presence exists from here.</p>  <p><strong>Viet Nam</strong></p><p>Before 1999, there was reportedly a population in Mom Ray, Viet Nam, but this population no longer exists (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006). Rumours still persist of presence in other areas, for example the Satay region (Tordoff&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Wild buffaloes of the Cambodian population may wander into western Dak Lak province, but no recent records in Viet Nam have been confirmed to represent wild Water Buffalo (Le Xuan Canh&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997, Eames&#160;<em>et al. </em>2004, Tordoff&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).</p>  <p><strong>Cambodia</strong></p>  <p>Cambodia perhaps has the smallest population aggregates of the Wild Buffalo among the south-east Asian countries, although it was formerly excluded from the historical distribution range of the species. Camera trapping evidences of presumed wild buffaloes from four locations (7 encounters; 1-3 individuals per photograph) in the core area of Mondulkiri Protected Forest, west of the Srepok river in the year 2005 suggests that the species may be present in some areas (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005,&#160;Thompson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). However, ongoing camera trapping studies by WWF have failed to detect presence of any buffalos recently.&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Myanmar</strong></p><p>There is doubt about the status of with wild buffalo in Myanmar. Seems to be confirmed presence of wild buffalo from the Indo Myanmar border, along the Bulong&#160; river in the Sagaing state (Choudhury 2010). The genetic status of wild buffalo living in the Hukang Valley , north Myanmar is doubtful.&#160;</p><p><strong>Lao PDR</strong></p><p>The population on Lao PDR is extinct, but the date of local extinction is unknown&#160;(Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999).</p>",Decreasing,"During the Pleistocene epoch the genus <em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Bubalus </em>was widely distributed throughout Europe and southern Asia and contained forms conspecific with <em>B. arnee</em>. When the climate became drier the genus became restricted to the Indian subcontinent, mainland South-east Asia, and some of the South-east Asian islands. In historical times <em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">B. arnee</em> ranged across South and South-east Asia, occurring from Mesopotamia to Indochina (Esptein 1971, Mason 1974, Cockrill 1984).&#160;<p> Remnant populations of Wild Water Buffalo are thought to occur at single sites in each of southern Nepal, southern Bhutan, western Thailand, eastern Cambodia, and northern Myanmar, and at several sites in India: in the Central India and the North-east, predominantly in Assam.</p>  <p>Wild Water Buffalo is believed to be extinct in Bangladesh, Peninsular Malaysia, and on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. The domestic form (considered by IUCN as <em>B. bubalis</em>) occurs as feral and domesticated populations worldwide (Grubb 2005).<br/> <br/> Although the species has been speculated to have become extinct in Viet Nam, Myanmar and Cambodia (Corbet and Hill 1992), relatively recent surveys have revealed the confirmed presence of Wild Water Buffalo populations in Cambodia. Another recent survey along the Indo-Myanmar border confirmed the presence of small &#160;possibly remnant subpopulations of free ranging buffaloes along the Balong river in Sagaing state of Myanmar (from Choudhury 2010). Wild living water buffaloes in the Hukaung Valley, of northern Myanmar may or may not be of largely or purely Wild Water Buffalo origin (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006).&#160; <br/> <br/> The origin and current genetic status of the herds of apparently wild buffaloes in Sri Lanka is uncertain but it is thought unlikely that any true wild buffaloes remain there today. Corbet and Hill (1992) included Sri Lanka within the historical range of Wild Water Buffalo, although Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951), Gee (1964), and Maia (1970) thought that the Sri Lankan buffaloes were descended from introduced domestic stock. Certain ancient texts seem to support this view (Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). The fact that no buffaloes occur south of the Godavari river in India has also been taken to suggest that Sri Lanka possesses only feral buffaloes descended from introduced animals. However, Deraniyagala (1953), considered that the occurrence of fossil buffalo teeth in the gem sands of the Ratnapura area disproved this view, although it is not clear how old these buffalo teeth are (and Gaur remains found at similar depths in the same area were less than 1,000 years old). Moreover, morphometrics suggest that there was an ancestral population of animals on that island closer to Wild Water Buffalo than to Domestic Water Buffalo (Groves and Jayantha Jayawardene unpublished). Nevertheless, even if the Water Buffalo is indigenous to Sri Lanka the question of whether the free-living herds found there today should be treated as wild <em>B. arnee</em> still arises. In the nineteenth-century, free-ranging herds were common over much of the island’s dry low country but they were nearly eliminated by an outbreak of rinderpest at the end of the century, and for a time their survival was in doubt (Phillips 1935). Phillips reported that small populations might have survived in the hill country but the subsequent intensification of agriculture probably led to their demise (Ashby and Santiapillai 1983). After the rinderpest outbreak buffalo recolonized much of the dry zone but most of the animals had apparently interbred with domestic stock and in 1953 Deraniyagala wrote ‘[the] relatively purest herds are restricted to Yala Game Sanctuary, but much vigilance will be necessary if this remnant is to be kept free from domestic animals which are now encroaching upon this once inaccessible area’. Woodford (1979) also suggested that the genetic integrity of the wild form has already been lost in Ruhuna. To conclude, even if it is assumed that Wild Water Buffalo once occurred on Sri Lanka it seems unlikely that it survived the rinderpest outbreak and the subsequent genetic swamping by feral and domestic buffaloes: consequently all free-living buffalo populations on Sri Lanka almost certainly contain genetic input from domestic or feral stock.<br/> <br/> Neither Java nor Sumatra are included within the original range of wild <em>Bubalus arnee</em> as presented in many accounts. Nevertheless Stremme (1911) thought that the occurrence of the fossil <em>B. palaeokerabau</em> in Java made it probable that the buffaloes there belonged to the original fauna of the island (as Cuvier believed). Merkens (1927) also doubted, on historical grounds, the domestic origin of all free-living buffaloes on the island as did Mason (1974) who stated that domestic buffalo were present on Sumatra and Java long before the Hindus arrived almost 2,000 years ago. Moreover van der Maarel (1932) provisionally regarded the fossil specimens which he obtained from Java (and indeed <em>B. palaeokerabau</em>) as specifically indistinct from modern buffaloes, pointing to a Pleistocene presence of the species on the island (<em>cf</em>. Medway 1972). Corbet and Hill (1992) also thought it probable that wild buffaloes occur on Java and Sumatra. Despite the doubts raised by van der Maarel and Dammerman there is in fact little doubt that all the apparently wild buffaloes now living on Java and Sumatra are descended from domestic animals, or from Wild Water Buffaloes that have interbred with domestic and/or feral buffaloes (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Opinion is divided over whether to include Borneo within the historic range of the species. Corbet and Hill (1992) did not list it, and neither Mason (1974) nor Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered it likely that Water Buffalo was part of the indigenous fauna. Lydekker (1898), by contrast, described the small buffalo of Sarawak as a separate subspecies (<em>B. b. hosei</em>), although Mason (1974) thought that Lydekker was probably describing the feral animals which were common there. Cockrill (1968) suggested that traders from the Hindu empire in Sumatra may have introduced the buffalo in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and he did not think that there was any convincing evidence that would suggest that it was an indigenous species. Nevertheless, animal remains from the Niah caves indicate a Stone Age presence of buffalo in Sarawak (Harrisson 1961). Van Strien (1986) also considered it probable that <em>Bubalus bubalis</em> was part of the original fauna of the island and gave north-west Borneo as its current distribution. Harrisson, however, thought that the wild form was extinct. Feral (and semi-feral) buffaloes were formerly numerous throughout Borneo but the current status of the island’s feral population is poorly known. What does seem certain, however, is that even if the species is indigenous to the island (as seems to be the case) no true wild <em>B. arnee</em> occur there today since such animals would have been genetically swamped by the numerous feral animals some of which were descended from buffaloes introduced from outside Borneo (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).</p>","The Wild Water Buffalo is hunted for food, sport, and handicrafts products. Domestic Water Buffalo is considered a separate species, so its uses are not considered here, and additionally uses/markets for derivatives of the two species are likely to be largely independent of one another.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Wild Water Buffalo is included in CITES under Appendix III (Nepal). It is legally protected in Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Thailand. The Cambodia population was a major factor in the decision to place further protection on the area, now designated as Mondulkiri Protection Forest, and a significant factor in the decision to establish the Srepok Wilderness Area Project of the Cambodian Department of Forestry and WWF (Goodman <em>et al</em>. 2003; R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Most of the known populations are within protected areas. In Myanmar, which retains true lowland floodplains in near-natural state in the Hukaung Valley, the protected area system originally almost entirely excluded floodplain grasslands. The inclusion of some areas is now under consideration, and would benefit this species. However, the outcome is far from certain (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>Most remaining populations still require practical protection from hunting (especially those in Thailand and Cambodia, and Myanmar if still extant), but probably the greater threat in South Asia is protection from contact with other domestic bovines, especially Domestic Water Buffalo. <br/><br/>There is an urgent need to evaluate the integrity of wild-living buffalo populations, including those generally taken as being truly wild and those living as wild animals within the native range, using habitat typical of wild animals, and which have lived outside even occasional husbandry for a long time, in order to determine populations of conservation priority. This should involve the assessment of the relationship of such populations in the context of obvious domestic lineages, especially those in close proximity to wild populations. Such an approach should use multiple genetic markers in addition to an assessment of morphological characteristics. <br/><br/>Surveys to investigate current status of wild-living populations are needed in Myanmar and perhaps the Satay district of Viet Nam.<br/><p>In India, a Conservation Action Plan has been developed recently seeking to recover the Wild Water Buffalo in central India.

However, since then new data and a detailed range analysis based on all confirmed locations and habitat preferences revealed that the extent of occurrence is larger than previously thought, resulting in the species being downlisted to Vulnerable (in 2009). This reassessment of the species confirms its Vulnerable status, with a minor adjustment: in the 2009 assessment it was suspected that extent of occurrence (EOO) was shrinking for this species, however a re-examination of the available information concludes that although area of occupancy (AOO) is declining, there is no evidence at present to support declining EOO. Therefore the subcriterion B2b(i) is now removed from the assessment.<br/><br/>Recent analyses of the available habitat left for <em>B. torquatus</em> suggest that this species might have an area of occupancy of less than 1,000 km² (based on remaining forest within its highly fragmented range). Nevertheless, its area of occupancy and habitat are in continuing decline due to ongoing habitat loss and degradation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Furthermore, poaching might be a real threat, particularly in smaller forest fragments where the population is down to a few individuals. <em>Bradypus torquatus</em> is therefore listed as Vulnerable, with the caveat that a re-assessment should be performed as soon as more data on the wild populations become available.","<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">This largely arboreal species is found in wet tropical forest, most typically in areas with an annual precipitation of 1,200 mm or higher and lacking a dry season. Most records are from evergreen forests, and just a handful of sightings are from semi-deciduous forests (Hirsch and Chiarello 2012). It can be found in secondary forest habitats, including <em>cabrucas</em> (cocoa plantation under native forest in southern Bahia; Cassano <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). Some animals have been sighted in forest fragments as small as 20 ha, although the long-term persistence of populations at these sites is unknown. It is a strict folivore that feeds on a relatively small number of food plants; Chiarello (1998) found that leaves from 21 species formed 99% of the diet of three animals. Like other congeneric sloths, animals descend from trees periodically to urinate and defecate. The females give birth to one young annually, predominantly at the end of the wet season and beginning of the dry season (February-April), and copulation concentrates in the late dry and early wet seasons (August-October; Dias <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Sexual maturity is probably reached between the second and third year and longevity in the wild is over 12 years (Lara-Ruiz and Chiarello 2005).","<p>The rate of deforestation in the Atlantic forest of eastern Brazil has decreased dramatically in the last three decades but has not stopped (Ribeiro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009), so the pressure on habitat continues.

In other areas, native forests are cleared for other reasons, including coal production, agriculture and city sprawl.

It is thought likely that this species almost qualifies for a threatened category under criterion A2d due to ongoing exploitation levels, which have led to a decline in the order of 20% over three generations (suspected to be around 12 years).","This solitary species is found in desert, xeric grassland and shrubland, and Patagonian steppe habitats, always with sandy soils (including volcanic soil; Superina 2008). It can be found in some degraded habitats, such as pastureland and plantations. Animals have a relatively large home range within their arid habitat.

Numbers continue to decline due to poaching and disturbance from oil exploration. Latest field surveys indicate that the species has probably already reached the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion D (&lt;50 mature individuals).","The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby 2013). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby 2013, and references therein).<br/><br/>Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing. In the Sahel, movements tend to be north-south in direction, for example from the more arid desert to the less arid sub-desert and Sahel (Gillet 1965, Newby 1978). In central Niger, movement may also be east-west, for example from the open desert towards the better-wooded and more varied habitats of the Aïr and Termit mountains (Hue 1960). The Addax is well known for its utilisation of extremely desolate, inhospitable, and arid habitats (Dragesco-Joffé 1993).","The primary factor in the decline of Addax is uncontrolled hunting over many years, a process accelerating with the arrival of motor vehicles and modern weapons in the 20th century. Drought and the extension of pastoralism into desert lands, thanks to the increase in wells, have also taken a heavy toll, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Newby 2013). In recent years, the only near-viable population in Termit Tin Toumma NNR has been subject to disturbance by oil exploration and production and to shooting by their military escorts (Duncan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, political instability in Libya has caused an increase in traffic in the core area of Addax distribution and a new kind of opportunistic hunting has been developed by traffickers (T. Rabeil pers. comm).","Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby 2013). In 2013 the total global population was estimated at probably fewer than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Djourab sand sea in Chad (Newby 2013).&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma appears to be&#160;the last&#160;viable population of Addax in the world, with ground and aerial surveys carried out in 2004&#160;indicating a population of around 200 individuals&#160;(Wacher&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Sightings of Addax have declined since 2007. During a field trip carried out in June 2015 by the Sahara Conservation  Fund&#160;in&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma, no animals were seen during a thorough survey including all the shade trees, and only footprints of around 25 adults and three  calves were found (SCF 2015a)&#160; An aerial survey in March 2016 located only three living animals; remains of Addax and Dorcas Gazelle were also found, left by poachers (Rabeil 2016). The remaining animals are assumed to have been destroyed or dispersed. It is highly probable that there are now &lt;100 Addax left in the wild,  and perhaps many fewer. The species is at serious risk of becoming  extinct in the wild.",Decreasing,"Addax were formerly widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley, and present in suitable habitats in all countries sharing the Sahara Desert (Newby 2013). As with other ungulates of the Sahelo-Saharan fauna, the Addax has undergone an unprecedented reduction in geographical range&#160;(up to 99%)&#160;over the past century (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2013). The only known remaining population thought to be viable survives in the Termit/Tin Toumma region of Niger. However, there are sporadic records of small isolated groups and individuals from eastern Aïr Mountains/Western Ténéré desert in Niger, and from the Djourab region of western Chad (Newby 2013). Possible rare vagrants from these areas may be seen in northern Niger, southern Algeria and Libya (Newby 2013). There have been rumours of Addax along the Mali/Mauritania border (Majabat Al Koubra), but no confirmed sightings for several years. In early March 2007, the fresh tracks of about 15 Addax were seen in central Mauritania, in an area where they had not been reported for over 20 years (R. Vernet in Newby 2013), but these reports have not been followed up and it is unclear whether any Addax survive in Mauritania.","<p>Addax are subject to&#160;uncontrolled hunting for their meat, horns and hide; and levels of&#160;poaching have increased by both the armed forces and the local&#160;community (SCF 2015b).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"Listed on CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals) Appendix I and CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I, and included in the CMS Sahelo-Saharan Antelopes Action Plan (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al.</em> 2005).

The population is estimated at almost two million, of which about 50% are on private land (stable or increasing) and 25% in protected areas (stable). The remaining 25% are stable or decreasing. Its future is secure as long as it continues to occur in large, adequately protected and managed populations in protected areas and private farms and conservancies. Most of the largest populations are stable or increasing.","The Impala is a water-dependent and typical ecotone species, associated with light woodlands and savannahs, selecting open <em>Acacia </em>savannas with nutrient-rich soils providing good-quality grass, and high-quality browse in the dry season (Fritz and Bourgarel 2013). Impala are absent from montane ecosystems, recorded to about 1,700 m on the slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro (Grimshaw<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 1995). In their semi-arid environment, Black-faced Impala also select the interface between wooded savanna and open grassy vleis (Joubert 1971, Matson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).","The main threat to Common Impala seems to be active poaching at the edge of, and within, protected areas (with strong influence on densities as well as population structure) combined with agro-pastoral development (Setsaasa <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2007, Averbeck <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2009). Hunting risk is also likely to affect Impala behaviour, such as change in habitat selection or waterhole attendance (Crosmary <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Poaching, livestock development and severe drought were the main factors contributing to the decline of Black-faced Impala&#160;(Green and Rothstein 1998, East 1999). The reintroduction of 180 individuals from Kaokoland to the west of Etosha National Park between 1968 and 1971 helped promote the conservation of the Black-faced subspecies, and a few were translocated from Etosha to private game farms in Namibia (Fritz and Bourgarel 2013).&#160;However, the introduction of Common Impala to ranches and conservancies neighbouring Etosha National Park may represent a threat to the Black-faced&#160;Impala through hybridization. Green and Rothstein (1998) earlier estimated that about one-quarter of all privately owned Black-faced Impala occur in mixed herds with Common Impala. In a recent study, Lorenzen and Siegismund (2004) analysed 127 Black-faced Impala individuals from five subpopulations in Etosha National Park to determine whether any hybridization had taken place within the park, but could not find any definite evidence.","Population estimates are available for most of the Impala’s current range. East (1999) summed these estimates to produce a total population of 1,584,000 Common Impala and 2,200 Black-faced Impala, but the former does not allow for undercounting in aerial surveys or those areas for which population estimates are unavailable. Correcting for undercounting biases, East (1999) estimated the total numbers of Common Impala at ca 2 million. East's estimate of 2,200 for Black-faced Impala is slightly lower than that estimated by Green and Rothstein (1998), who estimated numbers in Etosha at around 1,500 individuals, with an additional 1,200 on private land, and the total population in Kaokoland at around 500. As of 2007, numbers in Etosha and private ranches are estimated at about 3,200 with a further 50-100 on conservancies (all stable and increasing); numbers in the north-west (the original native range) may number approximately 1,000 (J. Jackson in litt to ASG 2007). As noted by Fritz and Bourgarel (2013), actual recorded densities of Impala vary substantially, from less than 1/km² in Mkomazi National Park (Tanzania) to as many as 135/km² on the shores of Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe (Bourgarel 1998). In the wooded savanna of Akagera N.P. in Rwanda, where Monfort (1972) recorded densities of 214/km², total numbers declined by about 75-80% between 1990 and 1998 (Williams and Ntayombya 1999).",Stable,"The Impala (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>) formerly occurred widely in southern and East Africa, from central and southern Kenya and north-east Uganda to northern KwaZulu-Natal, with a small disjunct population of Black-faced Impala in north-west Namibia and south-east Angola. Their current distribution remains largely unchanged from their historical range, although it has been eliminated from parts by hunting for meat and the spread of settlement (e.g., they now only occur in south-west Uganda, and have been extirpated from Burundi) (East 1999, Fritz and Bourgarel 2013). Common Impala have been introduced to numerous privately owned game  ranches and small reserves throughout southern Africa. Impala have also  been introduced in two protected areas in Gabon, although here they are  in decline (P. Chardonnet pers. comm). In Namibia, the Black-faced Impala is naturally confined to the Kaokoland in the north-west, and neighbouring south-western Angola.","Impala are subject&#160;to consumptive purposes including hunting safaris, local use and harvesting for export. Impala are the most common antelope taken on hunting safaris in South Africa and&#160;are the second&#160;most numerous species harvested for use as biltong (after Springbok <em>Antidorcas marsupialis</em>; Van der Merwe and Saayman 2003). Owing to its high rate of reproduction and great adaptability, the Impala has also become of prime interest for meat production (e.g., Fairall 1983, Bothma 1989), not only on wildlife ranches but also in remote communal areas (e.g., Feron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998; Averbeck 2001, 2002; Bourgarel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001).

Its future is secure as long as it continues to occur in large, adequately protected and managed populations in protected areas and private farms and conservancies. The main surviving populations of the Black-faced Impala occur in Etosha National Park and private farms in Namibia. The numbers of the Black-faced Impala should continue to increase in protected areas and on private land, although it remains at potential risk from hybridization with the Common Impala (East 1999). The Namibian government has a management plan to eliminate hybridization with Common Impala and strictly regulate harvests. The Namibian Professional Hunters Association has a Black-faced Impala committee and the NGO Conservation Force has a long-term involvement in all aspects of its conservation including funding of the management plan.

There are at least an estimated 16,260 individuals (counts conducted between 2012 and 2015) on protected areas across the Free State, Gauteng, North West, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provinces (mostly within the natural distribution range). This yields a total mature population size of 9,765-11,382 (using a 60-70% mature population structure). This is an underestimate as there are many more subpopulations on wildlife ranches for which comprehensive data are unavailable. Most subpopulations in protected areas are stable or increasing. For example, there has been 7-9% annual increase in the Eastern Cape provincial protected areas over the past decade, and an average annual growth rate of 29% in the Free State provincial protected areas. Nationally, there has been an estimated population increase of 213% (2,567 to 8,063 individuals) over three generations (1992-2015) using a sample of 16 formally protected areas for which long-term data are available.<br/><br/>While grassland habitat loss remains a threat to this species, it continues to be well represented in protected areas and the expansion of wildlife ranching may be conserving additional habitat. The only major identified threat is the risk of hybridisation with Blue Wildebeest, a threat enhanced by the fenced and fragmented nature of existing subpopulations. Although it is likely that Black and Blue Wildebeest hybridised occasionally, they are naturally spatially separated through ecological specialisation. Historical habitat reduction, however, has restricted the two species to pockets of reserves and may have artificially induced hybridisation. There is worrying evidence that some formally protected subpopulations may contain hybrid individuals and further research is in progress to assess the extent of hybridisation in the population. This species will need reassessment once comprehensive data on the extent of hybridisation is produced. Currently, the hybridisation threat is being managed through implementing management practices such as separating Black and Blue Wildebeest in protected areas and through enforcing strict translocation policies. Only counting the five subpopulations that are generally accepted to be genetically pure, based on management history, the total population size may be lower than 1,000 mature individuals (currently estimated as 800-950), which would justify a Vulnerable or Near Threatened D1 listing under a precautionary purview until further analysis reveals other pure subpopulations and increases this number. However, until further data suggest otherwise, we retain the Least Concern listing as the total protected population is well above 1,000 mature individuals and is increasing. Conservation efforts should be concentrated on sustaining pure populations of Black Wildebeest in protected areas and on establishing additional pure subpopulations through a coordinated translocation program and metapopulation plan. The role of incidental and deliberate back-crossing in reducing the frequency of introgressed alleles in putative hybrid population should also be investigated. As such, this species should remain conservation dependent and retain its status as a Least Concern endemic and flagship species for our grasslands","This species is a selective short grass grazer and inhabits the open plains grasslands and karoo shrublands of South Africa and Lesotho (von Richter 1971b, 1974b; Codron and Brink 2007; Codron <em>et al</em>. 2011). The high central plateau grasslands are characterized by flat to rolling plains, and mountainous areas with altitudes ranging from 1,350-2,150 m asl (Vrahimis 2013). Open habitats are essential for the reproductive behaviour of the Black Wildebeest because territorial males require an unobstructed view of their territories in order to breed. The specialised territorial breeding behaviour of the Black Wildebeest is the reason why the Black Wildebeest is historically confined to the Highveld and Karoo areas and why it is reproductively isolated from the sympatric Blue Wildebeest. Ecological separation between the two species is incomplete although habitat heterogeneity is a key factor keeping the two wildebeest species separated (Brink 2005, 2016; Helm 2006). Given the functional meaning of Black Wildebeest horn and cranial shape (Brink 1993, 2016), the evolutionary process appears to have been linked to, or possibly caused by, a shift in mating behaviour towards permanent territoriality in males, which contrasts to Blue Wildebeest that have both territorial and non-territorial mating systems. The Black Wildebeest can be distinguished from the Blue Wildebeest by its white rather than black tail. The alternative name of these two species, “gnu”, comes from the male’s characteristic nasal call, described as “ge-nu”.<br/>:<strong><br/>Ecosystem and cultural services:</strong> The Black Wildebeest is a feisty, gregarious species that often occurs in high densities with other selective short grass grazers such as Springbok (<em>Antidorcas marsupialis</em>) and Blesbok (von Richter 1974a). Unfortunately, concentrations of these species often lead to grassland degradation and the establishment of largely homogeneous grazing lawns in higher rainfall areas and areas with a poor basal cover in lower rainfall areas. Due to this tendency, many game farmers prefer to rather keep Blue Wildebeest than Black Wildebeest in order to prevent veld deterioration. Despite its reputation as a habitat degrader, the Black Wildebeest is still considered a flagship species of the central grasslands, mainly due to their unique, spirited behaviour and endemic status.<br/><br/>A prancing Black Wildebeest appears on the South African five Rand coin and the animal has in the past been displayed on South African postage stamps (von Richter 1974a).","Historically, the main threat to this species was hunting pressure, habitat loss, and periodic outbreak of disease (Vrahimis 2013). However, now that the species has recovered and numbers are increasing, the only significant threats are hybridisation with the Blue Wildebeest, which can occur when the two species are mixed unnaturally on fenced land (East 1999, Grobler <em>et al</em>. 2011); and loss of genetic diversity from existing in isolated fenced areas, leading to isolation from the wider gene pool of the species. The effects of fragmentation and isolation may be increased by small founder population size. Both threats require a Biodiversity Management Plan and the formulation of a metapopulation strategy.<br/><br/>Black and Blue Wildebeest are two distinct species and do not interbreed naturally because they occupy different habitats (for example, Black Wildebeest cannot reproduce in habitats with extensive tree cover), although there may have historically been hybrid zones with flux in movement patterns. Fossil evidence and historical records suggest that the two species have a long history of sympatric occurrence in central southern Africa (Brink <em>et al</em>. 1999, Skead 2011). It is likely that reproductive isolation would have been in effect following the speciation of Black Wildebeest and that it remained intact until extensive habitat loss in the central interior of southern Africa (Brink 2005). This started in the early 19th century, but the skeletal evidence for hybridisation is seen only very recently, since the 1990s. This may be linked to increased levels of habitat loss and disturbance as these two species have been forced into sustained sympatry which may have led to artificial inflation of hybridisation frequency. The occurrence of Black x Blue Wildebeest hybrids (cross-breeds) was first reported in KZN in the early sixties. First generation hybrids are easily identified, but the offspring of hybrids that have interbred with pure Black Wildebeest are difficult to recognize on appearance alone. Hybrids are fertile (Fabricius <em>et al</em>. 1988, Ackermann <em>et al</em>. 2010). In several cases it appears that a disruption of the normal demographic/social structure has been involved as well. An example of this was reported for Spioenkop Nature Reserve (Langley 1995). A morphometric analysis of skeletal materials housed in the Florisbad Quaternary Research Department, which were collected from Free State provincial nature reserves over the last decade, revealed a high incidence of skull and tarsus abnormalities which might be linked to historical incidences of hybridisation (J. Brink unpubl. data). Further data is required to corroborate the extent and severity of hybridisation in formally protected areas. The threat of hybridisation, however, can be managed. As long as hybridisation is not allowed to occur on national or provincial protected areas, and the establishment of private protected areas continues to counter the loss of habitat through agriculture and mining, this species should continue to prosper.","Globally, the last estimate was a total population of more than 18,000 (with over 11,000 in its natural range and over 7,000 on farmlands in Namibia, an area outside its natural range which is not included in this assessment), of which about 80% was on private farms and conservancies and 20% in protected areas (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2008). Black Wildebeest subpopulation sex and ratio data for two Free State protected areas over a period of two years revealed average mature subpopulations of 66% and 68% (E. Schulze unpubl. data). Within the assessment region, there are an estimated 16,260 individuals (counts conducted between 2012 and 2015) on formally and privately protected areas across the Free State, Gauteng, North West, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and KZN provinces. This yields a total mature population size of 9,765-11,382 (using a 60-70% mature population structure). Additionally, there are currently (2013-2014) at least another 18,072 individuals existing on wildlife ranches across the country. This is likely to be an underestimate as not all private sector data are available.<br/><br/>In the North West Province, the subpopulations are thriving to the extent that hunting alone is no longer an effective control measure and large scale translocation and culling are required for effective population management (Power 2014). The provincial population is stable or increasing and face no severe threats (Nel 2015). There are an estimated additional 3,980 Black Wildebeest on private game farms in the province, but these farms often stock Blue and Black Wildebeest together, thereby presenting the risk of hybridisation (Power 2014). Similarly, in the Eastern Cape Province, the conservation value of both Oviston and Mpofu Nature Reserves has been undermined by exposure to <em>C. taurinus</em>, but 718 individuals from Oviston Nature Reserve have since been kept separate from the rest of the subpopulation. This highlights the need to keep Black and Blue Wildebeest separate within the natural range of Black Wildebeest and to ensure the conservation value of formally protected areas. From a genetic perspective, the <em>ex-situ</em> population of Black Wildebeest in European zoos may potentially be important, since some of these animals are descendent from animals exported in the 1950s and 1960s, and are thus representative of the genetic make-up of the species before large scale translocations started in southern Africa. For example, at present, the number of subpopulations generally considered pure based on management history is restricted to Benfontein Game Farm (Northern Cape), SA Lombard Nature Reserve (North West), Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve (Gauteng), possibly Geluk Farm (Free State), and extra-limitally in Grootte Schuur Estate (Western Cape). This yields at least 1,347 individuals in total (808–943 mature). Closer, uniform monitoring of the genetic integrity of subpopulations on all formally protected areas is in progress and the number of pure populations may rise. This species must be reassessed as soon as more data are available.<br/><br/>Overall, the population size is increasing, especially on private land. The 12 subpopulations in provincial nature reserves in the Free State Province are all increasing at an average annual growth rate of 29%, with the total number standing on 2,568 individuals in 2014 (from 2,404 individuals in 2004). Similarly, on Golden Gate Highlands National Park (which now includes QwaQwa National Park), the subpopulation has increased rapidly (from 167 to 3,267 animals between 1994 and 2016) (Bissett <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Eastern Cape Province, recent data from the provincial reserves exhibit positive growth rates: Commando Drift, Tsolwana and Oviston Nature Reserves have all exhibited 7-9% growth from 2003 to 2013. The only reserve with negative growth was Ongeluksnek, which declined by 24% after a founder population of 22 was reintroduced in 2010. In KZN, the subpopulations in Chelmsford, Coleford, Impendle, Midmar, Ntsikeni and Wagendrift Nature Reserves are all increasing or stable. Generation length for this species has been calculated as 7.8 years (Pacifici <em>et </em>al. 2013), yielding a 24-year three-generation period (1992-2015). Overall, there has been an estimated population increase of 213% (2,567 to 8,063 individuals) over three generations (1992–2015) using a sample of 16 formally protected areas for which long-term data are available.",Increasing,"The Black Wildebeest occurs in South Africa, Swaziland, and Lesotho. Essentially, the species was found in the Grassveld and Karoo regions of the central and Northern Cape, the whole of the Free State and the southern highveld regions of the former Transvaal (von Richter 1971a, 1974a). It was also recorded in western Lesotho (where they had become locally extinct through over-hunting) and the Grassveld areas of western Swaziland (Lynch 1994, Monadjem 1998) and have subsequently been reintroduced to both countries (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). In KZN, there are reports of Black Wildebeest having occurred in the open Grassveld areas below the Drakensberg range. This species attracted much attention from most early explorers in South Africa. Vivid descriptions of vast herds with animals performing curious prancing movements can be read in the diaries of these travellers. This peculiar behaviour resulted in Black Wildebeest often being called the ""clowns of the veld"". The strange appearance of the animal was apparently a cause of embarrassment for early naturalists who were confused with the classification of an animal which has ""the mane and tail of the horse; the form of the head and the horns resemble the ox; and in the legs and delicate make of the body it appears of the antelope species"" (Lichtenstein 1930).<br/><br/>By the end of the 19th century, excessive hunting had reduced the formerly vast population to a few individuals surviving on two farms in the Free State Province of South Africa (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Trade in game skins had become a flourishing business and it was reported that a single farm in Kroonstad exported 157,000 Black Wildebeest and Blesbok (<em>Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi</em>) skins in 1866 alone (Garson-Steyn and Garson-Steyn 1964). Since then, protection by farmers and conservation agencies has allowed the species to recover (East 1999, Vrahimis 2013). This achievement is a rare conservation success in Africa and can be attributed to a few conservation-minded farmers. It has now been reintroduced to parts of its former range (western Swaziland and western Lesotho) and introduced into farmland areas outside of its natural range, including Namibia (East 1999). Recently, Black Wildebeest have also been introduced to private farms in Botswana (Grobler <em>et al</em>. 2011). Within the assessment region, they have been introduced far outside of the natural range into both Limpopo (however, management agencies on protected areas are removing such extra-limital subpopulations) and Western Cape provinces. One of the subpopulations in the latter province, located on Grootte Schuur Estate, is generally considered to be a “pure” subpopulation.<br/><br/>In the past, the Blue and Black Wildebeest ranges barely overlapped (Estes and East 2009), although this may have been different in the Pleistocene (Brink <em>et al</em>. 1999). One of the known wildebeest range overlap areas was in the vicinity of the confluence of the Vaal and Orange rivers where thornveld and Karoo veld types converged. There are, however, indications that Blue and Black Wildebeest herds never utilised the same area in this region at the same time. Arguably the best example of a separation between the two wildebeest species was reported for the south-eastern Mpumalanga region in the vicinity of Amsterdam during the late 1800s. In this area Blue Wildebeest and Black Wildebeest were reportedly separated seasonally and apparently also never occurred simultaneously in that specific area (Forbes Diaries, National Archives).","The level of trade is domestic, commercial and international. The trade in live animals at game auctions, trophy hunting and culling for the venison market are the main uses of the species for economic gain. The numbers taken by trophy hunts are unlikely to have a detrimental effect on the population. Presently, with the large-scale increase in the number of game ranches being developed throughout South Africa, landowners are keeping a wider range of species on their properties, primarily to cater for local and overseas hunters. This has resulted in an increasing number of farms keeping both wildebeest species together. Wildlife ranching may also lead to bush encroachment, which may facilitate hybridisation as Black Wildebeest prefer open plains (Brink 2005). This has led to several confirmed cases of hybridisation in some provinces, and the genetic integrity of especially the Black Wildebeest is being threatened by this activity.<br/><br/>While the extensive distribution that the Blue Wildebeest has in Africa means that this species is not similarly threatened, the genetic integrity of the South African subpopulations is at risk, a threat that could seriously impact on the credibility of the local hunting industry. It goes without saying that this would also have serious economic implications for the value of both these species. In order to remedy this situation, it is of utmost importance to impose stricter translocation regulations, on a national level, to address this serious problem.",Terrestrial,"In 2008, about 20% of the population occurred in protected areas and around 80% occurred on private farmland and conservancies (East 1999). The current situation is unknown and should be reassessed through a population survey. Formally protected areas demonstrate the potential for rapid population growth of Black Wildebeest. Conservationists should focus on adequately protecting these reserves and sustaining their habitat quality. The most immediate conservation intervention necessary is separating C<em>. taurinus</em> and <em>C. gnou</em> within the natural range of <em>C. gnou</em>. This is especially important in formally protected areas, which should be maintained as source pools of genetically diverse Black Wildebeest.<br/><br/>The deliberate mixing of Blue and Black Wildebeest on any property would be a contravention of the SA National Biodiversity Act (Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act). Furthermore, it would also not be in line with the original IUCN guidelines for the reintroduction of species (IUCN SSC 2013). All provincial nature conservation agencies have taken action to avoid wildebeest hybridisation by attempting to keep the two species separate. The 2008 NEMBA (National Environmental Act) TOPS (Threatened or Protected Species) regulations, in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act 10 of 2004), prohibits the translocation of species to an extensive wildlife system where a possibility of transmitting disease or hybridisation exists. In the Free State, legislation exists for private landowners too. The Free State’s Department of Economic, Small Business Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (DESTEA) Standard Conditions on Adequate Fencing Permits policy does not allow for the live relocation of any wildebeest from an area where both species are present because of possible hybridisation concerns, unless purity is proven by means of DNA testing. Culling of hybrid subpopulations have already occurred on Maria Moroka Nature Reserve in the Free State, Spioenkop Nature Reserve in KZN and Malolotja Nature Reserve in Swaziland and on some private properties such as Laohu Valley Reserve in the south-western Free State.<br/><br/>Benfontein Game Reserve in the Northern Cape and SA Lombard Nature Reserve in the North-West Province have pure subpopulations of Black Wildebeest (established in 1954 partly to protect Transvaal’s last herds) that can re-stock potentially contaminated populations. Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve in Gauteng is also likely to contain a pure subpopulation. Groote Schuur Estate in the Western Cape also has a pure subpopulation that can be used to re-stock other reserves but this subpopulation is not counted in this assessment as it is outside the natural distribution range.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:</strong><br/>The highest priority with regards to Black Wildebeest conservation is to develop genetic markers for determining hybrid Black Wildebeest populations. This work is well advanced at the University of the Free State and the National Zoological Gardens, but consensus on parameters for purity still need to be agreed on by stakeholders. Until these markers are in general use, translocations from formally protected areas to private reserves and amongst private reserves should be continued (but not from private reserves to formally protected reserves). Standardised genetic testing and monitoring should be encouraged across all provinces and in Namibia. Live removal from areas that previously or currently house both species should be prohibited. Habitat management aimed at the preservation and maintenance of grasslands should be a priority to ensure population growth.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Research priorities:</strong><strong><br/></strong>The determination of the genetic integrity of all populations and the resulting identification of “clean” subpopulations is a priority. Ongoing research aims to achieve this, to establish robust genetic markers and thresholds for purity to detect hybrids. Once this is done and all populations have been tested (by means of a standardised procedure), the replacement of hybrid populations should commence. Therefore, priority research projects should be:<ul><li>Continued genetic studies to establish robust genetic markers to detect hybrids and develop a standardised genetic testing procedure.</li><li>Determine the genetic integrity of all Black Wildebeest populations and identify pure populations using the standardised genetic testing procedure.</li><li>Remove all hybrid populations and replace them with stock from pure populations. Also to consider the role of backcrossing in diluting the effects of hybridization.</li><li>Impacts of the establishment of this species outside it former range should be ascertained.</li></ul><strong>Encouraged citizen actions:</strong><br/><ul><li>Submit photos of Black Wildebeest showing any abnormalities to your local conservation agency.&#160;</li><li>Do not stock both Blue and Black Wildebeest on the same property.</li></ul>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Total population size has been estimated at about 300,000. About 25% of these occurred in areas with reasonably good protection and management. However, WCS surveys in southern Sudan indicate that this estimate should be increased by about 100,000. Most remaining populations are known or believed to be declining. However there is no evidence at present to show that the decline overall has reached the 20-25% level over three generations (18 years) that would justify Near Threatened status, but if declines continue it is only a matter of time before one of this threshold or a higher one is reached.","Generally an inhabitant of floodplains and other grasslands in sub-Saharan Africa. The species moved seasonally between the Sahel grasslands, savannas and the floodplains of the inner Niger Delta. In Sudan, the Tiang was widespread in savannah and floodplain grasslands, but also occurred in much lower numbers in the woodlands of the south-west. In Somalia, the Coastal Topi formerly occurred locally in the south, in riverine grasslands on the lower Shebelle and Juba Rivers and in the Lake Badana area. In South Africa, the Tsessebe formerly occurred in the bushveld and lowveld; currently, it occurs mainly on the basalt plains of northern Kruger National Park. Tsessebe do not occur in forests, arid or montane habitats (above 1,500 m) (East 1999, Duncan 2013). Nearly exclusively grazers, they can go for months without drinking in the dry season if they are feeding on growing grass (Duncan 2013).","While the species is still numerous and widespread, it has been eliminated from large areas of its former range by hunting, and habitat degradation associated with the encroachment/expansion of cattle. These threats have been most marked on the West African Korrigum; of the 12 countries in which they formerly occurred, they are now extirpated from four, and probably only occur as vagrants in three.","East (1999) gave total population estimates of 30,000 Tsessebe, 93,000 Topi, 100,000 Coastal Topi, 75,000 Tiang and 3,000 Korrigum, and a species total of about 300,000. Based on the figures available in Appendix 4 in East (1999), numbers of Bangweulu Tsessebe were in the order of 3,500. Chardonnet (2004) revised the estimate of the global population of Korrigum to 1,850-2,650 (including 800 in W-Arly-Pendjari and 800-1,600 in Waza N.P.), and estimated the number of Tiang in Central Africa at 3,200.<br/><br/>East's (1999) total for Tiang included an estimated 50,000 Tiang in South Sudan, which he acknowledged could be a gross underestimate of the actual population. Recent aerial surveys carried out by WCS in the early dry season in 2007 indicate a population exceeding 155,000 (probably an underestimate) in the Jonglei area and a generally favourable conservation situation (although numbers in Boma National Park had declined). These estimates are lower than those reported for the late dry season in 1980 (by about half), but slightly larger than those recorded in the early dry season in the same year (see Mefit-Babtie 1983).

The ranges of the subspecies are as follows (following East 1999, Duncan 2013):<br/><br/>Korrigum formerly occurred from southern Mauritania and Senegal to western Chad, but has undergone a dramatic decline since the early 1900s because of displacement by cattle and uncontrolled hunting for meat.

Total numbers are estimated at 140,000, with about 30% occurring in protected areas. Only about 25% of the population is considered stable or increasing and the rest declining. If this downward trend continues, then it is only a matter of time before the species becomes Near Threatened. Peter's Gazelle is of particular cause for concern as it has the lowest population size (&lt;15,000) and is declining, with its range inadequately covered by protected areas.","The habitat of all subpecies encompasses subdesert, lowland thorn bush, savanna woodland, open plains, and montane grassland up to 2,500 m. Grant's Gazelle inhabits open, dry plains and open savannas, including some high, cool uplands. Its habitat is typified by the plains and savannas of Serengeti National Park (Siegismund&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). Capitalizing on its water-independence, Grant's Gazelle makes a living in areas beyond the reach of herbivores that need to drink. Some even migrate to short-grass plains in the dry season and the savanna woodland during rains - opposite to the main migration. But large herds also share wet-season range and mix with the more numerous Thomson's Gazelle (Estes 1991). A large part of the range of Bright's Gazelle is very dry, but it periodically inhabits cool upland savannas and semi-deserts. In more south-eastern parts it tolerates more wooded country than the other species (Siegismund <em>et al.</em> 2013). Peter's Gazelle is essentially a lowland species and in the Tana River delta lives on very flat plains that are periodically flooded (Siegismund&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).","The species as a whole remains widespread within and outside protected areas, despite the loss of parts of its range to the expansion of agriculture and the decline of some populations because of poaching and competition with increasing numbers of livestock. It is nevertheless of concern that its numbers appear to be in decline over large parts of its range (e.g., Tsavo) and that populations which were known to be stable or increasing comprise only about 25% of the species’ total numbers (East 1999).","Recent population estimates are available for most of the species' current range, mainly from aerial surveys. Summation of these estimates gives a total of about 140,000, but this is probably an underestimate of the total numbers because of undercounting in aerial surveys and the lack of population estimates for some areas. Population trend is downward, with some exceptions such as Sibiloi and Marsabit National Parks and some of Kenya’s northern rangeland districts, Laikipia, Masai Mara National Reserve, Amboseli, Serengeti, Tarangire and Mkomazi.

This gazelle is adapted to following a nomadic annual cycle over the eastern Sudd floodplains, an ecologically distinctive region where extensive floods are followed by extreme aridity (Hashim and Kingdon 2013). During the wet season, the Mongalla Gazelle aggregates in high population densities with other migratory species such as White-eared Kob <em>Kobus kobus leucotis</em> and Tiang <em>Damaliscus lunatus tiang</em> (Hillman and Fryxell 1988).","There are no clear major threats at present. The population in the Boma ecosystem is apparently stable and not exposed to serious hunting pressure.

The overall conservation status is unlikely to change, since any further decrease in the free-living population may be compensated by the continued growth of its numbers on private farms and conservancies. The latter should continue in view of this spectacular antelope’s aesthetic appeal and its high value as a trophy animal. Nonetheless, certain subpopulations remain vulnerable, in particular that of the Giant Sable (<em>H. n. variani</em>) in Angola.","A savanna woodland species, very closely associated with the miombo <em>Brachystegia</em> woodland zone. The Sable is an “edge” species that frequents the woodland/grassland ecotone; it spends the wet season in woods open enough to support an understory of grasses no more than 30 cm high on well-drained soils, and in the dry season emerges onto the grasslands in search of green grass and forbs (Estes 2013). They are both gramivorous and folivorous, although grass makes up the bulk of their diet (Estes 2013, and references therein).","Sable have been eliminated from large areas of their former range by hunting and loss of habitat to the expansion of agricultural settlement and livestock. Poaching and armed conflict have been a major threat, specially for the Giant Sable&#160;and Sable populations in Mozambique. Further decline in the distribution and numbers of the Sable Antelope may occur in the more northerly parts of its range in future, unless the expansion of human populations and livestock is countered by the implementation of higher levels of protection and management of wildlife in countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique (East 1999).<br/><br/>A former stronghold of Sable in N Botswana, near the Caprivi border, has been severely impacted by the construction of the Northern Buffalo Fence, which has affected their access to water, causing significant mortality (Estes 2013). Inbreeding, evidenced by increased calf mortality, is a major risk in many of the smaller, privately owned herds of Sable (Grobler and Van der Bank 1994). The survival of the Giant Sable through the Angolan civil war (1975-2002) is highly encouraging, but its survival remains precarious as many Angolans who fled the Luando Reserve during the mid-1970s flood back to areas they had formerly evacuated.

The latest available estimates suggest that the population declined by 25% between 1999 and 2015, a period of 16 years (three generations = 19 years). The species is thus close to meeting the threshold for Vulnerable under criterion A2. The causes of the decline include poaching, expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing, changes in water management regimes, drought and encroachment by alien plant species.","Southern Lechwe are associated with wetlands, preferring the shallow water margins of floodplains and swamps (less than 1 m deep), although they may occasionally swim across deep-water areas. They typically frequent light woodlands and termitaria grasslands on the periphery of seasonally inundated floodplains, floodplain grasslands and water-meadows, shallow water meadows around permanently inundated swamps and lagoons, and occasionally papyrus and reed beds of deep-water swamps (Jeffery and Nefdt 2013). Southern Lechwe are grazers, feeding mainly on floodplain and aquatic grasses. Nefdt (1996) discusses an instance in which Lechwe adapted their reproductive behaviour to changes in ecology including those induced by human activities.","Southern Lechwes have been eliminated from large parts of their former range by poaching for meat. Hunting is implicated in apparent large-scale changes in the dry season distribution of Black Lechwe, with a dramatic decrease in the numbers occupying the western end of the main Bangweulu Swamps where poaching is intense. In contrast, its numbers appeared to be stable or increasing in the central section of the main swamp, and there was a steady increase in the dry season population on the 100 km² Chimbwi Plain in south-eastern Bangweulu (East 1999). Commercial hunting was also the primary reason for the dramatic decline in numbers of the Upemba Lechwe (Cotterill 2005).<br/><br/>Droughts and disruption of the natural flooding regime are significant causes of population decline. For example, water flow on the Kafue floodplain has been regulated almost entirely by human needs since the construction of hydroelectric dams at the eastern and western ends of the Flats in the 1970s. The Kafue Flats are also used for livestock grazing and the peripheral area is densely settled, particularly in the south.","Based on population estimates from aerial surveys for three of the four surviving Lechwe populations, East (1999) made corrections for under-counting biases and produced a total population estimate of 212,000: 98,000 Red Lechwe, 78,000 Kafue Lechwe and 36,000 Black Lechwe.

Assuming there are still 1,000 Upemba Lechwe (which is likely to be an overestimate), these figures suggest a total population of <em>ca </em>158,750, representing a decrease of 25% since East (1999).

This is well above the threshold of 250 mature individuals needed to qualify for Endangered but below the Vulnerable threshold under criterion D1. Even if the reintroduced population in UAE were removed from the total,  if management intensity increased, the number of mature individuals  would still be 560, more than twice the threshold for EN.  The population is stable or increasing and the area of occupancy is also increasing as Oryx are released into new sites. Although numbers in the largest population (Mahazat as Sayd in Saudi Arabia) fell between 1998 and 2008 due to drought-related mortality, they have since stabilised. <br/></p>","Arabian Oryx inhabit several desert habitats, including: barren steppes, stony plains, wadis, and sand dunes. They can survive in areas with low humidity, low rainfall, high, sandy winds, and high ambient temperatures over 45°C; and can withstand droughts up to six months.","The main threats to this species are illegal hunting, overgrazing and droughts. The Oman Arabian Oryx Sanctuary population was devastated by illegal live capture for sale to private collections and was rendered totally ineffective, with poachers removing or killing at least 200 Oryx in three years (Spalton <em>et al.</em> 1999). In fact, the site is the first ever to be deleted from UNESCO's world heritage list, based on Oman's decision to reduce the size of the protected area by 90% and to proceed with hydrocarbon prospection (UNESCO World Heritage Centre 2015). Some poaching has also been recorded in Uruq Bani Ma’arid in Saudi Arabia. Other populations in protected areas are generally safe from poaching but the security of animals that wander outside release sites cannot be guaranteed, except perhaps in Israel. Drought and overgrazing have reduced habitat quality in places and limited the choice of potential release sites.&#160;Prolonged drought in west-central Saudi Arabia resulted in the death of  560 Oryx in the fenced Mahazt as Sayd reserve, 1999-2008 (Islam <em>et al. </em> 2010, 2011).","Estimates provided at the 17th International Conservation Workshop for Arabian Biodiversity (Sharjah, UAE, February 2016) for populations that qualify as 'wild'&#160; under the Red List Guidelines were: Oman (<em>ca </em>10); Saudi Arabia (<em>ca </em>500 in Mahazat as Sayd and 100 in Uruq Bani Ma’arid); Israel (<em>ca </em>110); UAE 410 (Umm al Zumoul), Jordan (<em>ca </em>80 in Wadi Rum). There is an ongoing debate over the degree of management intervention of  many of these reintroduced populations, most of which are in fenced sites. The 'wild' total is thus 1,220 (<em>ca </em>850 mature individuals). Overall reintroduced populations are stable or increasing slowly.<br/><br/>An estimated 6,000-7,000 animals are held in captivity worldwide, most  of them on the Arabian Peninsula. Some of these are maintained in large  fenced enclosures, receiving various amounts of supplemental food and  care, including those in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and UAE.<br/><br/>The reintroduced population in Oman reached a high point of 450 in 1994 when illegal live capture began and severely reduced numbers (Spalton <em>et al.</em> 1999). Many of the released animals were taken back into captivity for security.",Stable,"<p>The Arabian Oryx formerly occurred through most of the Arabian Peninsula, north to Kuwait and Iraq. The species' range had already contracted by the early years of the 20th century and the decline accelerated thereafter. Before 1920, Oryx distribution was separated into areas over 1,000 km apart: a northern population in and around the Nafud, and a larger southern population in the Rub Al Khali and the plains of central-southern Oman. Oryx disappeared from the north in the 1950s. In the south, their range steadily decreased due to hunting, and by the 1960s Oryx were restricted to parts of central and southern Oman. The last wild individuals were probably shot in 1972 on the Jiddat al Harasis.<br/> <br/> Arabian Oryx have been reintroduced to Oman (Arabian Oryx Sanctuary, from 1982); Saudi Arabia (Mahazat as-Sayd Reserve, 2,244 km² from 1990; Uruq Bani Ma’arid Reserve, 12,000 km² from 1995); Israel (three sites in the Northern Arava and Negev Desert, from 1997); and United Arab Emirates (Arabian Oryx Reserve, Abu Dhabi, from 2007), and Jordan (Wadi Rum, from 2014).<br/></p>    <p>There is a small introduced population on Hawar Island, Bahrain and large semi-managed populations at several sites in Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia. </p>",This species is hunted illegally for sport and food and in the recent past there has been some illegal trade for private collections.,Terrestrial,"Protective legislation in all countries with reintroduced populations is adequate.

If current trends continue, some of the Oribi’s marginal populations (and possible subspecies) may face eventual extinction. However, the species’ overall conservation status should remain satisfactory as long as it continues to exist in healthy, stable populations in a large number of protected areas and hunting zones and in some other areas with low densities of settlement.","Oribi inhabit savanna woodlands, floodplains and other open grasslands, from around sea level to about 2,000 m asl. They reach their highest density on floodplains and moist tropical grasslands, especially in association with large grazers.","It has been eliminated from substantial parts of its former range by the spread of agricultural settlement, livestock and increased hunting for meat. In the Comoé N.P. in Côte d’Ivoire, Oribi experienced a decline of around 92% between 1978 and 1998 primarily due to poaching (Fischer and Linsenmair 2001). It nevertheless shows considerable resilience to hunting in some parts of its range, although generally not to the extent of highly resilient species such as Bushbuck and Grey Duiker. Its populations are becoming increasingly fragmented as it is gradually eliminated from moderately to densely settled areas (Brashares and Arces 2013).","Oribi are locally common in suitable habitats at densities of 2-10 animals/km², but have been recorded at densities up to 45 animals/km² in exceptionally productive tropical grasslands and treeless floodplains (Brashares and Arcese 2013, and references therein). Densities estimated from ground counts range from 0.1-0.4/km² in areas where it is uncommon or depleted (East 1999).<br/><br/>East (1999) produced a total population estimate of 750,000. Population trend is stable in many protected areas but decreasing in some others which receive minimal or no protection. Outside protected areas, population trend is gradually downwards in many parts of the Oribi’s range as human populations increase and settlement expands, although its populations are stable in some thinly settled, unprotected regions where hunting pressures are relatively low.",Decreasing,"The Oribi has a patchy distribution ranging from Senegal to Ethiopia and Eritrea and south through eastern Africa to Angola and the Eastern Cape of South Africa (East 1999, Brashares and Arcese 2013).

50192715,16484,Pelea capreolus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2017,2016-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is endemic to the South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland occurring in rocky grassland habitats. Although assumed to be unthreatened due to its inaccessible habitat, collation of available subpopulation data reveals an estimated decline of <em>ca</em> 20% over three generations (1999–2014) in 13 formally protected areas across its range. Most concerning of these is an estimated decline of 15-20% in one of the largest protected subpopulations, Maloti-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site. Corroborating the empirical data are anecdotal reports of declines or local extinctions in North West, Western Cape, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga provinces, as well as the Lesotho Highlands. No Grey Rhebok have been recorded in North West protected areas or in Ohirgstad Dam Nature Reserve (Mpumalanga Province) since 2013. We thus list this species as Near Threatened, close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd, under a precautionary purview, due to an estimated continuing decline and increased levels of hunting. Further long-term data are needed to improve the accuracy of the population reduction estimate, as subpopulations are suspected to be faring poorly outside of protected areas too. This species should be reassessed as further reliable data become available as it may qualify for a more threatened listing. Strongholds for Grey Rhebok are Maloti-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site and Golden Gate Highlands National Park, both with subpopulations of &gt;400 individuals. Reasons for the decline are poorly understood but may be due to increases in illegal sport hunting with dogs, bushmeat poaching, incidental snaring and the emerging threat of inflated predation rates. Long-term monitoring sites should be established to quantify subpopulation trends and threat severity.","Grey Rhebok are associated with rocky hills, grassy mountain slopes, and plateau grasslands in the eastern extent of their distribution. In the south and southwest, their distribution is associated with the rocky hills of mountain fynbos and the little Karoo. They are predominantly browsers, often feeding on ground-hugging forbs, and largely water independent, obtaining most of their water requirements from their food (Avenant 2013). Forbs constitute the majority of their diet, especially the flowers and leaves of the plants (Esser 1973, Rowe-Rowe 1983a, Beukes 1988). They require good grass cover within their home ranges for shelter and to hide from predators, but often use steep open areas with little cover when feeding. In the Western Cape, they are often observed on agricultural lands (Radloff 2008, C. Birss pers. obs. 2016). For example, there is seasonal movement between Bontebok National Park and surrounding agricultural lands (C. Cowell unpubl. data). Similarly, in the southern Drakensberg, Grey Rhebok move over large areas that encompass protected areas and adjacent farmlands (O’Connor and Krüger 2003).<br/><br/>Home range size is estimated at 30-100 ha in the eastern Free State mountain grasslands (Taylor <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). The social system of Grey Rhebok is female defence polygyny, with males aggressively defending a harem of 2-7 females plus accompanying young in a stable herd (Taylor and Skinner 2006). This harem system of females remaining permanently with a single territorial male for long periods is very unusual amongst antelope species. Non-territorial males generally remain solitary. This behaviour may exacerbate an Allee effect in this species (whereby there is a decline in individual fitness at low population size or density) since family groups are closed to outsiders and male offspring disperse as yearlings and remain peripheral until they gain a territory, but further research is required to investigate this.<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem and cultural services:</strong> Grey Rhebok are an important foraging species in hilly areas. In many small protected areas, or those close to urban areas, Grey Rhebok are the largest browsing ungulate that can be stocked, thus performing a pivotal role in the ecosystem. The Dutch spelling of the species, reebock, gave its name to the sport brand Reebok. The name “roebuck” appears often in early records of settlers in the Cape (South Africa); this animal probably reminded these settlers very much of the European Roebuck (Roe Deer, <em>Capreolus capreolus</em>). The pronunciation and spelling over the years have changed through Roe, Rabock, Reebok, Raybuck to Rhebok in English and “Ribbok” in Afrikaans (Skead 2011).","While the threats to Grey Rhebok and their severity require more research, the primary threat is suspected to be increased levels of bushmeat and illegal sport hunting with dogs (Avenant 2013, Avenant <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, du Plessis <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). In KwaZulu-Natal alone, a recent survey of 92 people in rural settlements in the Wartburg, Estcourt and Creighton areas found that 82% of respondents hunt illegally (42% for meat and 46% hunted with dogs) on a regular basis, with 51% hunting every week (Grey-Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). While Grey Rhebok was not explicitly mentioned as a target, we infer such hunting to affect this species. Protected areas close to urban areas exhibit increased predation by illegal sport hunting with packs of dogs and also feral dogs, such as in Bontebok National Park where recently eight Grey Rhebok were killed by dogs (C. Cowell unpubl. data). Similarly, the Cape Leopard Trust has raised serious concerns about the general decline of prey species and suspect that, due to the proximity of the Boland Mountains to the urban areas and expanding informal settlements, that the smaller antelope are targeted by snaring and hunted with dogs for bushmeat (C. Birss pers. comm. 2016). In Coleford Nature Reserve in the southern Drakensberg, where the Grey Rhebok subpopulation declined between 1986 and 2001, 79 dogs were removed from 1985–2002 and 96 snares were removed during 1990/91 alone (O’Connor and Krüger 2003). An initial subpopulation spike was coincident with the first removal of dogs from the reserve, which was probably symptomatic of escalated dog hunting in the adjacent properties and thus Grey Rhebok moving into Coleford Nature Reserve (O’Connor and Krüger 2003). In the Northern Cape, illegal hunting of Grey Rhebok by communal farmers is also a problem (C. Kraft pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Local declines are also suspected from increased densities of natural predators (Avenant 2013). Anecdotal reports from the Free State and Northern Cape suggest that an emerging threat is increased predation levels from higher abundances of mesopredators, especially Black-backed Jackal (<em>Canis mesomelas</em>) (Rowe-Rowe 1983b, C. Kraft and N. Avenant pers. obs. 2015), Caracals (<em>Caracal caracal</em>) (Palmer and Fairall 1988) and perhaps Leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) in the arid areas (C. Kraft pers. comm. 2016). Poor carnivore management may be responsible for increased mesopredator abundance (Minnie <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation may also play a role, such as climate-change or land-use induced bush encroachment (Hudak and Wessman 2001, Wigley <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009) in areas such as the North West and Limpopo (Power 2014). There is no evidence for disease as a threat (Taylor <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), but Grey Rhebok may occasionally be affected by parasite infestation (Beukes 1988).<br/><br/>It is likely that several threats synergise to cause subpopulation decline. For example, in Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve, Free State, the reasons behind declines are the observed increase in poaching (mainly hunting with dogs), increased predation rates due to the closure of the local vulture restaurant, and possibly habitat degradation related to increased frequency of fires (E. Schulze unpubl. data).","While East (1999) suggested a total population of about 18,000, at least 25% occurring in protected areas and more than 30% on private land, the lack of comprehensive data prevents an accurate estimate of current population size. The remaining proportion of the population, which is in decline, is made up of scattered populations on the peripheries of protected areas in South Africa, as well as remnant populations in Lesotho and Swaziland. There is estimated to be a minimum of 2,000 individuals in formally protected areas, but further research is needed to determine whether there are over 10,000 individuals across its range. The largest known subpopulations occur in the Maloti-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site, where numbers were estimated to be 2,000-3,000 in 1994 (Rowe-Rowe 1994), but which are thought to have declined by at least 15-20% (and possibly more) over the last 15 years (1999–2015; I. Rushworth pers. comm. 2016); and Golden Gate Highlands National Park, where a recent aerial survey counted 414 individuals at 1.3 animals / km² (Bissett <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Estimated population densities of the Grey Rhebok in protected areas are generally in the range 0.5-1.7 animals / km² (IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2008), but occasionally lower, for example, 0.2-0.3 animals / km² in Addo-Zuurberg and Karoo National Parks; or higher, for example, 4.3 animals / km² in Bontebok National Park (Beukes 1987); or 6.4 animals / km² at Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve (summarised in East 1999, Taylor <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). The Grey Rhebok subpopulation in the Coleford Nature Reserve (southern Drakensberg) varies greatly in size due to their utilisation of adjacent lands. An increase in subpopulation size was described between 1986 and 1988 with 27 individuals in the 1,272 ha reserve, probably due to compression of subpopulations from adjoining properties as a result of an increase in hunting by dogs. This increase was followed by a decrease until 1993, likely due to poaching and a succession of long, dry winters (O’Connor and Krüger 2003). Between 1993 and 2001, the mean subpopulation size in the reserve was 7.6 individuals (O’Connor and Krüger 2003).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species has been calculated as 4.9 years (based on a longevity of 12 years in captivity) (Pacifici <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), which yields a 14.7 year three generation period (1999-2014). The IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimate generation length as 4.4 years, yielding a 13 year three generation window (D. Mallon pers. comm. 2016). The Grey Rhebok is a difficult species to count accurately, and inconsistent counting methods in many areas have resulted in a paucity of reliable trend data on which to base an assessment. Collation of available subpopulation data from 13 formally protected areas across its range with adequate long-term count data suggests a decline of 17-25% over three generations. Additionally, anecdotal evidence in other protected areas confirms a generally declining trend. In the Northern Cape there are no reliable population trend data, but numbers are suspected to be declining primarily due to poaching (K. Craft pers. comm. 2016). In the Western Cape (where trend data are also lacking) there are similar reports of declining subpopulations across national and provincial protected areas, private lands and the Boland Mountain Complex (T. Barry pers. comm. 2016, C. Birss and C. Cowell unpubl. data). Additionally, only two individuals were counted in Table Mountain National Park in 2011 (C. Cowell unpubl. data), and Grey Rhebok are absent from a number of private farms in the Western Cape where their occurrence would be expected. Conversely, the subpopulation in Golden Gate Highlands National Park appears to be genuinely increasing (Bissett <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). However, counts of the Golden Gate Highlands National Park are excluded because the count methods have changed significantly over the three generation period and the park has increased in size, rendering comparisons between 1999 and 2016 spurious (C. Bissett pers. comm. 2016). Further collation of long-term data, especially outside protected areas, is necessary to more accurately estimate population reduction over three generations. Overall, while the decline is <em>ca</em> 20% from a sample of protected areas, the net decline may be greater, as subpopulations may be declining more severely outside protected areas. As the Near Threatened category (for criterion A) is based on declines that are close to meeting the criterion A threshold of 30% (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), we thus feel a precautionary listing is appropriate.<br/><br/>The level of fragmentation is unknown. While the distribution of Grey Rhebok is discontinuous and patchy, they occur outside of protected areas and will be able to move fairly freely in many areas. They are also accomplished leapers known to jump fences (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). There is natural geographic fragmentation by mountain ranges and fragmentation caused by agricultural land uses. Grey Rhebok are quite widespread and free-roaming, and although the number of locations is unknown, they are unlikely to be affected by any single threat. That being said, given the declines in numbers across the country, the level of fragmentation may be increasing.",Decreasing,"Grey Rhebok are endemic to South Africa, Lesotho and parts of Swaziland (although they formerly occurred widely in the western regions), existing patchily in areas of suitable habitat. They may marginally occur in southwestern Namibia (Irish 2016), but this remains to be validated. Although believed to have occurred in hilly country around Gaborone in south-east Botswana (Skinner and Chimimba 2005), they no longer occur there (Smithers 1971). Similarly, while no formal records are available, they once occurred throughout Lesotho as the “only bovid found in reasonable numbers” (Lynch 1994 p. 212), but now probably only exist in a few scattered subpopulations (Avenant 2013).<br/><br/>Generally, Grey Rhebok still occur throughout much of their historical range in both protected areas and private lands (Skinner and Chimimba 2005), but agricultural transformation and human settlement expansion may have reduced occupancy. While there is doubt that they historically occurred on Table Mountain, they are accepted to have occurred in the Cape Peninsula and the mountains near Stellenbosch (Skinner and Chimimba 2005, Radloff 2008, Skead 2011). While they are fairly common in the Karoo and fynbos regions (for example, Anysberg Nature Reserve; M. Drouilly unpubl. data), they no longer occur north of the Orange River in the Northern Cape, or in parts of the North West Province. Indeed, a recent province-wide survey in North West did not find any Grey Rhebok in protected areas (Nel 2015). They may have historically occurred in the Kgaswane and Rustenberg areas (Kettlitz 1962, Bigalke 1968, Rautenbach 1978), and may still persist in the Magaliesberg and Waterberg (although surveys are required to confirm this) (Power 2014). Despite its supposedly widespread occurrence in the eastern part of the province (see Friedmann and Daly 2004), reported subpopulations from private landowners could not be ground-truthed (Power 2014). Confusion with Mountain Reedbuck (<em>Redunca fulvorufula</em>) may explain the difficulty in confirming its presence (Lloyd and Millar 1983, Power 2014). In Limpopo they may occur in the Waterberg and the northern escarpment (for example, the Wolkberg Mountains). In the Northern Cape, this species only naturally occurs within the Namaqualand District but is rarely observed (K. Craft pers. comm. 2016). Recently, however, it has been positively identified in Nababiep Nature Reserve, situated 140 km north of Springbok (Pienaar 2010), which indicates that they still occur in the Succulent Karoo Biome and on private lands.<br/><br/>Although its area of occupancy has not been calculated for protected areas, this species also occurs outside protected areas on private land in a number of provinces, so its occupancy is likely to be higher than the minimum for the Vulnerable category (2,000 km²).","They are used on a commercial basis for trophy hunting, both locally and internationally, with prices between $900 and $1,400 for the trophy itself (M. Drouilly unpubl. data, Department of Environmental Affairs, trophy hunting statistics). Roughly 100 individuals are trophy hunted every year. Although Grey Rhebok are occasionally hunted by domestic hunters, they do not appear to be a popular species for game meat. All legal hunting activities should theoretically be based on sustainable use principles, so should not negatively impact on populations. However, this should be monitored. They are also increasingly used on a subsistence basis by local communities as bushmeat, or recreationally as part of sport hunting with dogs (O’Connor and Krüger 2003, Grey-Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010). There is also commercial value in live animal sales and translocating animals between game farms and protected areas, but translocations should not mix ecotypes.",Terrestrial,"Grey Rhebok are reported to occur in many provincial reserves and national parks in the assessment region, with two strongholds in the Maloti-Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site and Golden Gate Highlands National Park. The primary intervention at this stage is to investigate the causes of the decline and to then outline appropriate interventions. Adaptive management of formally protected areas is recommended to trial strategies that are effective in stabilising or increasing subpopulations. For example, while Grey Rhebok were previously threatened by unplanned fires, poaching and livestock overgrazing in QwaQwa National Park, its amalgamation with Golden Gate Highlands National Park in 2008 saw the subpopulation increase from 150 in 2003 to 269 in 2016 (Schulze 2016), with 414 animals overall in the combined area in 2016 (Bissett <em>et al.</em> 2016). This positive growth is attributed to improved fences and fence maintenance, decreased poaching and livestock overgrazing (following land restitution settlement), and habitat improvement due to better fire management and vegetation rehabilitation (Schulze 2016). Such interventions could be trialled in other protected areas and private lands. In Seekoeivlei Nature Reserve, Free State, the subpopulation is stable or increasing due it being fairly secure from poaching as well as the relatively high abundance of other prey species, in this case waterbirds (E. Schulze unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The most important immediate intervention is to combat illegal dog hunting through enforcement in affected areas and education/awareness campaigns in local communities to encourage alternative forms of recreations. Programmes to remove or control feral dogs should also be implemented. Private landowners should be encouraged to continue to form conservancies to reduce the edge effects of small areas of natural habitat, such that vulnerability to poaching is lessened. The maintenance of indigenous grassland through livestock ranching under private tenure is particularly important around small reserves that are too small to maintain Grey Rhebok subpopulations (O’Connor and Krüger 2003).<br/><br/>The effects of translocations and reintroduction success should also be monitored, especially in the case of translocating adult males. Given the highly aggressive nature of territorial males towards foreign males, it is hard for new males to establish themselves if pre-existing territories are present. Vegetation types such as the Waterberg-Magaliesberg Mountain Sourveld (Mucina and Rutherford 2006) are suitable for this species, and reintroduction should be considered in, for example, Kgaswane Nature Reserve, North West, to restore former antelope diversity and to gather information on the causes on subpopulation persistence or decline (Power 2014).

50193334,19306,Raphicerus melanotis,Least Concern,,2017,2016-12-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is listed as Least Concern. Despite its restricted range, the Cape Grysbok is common, relatively adaptable, and there are no major threats that could cause range-wide declines. This species is well represented in protected areas and occurs on private farms where it can typically adapt to the predominant forms of land use provided that there is sufficient suitable structured habitat remaining. However estimates of population sizes are scarce and it is therefore difficult to extrapolate data from individual studies or locations to discern the status of the population nationally. Some studies are also relatively dated thus highlighting the need for more robust estimates of Cape Grysbok populations from sites throughout their distribution. The population trend is assumed to be generally stable in protected areas and on private land, but decreasing in some other areas where human population densities are high. The effects of private conservation and wildlife ranching on this species should further be monitored and managed. There is also little information on the possible impacts of climate change, alien invasive vegetation and the expansion of certain agricultural industries in some areas (e.g., rooibos tea plantations and vineyards). However, climate change may make marginal habitats more suitable for agricultural expansion, putting pressure on remaining habitat patches where this species occurs, and thus represents an emerging threat. This should be monitored for its impacts on Cape Grysbok.","The natural (historical) distribution of Cape Grysbok is primarily associated with the Fynbos Biome and extends into the Forest, Succulent Thicket and Succulent Karoo Biomes and marginally into the Nama-Karoo and Grassland Biomes. They are absent from the Desert and Savanna Biomes. They are locally common in thickets, shrublands and the fynbos habitats. Dense cover is an important habitat requirement. Their presence in the high-altitude grasslands of the north-eastern Cape is conditional on the proximity of forest fragments and bush clumps, although they may also use long grass for cover (Castley and Lloyd 2013). They also enter developed areas such as vineyards and agricultural areas (East 1999), and have been blamed, along with the Common Duiker, for extensive damage to young shoots in tea plantations in the Cedarberg (C.T. Stuart and T. Stuart pers. comm. in Castley and Lloyd 2013). This only happens where there is suitable habitat in close proximity. Cape Grysbok are generally regarded as browsers (Stynder 2009). The inclusion of grass in the diet has also been reported (Manson 1974) but has been regarded as unimportant (Skinner and Chimimba 2005), but its importance may fluctuate with environmental changes (Faith 2011). More recently, however, some studies have shown that the Cape Grysbok is a highly selective browser (Kigozi <em>et al</em>. 2008, Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2010). Furthermore, Kerley <em>et al</em>. (2010) reported significant selection for grasses in their study. This is an adaptable species and can survive in human-modified landscapes provided that vegetation with the required understorey cover remains.","There are no major threats to the species, although the increase in agriculture and human settlements have reduced available habitat. Localised declines occur due to habitat transformation and loss of dense vegetation in some areas. For example, Cape Grysbok ranges have seen local declines in numbers from areas such as the AENP where escalating numbers of elephants have opened up or destroyed thicket habitats (Castley and Lloyd 2013, Tambling <em>et al.</em> 2013). Additionally, some game farms are over stocked and under managed resulting in the opening up of areas of dense vegetation, thus reducing habitat for Cape Grysbok. Even where numbers are not excessive, extra-limital browsers can compete for forage and space (Spear and Chown 2009, Spear <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Cape Grysbok are illegally hunted with dogs, which may lead to local subpopulation declines. They are also both accidentally and deliberately caught with snares for bush meat. Localised unsustainable offtakes of trophy males for hunting may lead to population structure disruptions and localised declines.<br/><br/>Additionally, the habitat available to this species is declining in area and quality. Agriculture and urbanisation has reduced habitat, but there has not been a severe decrease in habitat quality. For example, Pence (2014) calculated that between 2006 and 2011, 536 km² of land was converted to agriculture in the Western Cape Province (107 km² per year, which equates to 0.08% of the surface area of the province per year). Urban human settlements have expanded by 8.6% and 6.3% between 2000 and 2013 in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, respectively (GeoTerraImage 2015), which we infer to mean increasing mortality from poaching, snaring and dog hunting. Even though there may not be any empirical evidence for specific impacts of extra-limital species on Cape Grysbok, several publications have highlighted the detrimental impacts of introducing extra-limital and/or exotic species that compete for resources with an endemic species (Castley <em>et al.</em> 2001, Spear and Chown 2009, Spear <em>et al.</em> 2011). Observational data from AENP further indicate that the increase in numbers of larger herbivores is associated with declines in the more cryptic species (for example, Grysbok and Bushpig). Finally, we suspect that habitat loss from agricultural expansion may become likely as climate change makes marginal habitats more suitable for cultivation. For example, climate change is projected to increase the suitability of upslope habitats for viticulture, increasing the footprint of winelands by 14% by 2050 (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Cape Grysbok are normally solitary and cryptic in their behaviour and therefore seldom seen. They are particularly difficult to see in dense vegetation, which is exacerbated in fire-prone areas such as the fynbos of the Western Cape (Castley and Lloyd 2013). Estimates of population sizes are scarce and it is therefore difficult to extrapolate data from individual studies or locations to discern the status of the population nationally. Some studies are also relatively dated and more recent data are needed. For example, Scott (1991) studied the distribution of small antelopes in De Hoop Nature Reserve between 1985 and 1987 and recorded densities of 0.21 animals / 100 km travelled for Cape Grysbok compared with 2.64 for Steenbok (<em>Raphicerus campestris</em>). Castley and Lloyd (2013) suggest that comparisons such as this may not be accurately accurate estimates of Cape Grysbok populations given their relative lack visibility and dense habitat preferences. Once again this highlights the need for more robust estimates of Cape Grysbok subpopulations from sites throughout their distribution. All indications are however that Cape Grysbok occur “freely” in the landscape—on and off protected areas, on agricultural land, on game farms, and in vineyards.<br/><br/>Based on available habitat, and a requirement of between 6 and 456 ha per animal depending on the vegetation type, Cape Grysbok numbers could be up to 231,448 in the Cape Floristic Region, down from an estimated population of 322,977 in the pre-habitat transformation model (Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2003). This modelled estimate is almost an order of magnitude higher than earlier estimates (East 1999). Current data from CapeNature indicate that Cape Grysbok occur on 58 provincial protected areas, with a total estimated abundance of 1,196 individuals. Using the number of land parcels (2,438) on which Cape Grysbok are either present (720 land parcels) or persist (indicating that the subpopulation is persistent and breeding; 1,718 land parcels) in the Western Cape Province, at the calculated densities of 6 to 456 hectares per animal it is estimated that the 77,269 ha of protected area could sustain between 1,704 to 129,544 animals. In the City of Cape Town area, Cape Grysbok occur in high densities on some relatively small (less than 100 ha) isolated properties, such as False Bay Nature Reserve, Zandvlei, University of the Western Cape and Millerton Race Course. The reduced predation from dogs and natural predators and the lack of competition from Common Duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) are possible reasons for these elevated densities (C. Dorse pers. comm. 2015). Cape Grysbok are present in Table Mountain National Park (D. Winterton pers. comm. 2015), West Coast National Park (Avery 1990), Bontebok National Park (Novellie <em>et al</em>. 1994), Agulhas National Park (M. Raselabe pers. comm. 2016), Garden Route National Park (L. Moolman-van der Vyver pers. comm. 2016), Baviaanskloof and Groendal Nature Reserve (D. Peinke unpubl. data), and Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) but are absent from Namaqua and Tankwa Karoo National Parks. This is according to the Mammals Tool that the Cape Research Centre produced in 2011, based on putative distribution maps (Skinner and Chimimba 2005), as well as the references mentioned above.<br/><br/>No comprehensive subpopulation trend data are available but the population is suspected to be stable (for example, aerial counts suggest a stable subpopulation on Baviaanskloof Nature Reserve between 2008 and 2014; D. Peinke unpubl. data), although there are indications of localised declines. Anecdotal evidence suggest that numbers of Cape Grysbok and Bushpig (<em>Potamochoerus larvatus</em>) both declined in the Main Camp section of AENP as mega-herbivore numbers increased (Tambling <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, G. Castley unpubl. data) and no evidence could be found of their presence there in 2014/2015 (G. Kerley unpubl. data).",Stable,"The Cape Grysbok is endemic to South Africa, and is largely confined to the Cape Floristic Region. It remains widespread and locally common within its historical range in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. It also marginally occurs in the Northern Cape. The most northern confirmed record and locality is van Rhynsdorp, Western Cape Province (Skead 2011). In the Eastern Cape, little is known about its historical distribution (Skead 2007). Boshoff and Kerley (2013) provide two records for the Drakensberg/Lesotho but caution that they may be of material transported there through trade. The range has not expanded either naturally or through the private sector. If anything it has contracted through the loss of scattered habitat fragments that have been structurally altered (become less dense), or have been totally transformed through the introduction and expansion of alien invasive vegetation (Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2010), increased densities of megaherbivores (Tambling <em>et al</em>. 2013) and the expansion of certain agricultural industries in some areas (for example, rooibos tea plantations and vineyards). This trend is likely to continue with the effects of climate change making such fragments amenable to alternative land uses. In the Western Cape, the area of occupancy (AOO) calculated for properties for which Cape Grysbok presence is confirmed is 9,104 km², of which 5,451 km² is in provincial nature reserves, 1.8 km² in local authority nature reserves, 2,319 km² in national parks and 1,331 km² on private land (C. Birss unpubl. data). For more detailed discussion of the distribution range see East (1999) and Castley and Lloyd (2013).","This species is poached as bushmeat, as they are vulnerable to being caught in snares, but this is not expected to cause widespread population decline. There is also limited international trophy hunting from hunters targeting the “tiny 10”. Cape Grysbok parts have also been recorded from traditional herbalist shops but at relatively low frequencies (number of items for sale) and rates of occurrence (number of outlets where items are for sale) (Simelane and Kerley 1998). CapeNature aims to manage off-takes through permits and requests that land owners provide evidence of the persistence of their subpopulations and registers of hunting history. Captive breeding is discouraged by CapeNature and the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency, and local translocations from within the ecotypic range are preferred. Landowners are required to supply evidence of the status of their population before permits to capture and translocate are supplied. The receiving property is also evaluated for suitability of habitat.",Terrestrial,"Cape Grysbok are conserved in protected areas throughout their natural distribution range in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces. In the Western Cape, the protected areas in which Cape Grysbok occurs, comprise ca 9,104 km², of which 5,451 km² is provincial nature reserves, 1.8 km² is local authority nature reserves, and 2,319 km² is national parks (C. Birss unpubl. data). Regulated harvesting through conservation legislation aims to ensure that off-takes are sustainable. In addition, it occurs widely in local authority and forestry reserves and on private land (East 1999). Research is being initiated by CapeNature and the Cape Leopard Trust to investigate the impacts of bush meat poaching in natural areas where Cape Grysbok occurs in close proximity to highly populated urban areas.While no direct conservation interventions are necessary at present, several interventions will benefit this and other species in the region:<br/><ol><li>Continue with biodiversity stewardship schemes to protect patches of remaining habitat, thus enabling better connectivity across the landscape for this species and enabling range shifts in adaptation to climate change. <br/></li><li>Allow habitats to recover and interspecific competition to decrease by reducing stocking rate, especially of exotic species. Awareness and training programmes should be provided to landowners in key habitat areas. Provincial conservation authorities should also systematically monitor trophy hunting and translocation activities to gauge the sustainability of the practice and gather information for a Biodiversity Management Plan for Cape Grysbok.</li><li>Increased enforcement of laws protecting wildlife should be used to discourage illegal poaching. Linked to this is the substitution of sport hunting with dogs with alternative recreational opportunities.</li></ol>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The population trend is generally stable or increasing in protected areas and on private land (though it varies from decreasing to increasing elsewhere). Numbers may be declining in some unprotected areas where settlement densities and hunting pressures are high.","Steenbok occupy a variety of habitats, from semi-desert to alpine moorland zones up to altitudes of 3,500 m on Mt Kenya (du Toit 2013). They occur widely in drier savannas, grasslands and scrublands (East 1999). In southern Africa they show a particular preference for heavily grazed areas, where the herb layer has a high forb to grass ratio and the woody layer is dominated by encroaching thorn scrub; such conditions often occur around watering points although Steenbok are largely water-independent. The key habitat requirement is the availability of high-quality food items (green browse, geophytes, berries, flowers or pods) throughout the year (du Toit 2013).","There are no major threats to this species. However, Steenbok are locally vulnerable to predation by domestic dogs and subsistence herdsmen who frequently capture and kill juveniles in particular (when they are found lying alone in cover) (du Toit 2013).","East (1999) estimated a total population size in excess of 600,000 individuals, but this is an underestimate. Aerial surveys underestimate population numbers, but ground surveys, in areas where the species is common, give density estimates of 0.3-1.0/km² (East 1999). In general, there are no reliable estimates of Steenbok population density, as census methods are too unreliable for this cryptic species (du Toit 2013).",Stable,"Steenbok have a disjunct distribution, with one population in East Africa (southern Kenya, north and central Tanzania) and a larger one in southern Africa, the isolating barrier being the tall miombo woodlands of central Zambia, Malawi (from which there are no records) and northern Mozambique (du Toit 2013). In southern Africa, their range extends from southern Angola and western Zambia, into most of Namibia (except the arid coastal parts), throughout Botswana, much of Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, and much of South Africa (being absent only from southern and south-eastern KwaZulu-Natal and the neighbouring Eastern Cape) (du Toit 2013).

Population trends were generally stable in protected areas (60%), increasing on private land (13%), and decreasing elsewhere (27%). There is no evidence to show that the species is currently close to meeting the criteria for threatened or for Near Threatened status. The Southern Reedbuck’s overall status should remain unchanged as long as it continues to be well represented in protected areas and on private farms and conservancies, though some peripheral populations may face an more uncertain future (e.g., in Gabon, southern Congo, DRC).","Southern Reedbucks occupy floodplain and drainage-line grasslands in savanna woodlands. The most significant habitats in South Africa are valleys in which the grass cover is tall (or there is suitable herbaceous cover) and permanent water is available and they prefer grass islands and avoid woody vegetation (Jungius 1971). Southern Reedbucks range to 1,800-2,000 m in the Drakensberg mountains of South Africa (Rowe-Rowe 1994). They are predominantly fresh grass grazers, but will occasionally take small quantities of herbs, and in some areas may even browse extensively (Jungius 1971). The species overlaps with Bohor Reedbuck in southern Tanzania.",The Southern Reedbuck is particularly susceptible to hunting because it  is slow and of a convenient size to be hunted by dogs and carried by a  single or very few hunters (Jungius 1971). It also prefers well-watered  habitats that are attractive to agricultural settlement; declines and  extirpations have been documented over many parts of southern Africa and  it has been extripated over much of its original range (Kingdon and  Hoffmann 2013; and references therein).,"Aerial counts of the Southern Reedbuck tend to result in density estimates of 0.1-0.2/km², or less than 0.1/km² but produced estimates of up to 1.9/km²&#160;in Nyika National Park (Malawi), where the species is exceptionally abundant, but aerial surveys undoubtedly tend to underestimate its true numbers, and the species can occur at densities up to 35/km<sup>2</sup> in exceptionally favourable habitat (East 1999). The total population size was estimated at 73,000 individuals based on average densities of 0.3/km<sup>2</sup> where the species was common, and 0.03/km<sup>2</sup> elsewhere (East 1999). However, the fact that Southern Reedbuck occurs in 'islands' of suitable habitat complicates extrapolations from generalised density estimates (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). The overall population trends were considered generally stable in protected areas, increasing on private land and decreasing elsewhere (various authors in East 1999).",Stable,"The Southern Reedbuck (<em>Redunca arundinum</em>) occurs from the extreme south of Gabon in the west to Tanzania and then south to South Africa (East 1999, Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). The species remains widespread in protected areas and other sites with low to moderate levels of settlement, including significant populations on private land in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia. Southern Reedbuck formerly occurred locally in the savannas of southern Republic of Congo, where its presence was last confirmed in 1974 in Mount Fouari Faunal Reserve but it may now be extinct as a result of intensive hunting (East 1999). In Namibia the species occurs naturally in the north-east but has been introduced to private land outside its natural range in the northern farming districts, where it is now relatively numerous (East 1999, Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). Lynch and Watson (1990) sighted one individual in Sehlabathebe N.P. in Lesotho, but this may have been a vagrant from KwaZulu-Natal.

They are absent only from deserts and sub-deserts, such as the Namib/Kalahari, the arid Horn of Africa and the Saharan/Sahelian transition zone (Prins and Sinclair 2013, Cornélis<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2014).","Habitat loss due to expansion of settlements and agriculture, livestock grazing and forest clearance is a major threat outside protected areas (and encroachment occurs where protection is ineffective). Buffalo are favoured target of meat hunters in many countries, and poaching has been a major contributor to the recent decline of many buffalo populations, including in some national parks. War and civil unrest especially in Central Africa over the last 30 years has had – and continues to have – a negative effect. Buffalo are susceptible to drought, which has caused substantial declines in some populations in the Sahel at the end of the 1960s and during the 1990s in Tsavo, Serengeti/Mara, Gonarezhou and Kruger also strongly impacted buffalo populations (East 1999, Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>African Buffalo are susceptible to a range of indigenous and imported infectious diseases. In the past, numbers of African Buffalo suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, coupled with pleuro-pneumonia, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates (Winterbach 1998). Rinderpest was declared eradicated in Africa in 2011 (Morens&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2011).","Aerial counts have been widely used for 60 years to count African Buffalo, but this method is subject to a number of biases (East 1999, Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). East (1999) summed country counts for the three savanna buffalo subspecies and estimated a total of &gt;627,000 (<em>aequinoctialis</em>: &gt;59,000; <em>brachyceros</em>: &gt;20,000; <em>caffer</em>: &gt;548,000). He then applied a correction factor of 1.2 for undercounting in aerial surveys and assumed average densities where no figures were available to produce an estimate of 830,000, while acknowledging the lack of precision and suggesting the population size lay between 500,00 and 1,000,000. Survey data were (and are) unavailable for forest buffalo, and East (1999) estimated average densities of 0.03/km² where known to be common and 0.03 where uncommon and produced a rough estimate of 60,000, a figure he suggested was likely to be conservative. <br/><br/>Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014) updated the figures for the savanna buffalo by country and protected area according to the latest available data and produced a total estimate of &gt;513,000, representing an overall decline of 18% during 1999-2014 when compared to East’s figure. Subspecies totals were: <em>aequinoctialis</em>&#160;&gt;23,00 (-61% since East 1999); <em>brachyceros</em>: &gt;17,000 (-15%); <em>caffer</em>: &gt;473,000 (-14%). <br/><br/>The same caveats (undercounting bias and unavailability of figures for many areas) also apply to the later figures as they do to the earlier ones, but they have been derived on broadly the same basis and provide an indication of trends. The decline in Central African savanna buffalo is particularly marked and influenced by war and unrest and governance issues in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan (Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). West African savanna buffalo populations show contrasting trends across sites and countries. For example, substantial investments in the WAP complex of protected areas (Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger) appear to have increased the effectiveness of management, while Comoe N.P. (Ivory Coast) and Niokolo N.P. (Senegal) have seen their buffalo populations fall by 90% (Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). <em>Syncerus c. caffer </em>appears stable across much of its range and the lower figure may be due mainly to a decline in Tanzania (Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Very few figures are available for Forest Buffalo but it is suspected to be declining across its range. Forest loss in West Africa has been far higher than in Central Africa (Christie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Norris <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Hansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and rates of bushmeat extraction are high and increasing.<br/><br/>Adding 60,000 Forest Buffalo to the 513,000 estimated by Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014 gives a total figure of 573,000. If this subspecies (<em>nanus</em>) declined at 15% (i.e., showing similar to declines to those of <em>brachyceros </em>and <em>caffer</em>) in 1999-2014, its population would be roughly 56,000. Thus a very approximate global estimate of the buffalo population is 569,000-573,000 (398,000-401,000 mature individuals).<br/><br/>African Buffalo numbers were already declining in the 1990s (East 1999), so the rates of decline over the last 3 generations (28 years) must have been higher than the figures shown above, though it is difficult to estimate a precise figure because the rate of decline pre-1999 is unknown. <br/><br/>Buffalo numbers are predicted to continue to decline because of ongoing poaching for meat, habitat conversion, and expansion of human and domestic livestock populations. Extrapolating the current estimated decline (1999-2014) into the future over 3 generations (1999-2027), and under three scenarios, produces the following figures:&#160; <br/><ul><li>Savanna buffalo (<em>S.c. caffer, S.c. aequinoctialis, S.c. brachyceros</em>) - 1999: 627,000 individuals; 2014: 513,000 individuals; 2027: predicted 431,000 individuals&#160;= -31.2%.</li><li>Savanna (as above) + forest buffalo&#160;<em>S.c. nanus</em> (assuming -15% for forest buffalo) - 1999: 687,000 individuals; 2014: 569,000 individuals; 2027: predicted 483,000 individuals&#160;= -29.7%.</li><li>Savanna (as above) + forest buffalo (assuming no decline for forest buffalo) - 1999: 687,000 individuals; 2014: 573,000 individuals; 2027: predicted 490,000 individuals&#160;= -28.7%.</li></ul>These rates of decline are very close to, or perhaps already over, the threshold for threatened status. Moreover, these calculations assume a linear rate of decline, but the decline may be expected to actually accelerate, especially in view of the threats and projections for human population growth.",Decreasing,"The African Buffalo once occurred across most of sub-Saharan Africa. There is no palaeontological evidence of the presence of the species in North Africa or in the Nile Valley north of Khartoum (Prins and Sinclair 2013). In North Africa, aurochs<em> Bos primigenius</em>, the progenitor of domestic cattle, occupied a similar niche and perhaps prevented the buffalo’s spread to the north (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Rainfall is a limiting factor and African Buffalo generally occupy areas with annual rainfall above 250 mm and where herbaceous forage is available (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>African Buffalo populations have undergone a severe reduction in size and geographical distribution since the 19th century, as a result of anthropogenic impacts (land conversion, poaching, disease outbreaks) and climatic events such as droughts (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Around 70% of savanna buffalo populations are confined to a patchwork of protected areas and surrounding hunting zones (East 1999). During the 20th century, the distribution has been actively reduced in several countries by culling and veterinary fences, in efforts to limit the transmission of pathogens, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and trypanosomiasis, to cattle (Taylor and Martin 1987). <br/><br/><strong>Forest Buffalo<em> </em>(<em>S. c. nanus</em>)</strong><br/>This subspecies has a disjunct distribution: one area in the rainforest belt of West Africa and another in Lower Guinea Forest and Congo Basin (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Both areas of distribution are mainly located in areas with an annual rainfall &gt;1,500 mm, in transition zones between dense tropical forests and savanna ecosystems (East 1999). In West Africa, forest buffalo are distributed from Guinea-Bissau to south-west Ghana. In Central Africa, they occur in southern Nigeria, southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, south and south-west Central African Republic, western Uganda, western Rwanda and possibly north-west Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Gabon. About 75% of the population lives in and around protected areas in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Republic of Congo. In both areas of distribution, numbers have declined substantially due to poaching and deforestation (East 1999), but their status is generally poorly known (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). They became extinct on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea) sometime between 1860 and 1910 (Butynski <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997).<br/><br/><strong>West African Savanna Buffalo (<em>S. c. brachyceros</em>)</strong><br/>This subspecies still occurs locally in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone, occupying savannas and gallery forests, from south-eastern Senegal, northern Ivory Coast, southern Burkina Faso, northern Ghana and Benin, extreme south of Niger, Nigeria (very locally), northern Cameroon and a small area of the Central African Republic (East 1999).<br/><br/><strong>Central African Savanna Buffalo (<em>S. c. aequinoctialis</em>)</strong><br/>This subspecies still occurs locally in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone of Central Africa: south-east Chad, northern Central African Republic (East of the Chari River), northern Democratic Republic of Congo, south-east Sudan and western Ethiopia (East 1999). It is now extinct in Eritrea.<br/><br/><strong>Cape Buffalo </strong><strong>(</strong><em><strong>S. c. caffer</strong></em><strong>)</strong><em><br/></em>Cape Buffalo occurs in south-western Ethiopia (particularly Omo N.P.), southern Somalia and northern Kenya southwards to South Africa. It is patchily distributed throughout East Africa, southwards to Zambia, Malawi, some parts of Mozambique (small populations south of the Zambezi river with most in the north of the country), Niassa Reserve and Cabo Delgado areas (Skinner and Chimimba 2005); north-eastern Namibia (mainly eastern and western Caprivi and an introduced population in the Waterberg Plateau Park, central Namibia), Botswana (north of 20°S, Okavango Delta, Moremi Game Reserve and Chobe N.P.), and Zimbabwe (Hwange N.P., Matabeleland, Zambezi Valley, and Gonarezhou National Park; Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Small populations of Cape Buffalo still survive in some areas of south-east Angola (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In South Africa, Cape buffalo have been reintroduced to some areas from which they were formerly extirpated. They are currently widely distributed in Kruger N.P. and smaller populations persist in KwaZuluNatal and in many private reserves; the current population in Swaziland is a reintroduction (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","African Buffalo is a favoured target for bushmeat hunters. It is also a prized target for trophy hunters, especially in southern Africa. The species is bred on many game farms and traded; large bulls fetch a high price.",Terrestrial,"About 70-75% of buffalo populations occur in and around protected areas (East 1999), and the future status of this species is closely linked to effective protected areas and well-managed hunting zones. <br/><br/>In 2012 there were 166 Cape Buffalo and 135 forest buffalo in captivity (Cornélis <em>et al. </em>2014).

The population has increased significantly over three generations (1990-2015) in formally protected areas across its range and it is suspected to have also increased on private lands. Apart from hybridisation there are currently no major threats to long-term survival. The number of mature individuals of<em> D. p. pygargrus</em> is estimated at 752–1,618 individuals, but the number of pure Bontebok is unknown and the area of occupancy is limited and available habitat is decreasing.","<em>Damaliscus p. phillipsi </em>occur primarily on grasslands, especially open  plateau grasslands, characteristic of the South African Highveld,  extending to altitudes of up to 2,000 m asl (East 1999). They prefer  short grass and depend largely on the availability of drinking water  (David and Lloyd 2013). <em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> is very closely associated with  the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion. They are almost exclusively  grazers with a preference for short grass and recently burnt veld  (Beukes 1984, 1987; Novellie 1987; Kraaij and Novellie 2010). Water is  an essential requirement and they stay within 1.5 km of surface water  during the dry season.<br/><br/><em>Damaliscus p. pygargus</em> are adapted to unique  habitat and climatic conditions: the East Coast Renosterveld bioregion  receives some rain throughout the year but has a distinct peak during  winter with about 65% of rain falling between April and October. This  subspecies has thus adapted over at least 20,000 years to a climate of  wet and cold winters and warm and dry summers, the opposite to the  conditions experienced by <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> with warm and wet  summers and very cold but dry winters.<br/><br/>For further detail see the subspecies accounts.","The translocation of both Blesbok and Bontebok outside their natural range is a significant threat to the continued existence of the two subspecies, as hybridisation takes place and becomes increasingly likely. <br/><br/>The major threats for <em>D. p. pygargus</em> are hybridisation with <em>D. p. phillipsi,</em> the lack of available habitat within the natural range, low genetic diversity (probably the result of two bottlenecks caused by overhunting and disease; van der Walt <em>et al</em>. 2001) and poor gene flow between subpopulations. The overall management concern is the lack of a metapopulation management strategy for this subspecies.<br/><br/>Hybridisation is currently a priority issue in <em>D. p. pygargus</em>, but the extent of hybridisation in the <em>D. p. phillipsi</em> population is currently unknown and further research is required.

Giant Elands feed mostly on leaves, shoots, herbs and fruits (but occasionally on grasses), and will drink daily where water is available (Planton and Michaux 2013).","The distribution of Derby Eland is mainly restricted to PAs and hunting zones. In CAR and South Sudan, political instability and armed conflict are major barriers to the implementation of effective protection and management. Bushmeat hunting, snaring, encroachment by livestock grazers and smallholder cultivation are threats across most of the range. In the past, Giant Eland suffered heavy mortality from rinderpest, to which it is said to be more susceptible than any other antelope. Its demise in The Gambia has been attributed primarily to the devastating effects of this disease (Camara 1990). Populations in the Central African region crashed by 60-80% during and after the 1983-1984 rinderpest outbreak, but later recovered (East 1999).<br/><br/>The Western Giant Eland has been reduced to very low numbers by factors  such as over-hunting for meat and habitat destruction caused by the  expansion of human and livestock populations.","East (1999) estimated that there were probably more than 15,000 Eastern Giant Eland remaining, with over 12,500 in the CAR.

This suggests a total population of the Eastern Giant Eland at the time of around 15,000-20,000. However, political instability and civil conflict in South Sudan and CAR in the last 10-15 years have greatly disrupted protection and management in PAs and halted trophy hunting operations in many parts of CAR. At the same time, hunting for bushmeat and encroachment into PAs by agriculturalists and livestock herders have increased.

On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) reported apparent feeding by Fin Whales on American Sand Lance (Sand Eel),&#160;<em>Ammodytes americanus,</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1972) found that Capelin, <em>Mallotus villosus</em>, comprised 80-90% of prey in Fin Whales caught off Newfoundland. Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and Fin Whales may feed opportunistically on Capelin in years with high abundance.<br/><br/>The Fin Whale is the fastest of the great whales, being able to maintain speeds of over 10 ms<sup>-1</sup> or 20 kn (Bose and Lien 1989). The high speed is likely an adaptation to avoid predation by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em>, (Ford and Reeves 2008) rather than to catch fast prey, because maximum speeds associated with lunge feeding are thought to be below 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> (Potvin <em>et al</em>. 2009). The apparent lack of winter breeding aggregations may also be an adaptation to avoid predation of calves, in the context of a flight rather than fight strategy to escape predation.&#160;</p>","<p>Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, Fin Whales were not subject to much human predation because they were hard to catch, but they were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin Whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1976, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small “aboriginal subsistence” catches off Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, but none have been taken in 2016 or 2017. A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of Fin Whales in the Antarctic in 2005, but this also has been discontinued. It seems unlikely that catching of Fin Whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/> <br/> Fin Whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale reported in vessel collisions (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001, IWC 2018d). An average of 2 collisions per year between Fin Whales and vessels was recorded off the U.S. east coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although reported incidents have been very few relative to the abundance of the species, most collisions involving large vessels are probably not detected, and to date there has been no satisfactory quantitative assessment of the actual risk. There is concern that collisions in the Mediterranean, especially in the main summering ground of Fin Whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Lyon where there are high densities of both whales and vessels, may be frequent enough to impact the population there (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are also subject to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Nine cases of entanglement were recorded off the U.S. coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2017). Five entanglements involving Fin Whales worldwide were reported to the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (Hughes 2018). Although not all countries report, and some incidents will be missed by those that do, it appears likely that, globally, the threat from entanglement is low relative to the overall abundance of the species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic<br/></em></strong>The Fin Whale was not easily catchable by early whalers due to its size and speed, but was heavily exploited from the start of mechanized whaling in 1864, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes, and the British Isles. Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Fin whaling was phased out in the 1980s except for small catches off West Greenland. Catches resumed off western Iceland in 2007, but no catches have been taken there since 2015 (IWC 2018a).<br/> <br/> Catch statistics for the early years are incomplete: some are not divided into species, and a significant number of whales,&#160;perhaps 30-50%,&#160;were killed but lost due to lines breaking, etc. (Johnsen 1959, IWC 2017). The International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has produced “best” and “high” estimates of Fin Whale kills in the North Atlantic totalling 98,000 and 115,000 respectively (IWC 2017).<br/><br/>Over the last three decades several sets of surveys have been conducted in the North Atlantic in summer to estimates the abundance of Fin Whales and other cetacean species. The most recent abundance estimates for each area are: East Greenland coastal 6,440 (CV 0.26) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018); East Greenland (excl. coastal), Iceland, and Faeroes 40,788 (CV 0.17) in 2015 (NASS2015 surveys, Pike <em>et al</em>. 2016); Norway and Jan Mayen 6,409 (CV 0.18) in 1996-2001 (Øien 2009); UK waters, North and Irish Seas, French and Spanish Atlantic waters and coast of Portugal 18,142 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (SCANS III surveys, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017); Atlantic Canada 3,522 (CV 0.27) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin 2009); U.S. east coast 1,595 (CV 0.33) in 2011 (Palka 2012); West Greenland 2,215 (CV 0.41) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018). The available estimates total about 79,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.13.&#160;These figures do not include the waters to the west of Ireland, where Fin Whales are fairly abundant. Data collected in Norwegian waters during 2002-17 have&#160; yet (May 2018) to be worked up.<br/><br/>Compared with previous estimates, the latest estimates show a substantial increase for the East Greenland–Iceland–Faroes area but an annual rate of increase that takes survey differences into account has not yet been calculated. The estimates for the Spain–Portugal–France–British Isles area show little change over the years from the first estimate of 17,355 (CV 0.27) obtained in 1989 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). The trends in U.S., Canadian, western Greenlandic, and Norwegian waters have yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The overall increase in North Atlantic Fin Whales may represent a continuing recovery from past whaling, but it has also been hypothesized that the recovery was already essentially complete by 2000 and that the latest increase is due to environmental changes (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>Within the Mediterranean, the Fin Whale population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western basin at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1996). Given the relative rarity of Fin Whales in the Mediterranean outside this area, a total population of about 5,000 for the Mediterranean is plausible (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The relative abundance in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Gulf of Lyon has been monitored since 2009 from ferries on fixed routes, but the counts are too variable to estimate a trend (Cominelli <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Catches of about 7,000 Fin Whales taken in and near the Straits of Gibraltar during the 1920s depleted the local abundance and may have reduced a population migrating between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em><br/></strong>Some Fin Whales were likely taken by pre-modern whaling in Japan although the different species of <em>Balaenopter</em><em><em>a</em> were not always distinguished (Omura 1986). </em>A total of 76,000 Fin Whales are recorded taken by modern whaling in the North Pacific during 1910-75 (Allison 2017). The total killed is likely to be higher, because many or most of the approximately 6,500 unspecified whales taken during 1900-09 may have been Fin Whales, and in the early years of modern whaling there were likely, as in the North Atlantic, a substantial number of whales that were killed but not successfully landed. Fin Whales were legally protected from whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific from 1976, but small catches, reported at the time as Bryde’s Whales (<em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>), continued off Korea until 1981. These whales were probably from the East China Sea population.<br/><br/>North Pacific Fin Whale stocks have not been assessed in depth by the IWC Scientific Committee since 1973, when the assessment by Ohsumi and Wada (1974) was accepted. It was updated by Allen (1977). The stock in the western North Pacific was estimated to have declined from an “initial level” of 44,000 to 17,000 in 1975. The figures refer to the “exploitable” population, i.e., whales above the minimum allowed size at capture. Although these assessments were based on indices of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) that did not meet modern requirements for the analysis of such data (IWC 1989), there is no doubt that the populations declined substantially.<br/><br/>There is currently no population estimate for Fin Whales in the North Pacific as a whole, but one may become available once existing data holdings are worked up. The abundance information for each area is summarized here.<br/><br/>In surveys conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015, the Fin Whale was consistently the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (Miyashita 2004, Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011; Minamikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016) but the data have not yet been worked up to produce an abundance estimate.<br/><br/>The area of the northwestern Pacific bounded by the 170°E meridian, the coast of Japan, and the border of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, has been surveyed during 2002-2015 by vessels associated with the JARPN II (2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programme in the North Pacific) programme. An estimate of about 4,000 Fin Whales (CV 0.4) was derived from data collected in July-August 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016).<br/><br/>The area between the 170°E and 135°W meridians. bounded to the north by the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian chain, was surveyed by the POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) international cruise in July and August over the years 2010-2012 (IWC 2018c). The data have not yet been worked up to yield an abundance estimate for Fin Whales, but the counts show that Fin Whales were approximately as abundant as Sei Whales, for which an estimate of about 30,000 whales (CV 0.24) has been calculated (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is planned to survey the Bering Sea in three parts over 2017-2019 under the POWER programme (IWC 2018c). The eastern Bering Sea was covered in 2017, and the Fin Whale was the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (<a href=""https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan"">https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan</a>). The eastern Bering Sea had previously been covered by U.S. fishery surveys, yielding an estimate of 1,061 (CV 0.38) Fin Whales (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013). Zerbini <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated the abundance of Fin Whales to be 1,652 (CV ~0.2) in the coastal waters south of the Alaska Peninsula, which is included in the area surveyed by the 2011-12 POWER. An estimate of 4.8% for the annual rate of increase over the period 1987-2003 was obtained with nominal confidence limits of 4.1%-5.4%, but subsequent recalculation of the variance from the data indicates much lower precision (95% confidence limits -1.6% to +11.1% per year) (IWC 2009). In a survey of the western Bering Sea in 2005, Fin Whales (along with Humpback Whales) were the most frequently encountered species, but no abundance estimate has been calculated (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted during 2004-08, Best <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated the abundance Fin Whales in the waters of British Columbia (Canada) to be 329 (95% confidence interval (CI) 274-395).<br/><br/>The summer abundance off the west coast of the continental U.S.A. (Washington/Oregon/California) is estimated to have been 9,029 (CV 0.12) whales in 2014, while the average rate of increase over 1991-2014 was 7.5% per year. (Nadeem <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the variation around the trend line was greater than would be expected from sampling variance alone, suggesting that a variable proportion of the population is found in the area each year.<br/><br/>This genetically isolated Gulf of California subpopulation was estimated in 2004 from a mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data at 613 (CI 426-970) (Díaz-Guzman 2006). There are no data on population trend for this subpopulation.<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Along with other baleen whales, the IWC has traditionally managed Southern Hemisphere Fin Whales on the basis of six management areas, Areas I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50°-70° wide. The areas were originally chosen as putative management stocks for Humpback Whales, and later used for all baleen whales, with little or no biological support (Donovan 1991).<br/><br/> Over 725,000 Fin Whales have been recorded caught in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905-76 (Allison 2017). There was a series of assessments in the 1970s, including a synthesis by Chapman (1976) which was reassessed for Area I by Breiwick (1977), and updated for Areas II-VI by Allen (1977). A later reassessment of Area VI Fin Whales was inconclusive (IWC 1980). <br/> <br/> These assessments were based on a combination of evidence, including trends in CPUE by whaling fleets, sighting rates by Japanese scouting vessels, and inferences on recruitment and mortality rates from age and length data. Their reliability is questionable on various grounds. For example, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently determined that CPUE data should only be used for stock assessments when the nature of the whaling operations is fully described (IWC 1989). A reanalysis of the historical data using modern methods and insights is warranted.<br/> <br/> Regular sightings surveys in the Antarctic south of 60°S were conducted under the IDCR/SOWER programmes in summer during 1978-2010 (IWC 2018) and the JARPA/II (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programmes in the Antarctic) in summer during 1987-2014 (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, only 55% of the historic summer catch taken during 1904-76 occurred south of 60°S, the remainder having been taken mainly between 50°-60°S. Hence there is probably considerable abundance outside the surveyed areas.<br/><br/>Circumpolar estimates from the IDCR/SOWER surveys increased from 2,100 during 1978-91 (CV 0.28) to 5,100 (CV 0.52) during 1991-98 (Branch and Butterworth 2001) but the more recent data do not appear to have been worked up. An extrapolation of the abundance estimate for 1978-91 to the area south of 30°S using Japanese Scouting Vessel data from 1978-88 yielded a circumpolar estimate of 15,000 (no variance given) (IWC 1996). The Scouting Vessel data were not collected according to any kind of statistical design and should be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Estimates from the JARPA/II surveys covering just half the Antarctic from 35°E to 145°W (southern Indian Ocean and south-west Pacific sectors) increased from 5,000 (CV 0.15) in 1996 to 17,600 (CV 0.26) in 2008, but large inter-annual fluctuations in the abundance suggested that the proportion of the population within the surveyed area varied from year to year (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). Approximately three-quarters of the historical catch came from within the 35°E-145°W sector.<br/><br/>Other data sources cover only limited areas and lack long enough time series to estimate trends. As examples, Viquerat and Herr (2017) estimated abundances of about 500 and 800 Fin Whales around Elephant Island and the South Orkneys respectively.<br/><br/>The current circumpolar abundance remains highly uncertain until all existing data are worked up and more data are collected from the zone 50°-60°S. Overall the information suggests a substantial increase has occurred, but the rate of increase is poorly quantified. All estimates of the rate of increase have very low precision but are compatible with an intrinsic growth rate of around 4-5% per year as assumed in the latest assessments.<br/><br/><strong><em>Biological parameters and assessment</em><br/> </strong>Estimates of age at sexual maturity for female Fin Whales, based on observed proportions mature by age, are 6-7 years in the Southern Hemisphere from British catches in the 1960s (Lockyer 1972) and Japanese catches in the 1960s and early 1970s (Mizroch 1981), but these values are likely negatively biased due to selection against smaller animals. For the North Atlantic, Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. (2013) report a value for Fin Whales caught off Iceland of around 8 years during 1965-89, increasing to 14 years during 2006-10, although the sample size in the later years was small. Aguilar <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated 7.9 years from catches off Spain during 1979-84. There do not seem to be any precise values for the North Pacific, but Kimura (Ohsumi) <em>et al</em>. (1958) estimated 8-12 years. For the purpose of this assessment, the age at first reproduction of 10 years (9 years for age at sexual maturity) as estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007 is assumed. The values of other biological parameters (age at first capture, net recruitment rate, and natural mortality rate) were taken from the previous IWC Scientific Committee assessments (IWC 2017, Allen 1977).<br/><br/>The generation time for a non-depleted Fin Whale population is estimated to be 25.9 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The 3-generation window for application of the&#160;Red List&#160;A criterion is 1940-2018.<br/><br/>Because the available published assessments for this Fin Whales are not up to date, an illustrative population assessment is conducted here to enable estimation of a plausible population trajectory over the period 1940-2018 relative to the A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, it is reasonable to use conventional population assessment methods to provide a crude indication of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately.<br/><br/>Based on the above (incomplete) information, the following population numbers (total, including immature whales) are assumed for the purpose of this Red list assessment:<br/></p><ul><li>North Atlantic: 70,000 whales in 2015; <br/></li><li>North Pacific: 50,000 whales in 2011; <br/></li><li>Southern Hemisphere: 25,000 whales in 2008.</li></ul><p>The parameter values are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material (which forms an integral part of this assessment). The estimated global trajectory for the number of mature individuals indicates that the 2018 mature population size is about 100,000 whales and may be around 45% of the 1940 level, which implies a classification of Vulnerable under the A1 criterion. According to this trajectory, there had already been considerable decline prior to 1940, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For completeness it should be noted that other models have been posited that imply an increasing Fin Whale population prior to 1940 in the Southern Hemisphere (Mori and Butterworth 2006) but the pre-1940 period does not affect the Red List assessment against criterion A.</p>",Increasing,"<p>Fin Whales occur worldwide, mainly, but not exclusively, in offshore waters of the temperate and subpolar zones (Edwards&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2015). They show some poleward migration in summer but appear to be present at some level throughout their range throughout the year. Fin Whales are considered rare or absent in most of the tropics but were hunted off Peru and Ecuador and in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century (Allison 2017), and are still occasionally observed in the tropics, for example off Peru (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Seychelles (Keller <em>et al</em>. 1982). There do not seem to remain any confirmed records from the northern Indian Ocean, after correcting misidentifications (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>In the North Atlantic, the Fin Whale’s range extends as far as Svalbard (Norway) in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay (Canada and Greenland) in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands (Spain) in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001), where the few recorded strandings may be extralimital vagrants (Whitt <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Their main summer range in the northwestern Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (U.S.A.) (39°N) northward (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). They occur in summer (and possibly year-round) west and east of Greenland, around Iceland and the Faroe Islands and along the Iceland-Faroes ridge, and to a lesser extent in the Norwegian Sea and around Jan Mayen (Øien 2009). They occur off the northern and western British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay off northwestern Spain but are rare in the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). They regularly occur off the Azores in spring (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011) and have been detected acoustically west of Madeira (32°N) in winter (Castellotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it appears from acoustic data that at least male North Atlantic Fin Whales are present throughout most of the range throughout the year (Morano <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are present in the central and western Mediterranean, mainly north and east of the Balearic Islands, and appear to be a mixture of a resident population and one migrating between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Notabartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2016). The area of abundance seems to be concentrated in the Ligurian Sea and the Gulf of Lyon in summer, but expands to cover much of the western and central Mediterranean in winter. Fin Whales are rare in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, do not penetrate far into the Adriatic or Aegean Seas, and are not present in the Black Sea. In the 20th century, Fin Whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar (Allison 2017) and observations in this century show Fin Whales leaving her Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar&#160; during May-October and (mostly) entering the Mediterranean during November-April (Gauffier <em>et al</em>. 2018); the observations of calves leaving the Mediterranean during May-July suggests they were born there.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific<br/></em></strong>In the eastern North Pacific, Fin Whales occur year-round off the central and southern California coast. They occur in summer off the entire coast of western North America from California into the Gulf of Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands. Fin Whales marked off California in winter were recaptured in summer by whaling operations along the entire coast, suggesting migration (Mizroch <em>et al</em>. 2009). Offshore, Fin Whales occur across the North Pacific north of 40°N, at least from May to September in summer, with some tendency for a northward shift in distribution in high summer, when they enter the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Melnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are also found along the east coast of Kamchatka (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017) and between Kamchatka and the Commander Islands (Miyashita 2006). They also occur in the Sea of Japan (Miyashita 2006). Fin Whales occur in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and have recently been detected as far as Point Barrow in the northeastern Chukchi, which may be an indication of a northward expansion as the Arctic warms (Crance <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are abundant in the offshore western North Pacific north of about 35°N in summer, and in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu (Japan) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2016), but in recent years have only rarely been seen off central and southern Japan or around the Korean peninsula at any time of year (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Sohn <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both are areas where large catches were taken in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Fin Whales in the East China Sea are thought to belong to a distinct subpopulation from those of the North Pacific (Fujino 1960), and it is possible that the Korean and southern Japanese catches came from this stock. There were a few net catches in the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait in the early 2000s (CRI 2005-07).<br/><br/>Fin Whales occur, albeit in small numbers, in Hawaiian waters in both summer and winter (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The winter distribution in the North Pacific poorly known. While there appears to be some migration, acoustic data suggest that overall there is little seasonality in distribution, but that there is seasonality in the amount of vocalization (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Fin Whales inhabiting the Gulf of California appear to be a resident, genetically isolated subpopulation (Bérubé <em>et al.</em> 2002). Telemetry information has shown year-round residency in this area, with seasonal latitudinal movements (Urbán <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere<br/></em></strong>Some Fin Whales penetrate into the high Antarctic, along with Blue (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), Minke (<em>B. bonaerensis</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), but are rarely seen in the pack ice. The Fin Whale summer distribution also extends into middle latitudes, as evidenced by both sightings and past catches (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Allison 2017). Fin Whales were abundant in summer in the Southern Ocean from 40°S to Antarctica in the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean sectors, and south of 50°-55°S in other sectors. Recent (post-whaling) data on Fin Whales in the Southern Ocean are available mainly for the area south of 60°S: for example, the international circumpolar IDCR/SOWER surveys under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1978-2009 (IWC 2019) which showed that Fin Whales were still distributed in all sectors of the Antarctic, but with a much reduced abundance (Branch and Butterworth 2001); more recently, surveys around the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands (Viquerat and Herr 2017, Joiris and Dochy 2013) found substantial local densities of Fin Whales.&#160;An area of suspected high Fin Whale density to the south of Bouvet Island (55°-57°S 0-5°E) was confirmed by a sighting survey conducted there in December 2006 (Ensor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Large numbers of Fin Whales were caught by whalers operating out of whaling stations on South Georgia (55°S) during 1904-65, but the species was rarely seen there in the ensuing three decades (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1999). Sightings have become more frequent lately but have not yet been quantitatively evaluated (Richardson 2012).<br/><br/>Outside the Antarctic, Fin Whales were caught in substantial numbers off the southwestern and southeastern coasts of southern Africa in winter, and in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also taken in the coastal waters of Mozambique, Angola, Congo, and Gabon (Best 1994), but they are very rare on the western coasts of southern and equatorial Africa today (Weir 2010, 2011). Catch rates of Fin Whales off South Africa declined to near zero by the early 1970s coincident with the severe depletion by whaling in the Southern Ocean, which suggests that this was a wintering ground for a population that migrated to the south in summer (Best 2003).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught off the coast of Peru, mainly in the austral winter, until catches petered out in the early 1970s. Sightings of Fin Whales in the eastern equatorial Pacific since whaling ended in 1976 have been relatively few, in contrast to Blue Whales which continued to be sighted frequently (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Landa <em>et al</em>. 1983, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught from several stations along the coast of Chile from 20° to 44°S from the early 20th century until 1983, but very few were caught after 1970. Catches were taken in all seasons but few in winter; the whales were typically small, with a modal length of 16-17m for each sex, compared with 20-21m (males) and 21-22m (females) for Fin Whales caught by Antarctic fleets. Given the lack of genetic distinction between fin whales in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (Pérez-Álvarez <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the recovery in the Antarctic of marks placed in Fin Whales off Chile (Clarke 1978), it is likely that the Chilean Fin Whales were juvenile Southern Fin Whales <em></em> rather than a race of small Fin Whales (Cooke 2019). In recent years, Fin Whales have been observed in nearshore Chilean waters from 23° to 29ºS during spring and summer and seen to be feeding there (Pérez <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2015, Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Toro <em>et al</em>. classed 502 out of 519 Fin Whale sightings around the Chanaral and Choros Islands (29°S) in summer and fall as ""adults"" but used a size criterion of 17m developed for the smaller North Atlantic Fin Whale; hence the ""adults"" could have included whales of any age class except calves of the year. Pacheco <em>et al</em>. reported two mother-calf pairs off northern Chile (Mejillones Bay, 23°S) in spring 2006.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are now rare in Brazilian waters, but there is virtually no information from the period before the depletion of the whales around South Georgia (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). A few were taken in a brief period of whaling in southern Brazil in the early 1960s.<br/><br/>Apart from the above-mentioned wintering grounds, the winter distribution of Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is poorly known. Some may remain in the far south while some may disperse into oceanic areas in temperate latitudes. Acoustic detections of Fin Whales in the Antarctic peak in the autumn (May) and are absent in winter and spring, but this may reflect seasonality of vocalization as much as presence/absence (Širović <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Other areas</em></strong><br/>The only confirmed records from Indonesia are two strandings in 1937 and 1975 (Rudolph <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may have been vagrants. A reported sighting off Sarawak (Malaysia) in 1999 (de Boer 2000) is unconfirmed.<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on a synthesis of occurrence records and oceanography. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p>","<p>Large-scale commercial harvesting of this species appears to have ceased, the last catches having been taken in the Antarctic in 2012 and in the North Atlantic in 2015 (IWC 2018a) but frozen products are probably still in trade. The latest entry in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database was an export of 2,546 tonnes of Fin Whale meat from Iceland to Japan in 2014, but only 1,624 tonnes appear to have reached Japan (CITES 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The IWC set catch limits at zero for Fin Whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere starting in 1976. The IWC adopted a provision (popularly known as the commercial whaling moratorium) in 1982 to set all catch limits for commercial whaling to zero from 1986, but Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation have lodged objections or reservations to the provision. Limited hunting of Fin Whales off western Greenland is permitted for “aboriginal subsistence” purposes.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are listed on Appendix I of CITES, but this does not apply to Iceland, Norway, and Japan, who hold reservations. Fin Whales are also listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS). Under the Agreement for Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, Fin Whales in the Mediterranean, along with other cetaceans, are protected from deliberate killing by signatories to the agreement.</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50649567,219,Acinonyx jubatus,Vulnerable,A2acd; C1,2015,2014-05-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The known Cheetah population is roughly 6,700 adult and adolescent animals distributed across 29 subpopulations. These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici<em>&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durant<em> et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003, Mills <em>et al. </em>2004, Cooper <em>et al. </em>2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall<em> et al. </em>2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker <em>et al. </em>2003c, Durant <em>et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir<em> et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis<em> et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe<em> et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al. </em>1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen <em>et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies <em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa,<em> A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel<em> et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for <em>A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase <em>et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50651463,8540,Felis chaus,Least Concern,,2016,2014-06-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Jungle Cat remains probably the most common cat species in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh), where the majority of the global population occurs and despite likely extensive declines in mainland Southeast Asia, where the species is now extremely scarce and largely restricted to remote lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Gray <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), it is unlikely that globally averaged declines are sufficient to merit Near Threatened status. Population declines and range contraction are also of concern elsewhere in the species’ range particularly in Egypt (Glas 2013), southwest Asia (Abu-Baker<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2003), the Caucasus (IUCN 2007), central Asia (Habibi 2004) and parts of Turkey (Ogurlu <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, very little new information has been obtained from these regions since the previous assessment. Nevertheless,<strong> </strong>ongoing collation of records, particularly from South Asia, is needed and evidence of declines, particularly outside protected areas may merit reassessment.<br/><br/>In India, there is evidence of continued, and likely accelerating, habitat loss and ongoing poaching for both skins and, potentially, as a result of conflict with farmers (Choudhury 2010, Chowdhury <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2015, S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). The Jungle Cat's preference for open scrub and grassland in South Asia makes the species more susceptible to habitat loss than cat species which also utilise denser evergreen forests.<br/><br/>The majority of the suitable Indian habitat is classified as ‘wasteland’ which legally eases conversion into any other form of use particularly industrialisation and urbanization – the latter has been identified as a particular threat in India given the pace of urbanisation of agricultural and unprotected forest areas (S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). Hybridisation with domestic cats is also a potential, although unproven, threat. There remains uncertainty as to how the species will respond to habitat loss, and potential interactions with hunting and persecution. Therefore, further research is recommended, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, in order to gather additional data for a more thorough future assessment of the species' likely trends in response to habitat loss. Generally, more information on the species' ecology and status is needed across its range.","The Jungle Cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with the classic rainforest ""jungle"" habitat, but rather with wetlands - habitats with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments - scrubland, and deciduous dipterocarp forest (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Water and dense ground cover can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert (where it is found near oases or along riverbeds) to grassland, shrubby woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Areas with extensive deciduous dipterocarp forest and at least scattered surface water are the species predominant known habitat in Indochina. However, areas such as the Nakai Plateau which support other forms of savanna-like vegetation may support the species. It is probably absent from all closed canopy forests, including rainforest. The species may make use of agricultural areas with a low intensity of human use and which retain patches of scrub (Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2005).&#160;In Iran, the Jungle Cat was found in a variety of habitats such as from plains, agriculture lands and mountains but was mostly found in shrub lands and woodlands (Sanei&#160;<em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;</em>2016). In&#160;the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the favourite habitat of it was reed thickets, thorn bush thickets and thick lowland forests near water bodies (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;An analysis of habitat preferences, from camera-trap photographs, in eastern Cambodia demonstrated a strong preference for deciduous dipterocarp forests with no encounters (c.f. Leopard cat) in other forest types (Gray&#160;<em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Jungle cats have adapted well to irrigated cultivation, having been observed in many different types of agricultural and forest plantations throughout their range, such as sugar cane plantations in India.  In Israel, they can be found around pisciculture ponds and irrigation ditches.  Vereschagin (1959) noted that the Jungle Cat's use of the semi-arid plains of Azerbaijan increased with the development of a local irrigation system and decreased with its abandonment.  However, mowing the seasonally flooded riverine tugai vegetation (trees and shrubs with dense stands of tall reeds and grasses) of this region for livestock fodder, as well as ploughing it under for agriculture, is known to be associated with the decline of Jungle Cat populations in the European-central Asian parts of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>In India, in a study in the Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, the Jungle Cat was mostly active in the night hours (Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>2011), whereas in Cambodia, Jungle Cats were found to be more active during the day (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Jungle Cats feed mainly on prey that weighs less than one kilogram.  Small mammals, principally rodents,  are the prey most frequently found in feces and stomach contents (Adhya 2014, Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). A study in India's Sariska reserve estimated that Jungle Cats catch and eat three to five rodent per day (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004).  Birds rank second in importance, but in southern Russia waterfowl are the mainstay of Jungle Cat diet in the winter.  With overwintering populations of waterfowl congretating in large numbers on unfrozen rivers and marshes, the Jungle Cat hunts among reed beds and along edges of wetlands, searching for injured or weakened birds.  Other prey species are taken more opportunistically, including hares, nutria, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and fish (Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Ogurlu <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002,&#160;Patel 2011). In India, they have been seen to scavenge kills of large predators such as the Asiatic lion.  In a study in southern Uzbekistan, the fruits of the Russian olive made up 17% of their diet in winter.  While Jungle Cats specialize on small prey, they are large and powerful enough to kill young swine, subadult gazelles, and chital fawns (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Density estimates from natural tugai habitat in central Asia range from 4-15 individuals per 10 km², but where this vegetation type has declined due to development density it does not exceed 2 cats per 10 km² (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The biggest threat to Jungle Cat is habitat loss&#160;particularly industrialisation and urbanisation of low intensity agricultural areas and scrubland in the Indian subcontinent. Habitat destruction for agricultural purposes and infrastructure development are also issues in Turkey and Iran (Ogurlu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2010, Sanei<em> <em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). In Turkey, wetlands are mainly threatened by dam constructions and irrigation projects (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014). Additionally, environmental pollution and illegal hunting are threatening the Jungle Cat in Turkey too (Ogurlu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Also in Iran, illegal killing of Jungle Cats by shooting or trapping is a threat (Sanei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2016). Jungle cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Nevertheless, the species' response to urbanisation and degradation of low intensity agricultural landscapes is unclear and merits further research.<br/><br/>Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).  India formerly exported large numbers of Jungle Cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979), and some illegal trade (and killing) continues there (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010), elsewhere in South Asia (Chowdhury <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014) as well as in Egypt (Glas 2013) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004). The scarcity of Jungle Cat in mainland Southeast Asia is likely the result of high levels of hunting in open and accessible deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","In Europe, the Jungle Cat is of marginal occurrence, with small populations in Cis-Caspian region and the Caucasus along the Caspian Sea. The European population has been rapidly declining since the 1960s. There was no records of this species in Astrakhan State Reserve (Russian Federation) since the 1980s. In Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation) only about 150 animals were recorded (Kuryatnikov and Varziev 1983).&#160;In the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the number of Jungle Cats was estimated at 105 animals in 2009, at 216 in 2010, at 177 in 2011, at 110 in 2012 and at 307 animals in 2013, showing population fluctuations (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;Marked population fluctuations are characteristic of this species in this region, probably because of absence of adaptations to cold winters. Despite these fluctuations the long-term trend in Europe is of decline in both population and area of occupancy. Data from Russia suggest that there are about 500 animals left in the wild (Prisazhnyuk and Belousova 2007). A very small population persists in Georgia (I. Macharashvili pers. comm. to K. Tsysulina 2007). This species is considered threatened in a number of range states in Europe and the Caucasus, and is included in the Red Books of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (IUCN 2007). In southwest Asia the species is considered rare and threatened (Abu-Baker&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Habibi 2004). However, the Jungle Cat is considered common in some parts of its range, primarily in India (Mukherjee 1998, Patel 2011), but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2005). Nevertheless, in southern China and southeast Asia, it appears quite rare in comparison to sympatric small cats (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2005).  This rarity appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon associated with unselective trapping and snaring, especially in Lao PDR and Thailand as well, where it was described as common by Lekagul and McNeely (1977) but has since suffered drastic declines and is rarely encountered (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). There are a number of recent camera-trap records from the Eastern Plains Landscape protected area complex in eastern Cambodia (Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and this area likely remains the stronghold of the species outside South Asia.",Decreasing,"The Jungle Cat has a broad but patchy distribution.  In Africa, it is found only in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley south to Aswan, and in El Faiyum, Farafara, Dakhla and Kharga oases (Glas 2013). In Southwest Asia its occurrence is highly localized around riparian vegetation and permanent water sources.&#160;It occurs through Israel, southern Lebanon, northwestern Jordan, western Syria, Turkey, Iraq and into Iran where it is found in the north, from the provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran westwards along the Caspain Sea coastline and Hyrcanian forests to the West Azarbaijan Province (Abu-Baker <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2003, Sanei <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).&#160;In Turkey, the Jungle Cat has a fragmented distribution and seems to be quite widely distributed in the south of the country but to be restricted especially to wetland areas (Gerngross 2014). Jungle cat presence was recently recorded around the Büyük Menderes Delta, Aydin Province, in the Akyatan Wildlife Conservation and Development Area, Akyatan Lagoon, Adana Province, and close to Manavgat, Antalya Province (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014).&#160;However, its status in Turkey is not known (Avgan 2009). The Jungle Cat is found in the Caucasus mountains (up to 1,000 m) including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia. It occurs west and south of the Caspian Sea as well as south and east of the Aral Sea and associated river valleys, In Central Asia, it is found in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, possibly Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan. Its distribution extants into South Asia from western Pakistan through&#160;almost all of India as well as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal ranging up to 2,400 m in the Himalayan foothills. The Jungle Cat occurrs through Southeast Asia including Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos PDR and Vietnam, to southern China, but is absent from Malayan peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Its range in Indochina is poorly known, especially in Myanmar.  Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2005) reviewed the few historical distribution records from Indochina and added several recent ones from Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam.","Some illegal trade (and killing) continues in India (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010) and elsewhere in South Asia.",Terrestrial,"The Jungle Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II.  It is protected from hunting in some range states (India), but in many it receives no legal protection outside protected areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species now receives legal protection from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan after being placed on the country’s 2009 Protected Species List. Furthermore, given the amount of habitat loss occurring in riparian and wetland areas in Afghanistan, this species should be considered a research priority.<br/><br/>The ecology and status of the Jungle Cat is poorly known (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Southwest and Southeast Asia, where it is considered rare and declining, more research needs to be undertaken to gain knowledge of current distribution, both in and outside of protected areas (Abu-Baker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).  Some farmers consider the Jungle Cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), and conservation measures should include better protection for domestic fowl and halting of indiscriminate poisoning and trapping.  The Jungle Cat would also benefit from improved protection of natural wetlands and reedbeds, particularly in the more arid parts of its range, and improved legislation prohibiting fur trade.<br/><br/>The Jungle Cat was recorded in 13 protected areas in Iran (Sanei<em> <em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2016). There are recent Jungle Cat records from protected areas in India as from Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Andhar Pradesh, Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve, Biligri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve, Mundumalai Tiger Reserve and from Mana National Park (Behera and Borah 2010, Borah&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2012, Choudhury 2010, Kalle&#160;<em><em>et al.</em>&#160;</em>2013, Kumara&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014).&#160;In 2013, its presence was recorded in Chitwan National Park, Nepal (Lamichhane <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2014). There are also a number of recent records from protected areas from eastern Cambodia such as from the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Channa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Gray <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014) as well as from Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand (Borries and Koenig 2014) and from the Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar (Linnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> no date).&#160;However, all protected areas in Cambodia are insufficiently managed and threatened by habitat loss, degradation, and hunting.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50655874,12521,Lynx rufus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bobcat is listed as Least Concern because it is abundant and wide-ranging and is not suspected to be declining at a rate that would qualify it for Near Threatened. Bobcats are widely-distributed and their current range consists of most of the United States, southern Canada, and Mexico where the state of Oaxaca remains the southern-most limit for the species. However, local threats may present challenges for long term persistence in some regions including market hunting for the fur trade, direct habitat loss caused by increased urbanization, and indirect effects of urbanization such as genetic isolation and lethal/sublethal exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (southern California). Florida is the only US state to report Bobcat declines with Bobcat observations decreasing dramatically as invasive pythons have increased in the southern part of the state. Additionally, some concern exists about sustainability of current bag limits with the increasing value of Bobcat pelts (West Virginia). Other local threats include possible disease transmission (canine distemper in Bobcats in eastern Canada), direct conflict with domestic/feral animals including feral dogs (northern Mexico), and poisoning and medicinal uses of Bobcats (central and southern Mexico). Bobcat densities are low in central and southern, compared to northern, Mexico. The recent discovery of hybridization between the Bobcat and the sympatric Canadian Lynx may result in conservation actions for the endangered lynx recovery.","In the US, the Bobcat ranges through a wide variety of habitats, including boreal coniferous and mixed forests in the north, bottomland hardwood forest and coastal swamp in the southeast, and desert and scrubland in the southwest. Only large, intensively cultivated areas appear to be unsuitable habitat. Areas with dense understory vegetation and high prey density are most intensively selected by Bobcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The requisite features of Bobcat habitat typically include areas with abundant rabbit and rodent populations, dense cover, and shelters that function as escape cover or den sites (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Mexico, Bobcats are found in dry scrub and grassland, as well as tropical dry forest including pine, oak and fir (Monroy-Vilchis and Velazquez 2003, Arzate <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, C. Lopez-Gonzalez pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/>Like its close relative <em>Lynx canadensis</em> the Bobcat preys primarily on lagomorphs (rabbits), but is much less of a specialist. Rodents are commonly taken, and Bobcats are capable of taking larger prey, including young ungulates (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A study in Virginia found Bobcats preyed on a wide variety of species (15 total) including squirrels, chipmunks, white-tailed deer, voles, and rabbits, appearing to switch prey seasonally as certain prey items became more available (Montague 2014, Morin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in review).<br/><br/>Bobcats in New Hampshire appear to favour areas with few roads, limited human development, high stream densities, and steep topography (Broman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Similarly, Bobcats in Vermont have positive responses to shrub, wetland, deciduous, and coniferous cover types, and negative responses to road and mixed cover types, and Bobcats prefer to move through forested land and scrub/rock cover rather than move through developed land cover types (Donovan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). The recently re-established Bobcats in Iowa showed a strong preference for forest over any other habitat type (Reding <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Tucker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In Virginia, Bobcats were also shown to occur more often father away from roads (Kelly and Holub 2008). So while Bobcats can adjust to some levels of human encroachment, studies support the preference of Bobcats for vegetative cover and water in areas away from roads. Bobcat populations have been shown to decline in areas where forests have matured and no longer support abundant prey, namely cottontails (Litvaitis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Additionally, in Texas, when in the presence of Ocelots, Bobcats selected areas with &lt;75% canopy cover, likely facilitating coexistence between the two predators and demonstrating the Bobcat’s flexibility in habitat selection (Horne <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Alternatively, another study has shown the Bobcat will expand its use of different environmental features and use of marginal habitat in the presence of Canada Lynx (Peers <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2009) gathered home range information from 29 Bobcat populations across the US and found that on average, males maintained home ranges 1.65 times the size of females. Female home ranges were 0.989–42.7 km² with a mean of 15.83 km² compared to male home ranges of 2.86– 167.9 km² with a mean of 39.70 km². Females demonstrated a strong positive association between home-range size and productivity (i.e. food availability), whereas males were influenced more by changes in size of female home ranges than by resource availability (Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009, Sandell 1989).","World demand for Bobcat fur rose gradually in the late 1960s and early 1970s and jumped in the mid-1970s after CITES entered into force, when the pelts of cats listed on Appendix I became legally unobtainable for the commercial fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013,&#160; $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. <br/><br/>The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana <em>et al.</em> 2010, Tracey <em>et al.</em> 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160; Riley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2009, Serieys <em>et al.</em> 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Croteau <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007). &#160;<br/><br/>There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi <em>et al.</em> 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton <em>et al.</em> (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani <em>et al.</em> 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne <em>et al.</em> 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers <em>et al.</em> 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (<em>Lynx canadensis</em>) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack <em>et al.</em> 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas.&#160; Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011). &#160;<br/><br/>In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010).","In 2010, Roberts and Crimmins surveyed state wildlife management agencies in each of the 48 contiguous states regarding the current population status of Bobcats. Populations were reported to be stable or increasing in 40 states, with six states unable to report population trends and only one state (Florida) reporting decreases in Bobcat populations. The total Bobcat population for the US is estimated to be between 2,352,276 to 3,571,681 individuals, indicating that Bobcat populations have increased throughout the majority of their range in North America since the late 1990s. In particular, Bobcat populations have rebounded in the Midwestern states in recent decades. Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Five Canadian provinces reported stable Bobcat populations, one reported a stable or increasing population, and one reported a fluctuating population. Bobcat population sizes and status in Mexico are not well known.<br/><br/>Despite being widespread, there are only a few estimates for the densities that bobcats can attain. Density estimates include: 57-62 / 100km² in California (Alonso <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), 48/100 km² in Texas (Heilbrun <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), 25/100 km² in Arizona (Lawhead 1984), &lt;9/100 km² in Idaho (Knick 1990), and 11/100 km² in Virginia (minimum estimate, M. Kelly and D. Morin pers. comm. 2015). Bobcat densities in the northern parts of their range are generally lower than in the south (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A density estimate for Bobcats in Mexico was low, at five individuals per 100 km² (Arzate <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Bobcat densities can vary dramatically depending on site and Thornton and Perkins (2015) found that densities in Texas were lowest in the most heavily modified landscape, and that Bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover.",Stable,"Bobcats occur in southern Canada and throughout the United States and Mexico. In Canada, Bobcats appear to be extending their range northward as forest clearing occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Recent confirmation of Bobcats via remote camera, suggests Bobcat range extends further into the Canadian Rocky Mountains than previously thought (Lobo and Millar 2010). In the United States, bobcats were thought to be extirpated by the early 1900s from several Midwestern states including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri, due to habitat loss and exploitation (Lariviére and Walton 1997), but they have recently recolonized these areas (Roberts and Crimmins 2010). Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Bobcats are found throughout Mexico, particularly in western Mexico and southward from the Sonoran desert. Competitive interactions with ecologically similar felids could be a factor in limiting their southern distribution, but similar competitors are present in other areas of Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Thus, the absence of<em> Lynx rufus</em> below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be due to the absence of prey species. However, confirmative data of Bobcat presence throughout Mexico is somewhat scanty. While Bobcat range is thought to stop at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Gonzalez-Salazar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), this is based on habitat modeling rather than verified confirmations. While generally favoring low and mid-elevations, in the western US, Bobcat have been trapped at elevations up to 2,575 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Mexico, radio-collared Bobcats were located at 3,500 m on the Colima Volcano in western Mexico (Burton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).","For information on use and trade , see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II. The Mexican subspecies <em>Lynx rufus escuinapae</em> was listed on CITES Appendix I until 1992, when it was downlisted to Appendix II on the grounds that it is not a valid taxon (Govt of US 2007). Bobcats are legally harvested for the fur trade in 38 US states, and in seven Canadian provinces. In Mexico, the Bobcat is legally hunted in small numbers as a trophy animal (Govt of US 2007). There appears to be little illegal international trade (Govt of US 2007), although within the US, Millions and Swanson (2006) used molecular forensics techniques to determine that skins reported as originating from an area with a higher bag limit were probably illegally taken from an area with a lower limit.<br/><br/>Bobcat status in the mid-western United States has improved since their extirpation in the early 1900s. In Iowa, Bobcats were downgraded to threatened in 2001 and are now harvested in many counties. In Illinois, Bobcats were removed from the states’ list of&#160; threatened in 1999 and they are now found in nearly all counties. Indiana has sightings in much of the state and Bobcats were downgraded to special concern in 2005. In Ohio, the Bobcat is still classified as an endangered species and provided full protection.<br/><br/>Reintroduction of Bobcats to Cumberland Island, Georgia was highly successful (Diefebach <em>et al.</em> 2013) suggesting Bobcats can do well when protected. In addition, Kapfer and Potts (2012) found Bobcat harvest in Minnesota could be predicted by season length and suggest population densities can be manipulated by change in length of hunting season.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

They prefer hills, undulating terrain and gentle slopes, but also use cliffs. Urials occur in grasslands and open woodlands, e.g., of almond<em> Amygdalus sp.</em>, pistachio <em>Pistacia</em> <em>sp. </em>and juniper <em>Juniperus sp.</em>, as well as cold deserts with scarce vegetation dominated by subshrubs. Urial may also forage at crop fields. They use cavities in slopes or cliffs for shelter or rest under shrubs. <br/><br/>Urial are gregarious with group sizes reaching more than hundred individuals, where local population sizes is sufficiently large. The average Urial group size in Golestan National Park, Iran with over 4,000 individuals was around 29 individuals (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Urial densities were higher (21.77 vs. 0.15 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) near ranger stations, which provide protection from poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Herds are smaller and often sexually segregated during spring and summer. They are sexually dimorphic, non-territorial and promiscuous. The reproductive cycle begins with the rut in late November. Females give birth to one or less often two lambs (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2019) in April-June. Rut and lambing periods vary between different parts of the range. Main predators are large felid and canid carnivores and occasionally golden eagle on lambs (Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016). Females typically give first birth after two years, males are sexually mature at three years, but are fully mature at eight years. Maximum lifespan in the wild is 11 years (Baskin and Danell 2003). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal</em><br/></strong>The plateau Ustyurt and Mangyshlak peninsula represent clay deserts at elevations of 150-175 m asl. The climate is sharply continental. Sheep inhabit clay and Cretaceous cliffs (“chinks”) and ravines or hill slopes of a different steepness. Males prefer more open parts of a relief whereas females and young animals are attracted to the broken relief (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>Habitats of the Tajik Urial are characterized by aridity and continental climate. This subspecies occurs at altitudes between 500 and 2,200 m asl. It prefers the pistachio woodlands or other shrubs located on hilly watersheds of low ridges with obligatory presence of deep gorges with steep slopes (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>Afghan Urial usually use rounded, broken mountain terrain, plateau, gentle slopes and hills with gorges and at lower altitudes between 600 and 2,500 m, in southern Pakistan below 1,200 m asl but readily access precipitous terrain as escape cover. Most habitats are open woodlands with some shrub vegetation, but they occur as well in degraded habitats (Groves and Leslie 2011, Fedosenko 2002). In the Hazarajat, Afghanistan, local people have indicated that Urials appear to remain permanently within some specific areas and move throughout these with predictable seasonal migrations. There are two major migrations – one into the lambing areas in late May and one into the rutting area in mid-November. Rutting behaviour occurs from mid-December to mid-January (WCS Afghanistan 2014; <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em><br/></strong>The habitat of Punjab Urial is the scrub forest in Salt and Kala Chitta Ranges. In the Salt Range it is typically associated with lower rounded stony hills sparsely covered with wild olive <em>Olea ferruginea</em> and phulai <em>Acacia modesta</em>. The distribution of the subspecies in Pakistan is between the Indus and Jhelum rivers at elevations of 250-1,500&#160;m. The reproductive cycle begins with the rut in mid-October and November with a peak of activity in the first half of November. Females give birth to one or two lambs in early April. Main predators are leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> and jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>The habitats of this form are relatively gentle slopes at high altitudes of more than 2,500 m, up to 4,000 m asl. and more, characterized by aridness, severity of climate and semi-desert vegetation with scarce forage and almost complete lack of shrubs (Fedosenko 2002, Siraj-Ud-Din <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Ladakh, Urial primarily use rolling and moderately steep slopes along the lower portion of the Indus and Shyok valleys, rarely using the steeper mid and higher elevation areas occupied by ibex and blue sheep (Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2010). Increasingly however, Urials seem to be taking refuge in possibly suboptimal steep areas in the lower valleys as the gentler ones are coming under different land use (Raghavan <em>et al</em>. 2003, Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006).</p>","<p>Overall, this species is threatened mainly by poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a, 2019), competition with livestock on forage, space and disease spillover risk and predation of lambs by shepherd dogs. Urials avoid rugged mountainous terrain where it might gain some protection, and is thus particularly prone to poaching, competes for food directly with livestock that seasonally shares its habitat and is threatened by infectious diseases transmitted by sheep and goats. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal</em><br/></strong>Poaching was the cause of the latest decline in the ex-Soviet republics. It was carried out by locals, especially around the limited waterholes used by the Urial, using both firearms and snares (Fedosenko 1986, Gorbunov 1986). Fedosenko and Weinberg (1999) reported excessive (trophy) hunting and intensive livestock grazing as threats in the Northern Aktau (Kazakhstan). In the Aktau-Buzachin Nature Reserve, Kazakhstan, Frisina (2002) found that historical overgrazing, which had ceased about ten years before his survey has caused serious habitat degradation, still affected the condition of the Urial. Given recovery of the livestock numbers in Kazakhstan (see <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TA"">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TA</a>) a serious risk of increasing overgrazing can be assumed. During the last two decades, poaching became more and more common, with the growth of extractive industries in the Mangystau Province and people having access to modern firearms and off-road vehicles as well as drones, which are used for detecting and chasing Urials in the narrow cliffs they inhabit. Extractive industries with road development and seismic exploration cause habitat fragmentation and disturbance.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>The decrease in numbers is attributed to commercial hunting during the Soviet Union, poaching and competition with domestic livestock, coupled with droughts and severe winters. Some key habitats in Babatag and Hazratishoh have been affected by the civil war in Tajikistan (1992-1997) when poaching was totally uncontrolled. Poaching had also been attributed to border violations from Afghanistan (Michel, 2010). Newborn lambs are captured as pets but the impact on the population is not known. In Tajikistan, Urial have been kept in a large enclosure together with European mouflons <em>O. aries</em> (media reports, R. Muratov, pers. comm. 2018), thus potentially risking hybridization and in case of escapes genetic pollution of the wild population.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, poaching of Urial is reported to be still commonplace in the Urial habitat. Some Urials also become habituated to grazing barley fields and are shot (WCS Afghanistan 2014, <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). Capture of lambs indicated the existence of a Urial population east of Kabul in 2015. In Iran, the main threat to ungulates is rampant poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Poaching usually happens by local communities or by people from bigger cities with the guidance of locals. The main incentives for poaching in Golestan National Park have been identified as subsistence, pleasure, tradition, trade of wild meat, and conflict with conservation regulations and bodies (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Disease transmitted by livestock could also be of serious threat to Urials. In 2011, Peste des Petits Ruminants virus was the suspected cause of 550-700 deaths among Urial in Sarigol National Park (Marashi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Other threats such as habitat loss, competition with livestock, diseases and climate change are of importance for this species in Iran. In Pakistan, poaching, livestock overgrazing, and habitat degradation caused by fuelwood gathering and by agriculture, are the main threats to this Urial. Afghan Urial may be more susceptible to such threats than are wild goats <em>Capra sp.</em> inhabiting the same areas because of species-specific differences in habitat preferences (Edge and Olson-Edge 1987). Throughout its range in Baluchistan, Urial faces severe poaching pressure and competition from domestic sheep and goat, and lives in extremely scattered and small populations (Virk 1991). In Turkmenistan, poaching is the main threat but there is also competition from domestic livestock for forage and water (Annabayramov 2011, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015, E. Rustamov, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabensis</em><br/></strong>The main threats for Punjab Uial are poaching, decline of habitat area because of agriculture, urbanization, roads and other human developments and loss of habitat in quality because of overgrazing by domestic livestock (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Arshad and Hussain 2018). Lambs are illegally taken at birth to be kept as pets (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in some areas almost 50% of the lambs are collected by poachers within one week of parturition (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015). They are a status symbol and although capture is illegal, the Pakistani government had been selling licences to keep Urial as pets (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2015) but it is not clear if this practice continues (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015) Some are hybridized with domestic sheep. Adult rams are poached for their trophy value. Apart from the protected population in the Kalabagh Game Reserve, the Punjab Urial suffers heavy poaching pressure and the remaining range of this species is under continuously increasing human pressure (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, forage competition and transmission of diseases from domestic animals are major threats. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>In the Wakhan and adjacent areas in Afghanistan poaching by local people is limited thanks to conservation efforts and customary hunting rules (S. Michel, own observations and stakeholder interviews 2008-2013). Poaching is currently on the rise in Afghanistan due to militarization of the area related to border guard deployment as a result of growing insecurity in Badakhshan Province (S. Ostrowksi, pers. comm. 2019). Community rangers in Wakhan have also reported that shepherd dogs are a danger to Urials during lambing season. Opportunistic poaching on Urials moving to Tajikistan may prevent recolonization there. Hunting is banned in India and has been relatively strictly controlled recently (especially in the Indus valley), but the Urial’s habitat is highly accessible and susceptible to overuse by livestock herding and other human activities (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006, Raghavan <em>et al</em>. 2003). Urials occupy the low, relatively accessible areas along the major valley corridors, all of which have, or soon will have, roads and expanding human settlements. The resulting effects of increased poaching and eventual human settlement associated with irrigation projects and increased livestock numbers will require effective conservation and management actions if Ladakh Urial is to survive (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1994, Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2018) reported that poaching by locals and security forces seems to be relatively common in Kargil. In Pakistan, most Urial habitat is close to human settlements and also not very steep, therefore easily accessible to poachers and for grazing by increasing numbers of livestock leading to widespread habitat degradation and displacement of Urial into marginal habitat (Siraj-Ud-Din <em>et al.</em> 2016). Compared to the highly priced markhor <em>Capra falconeri</em>, which is more numerous in several areas, Urial received less attention in community-based conservancies and authorities in Pakistan are reluctant to authorize regulated trophy hunting of Ladakh Urial because of its rarity and concerns over the engagement and capacity of beneficiary communities to protect the species (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020). In general, small size and high fragmentation of Urial populations may seriously impact their survival in India and Pakistan (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006).</span></p>","<p>The global population of this species might be in the range of 30,000 animals. The population numbers do not include suspected species hybrids between <em>O. gmelini </em>and <em>O. vignei</em>, occurring in Iran. Hereby, we considered entire provinces if not otherwise indicated. The population trend across its range is likely to be decreasing, probably as much as 30% over three generations.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arabica</em><br/></strong>No information is available about this population and if it is still extant.<em> <br/><br/><strong>Ovis vignei arkal</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>The total number estimated in ex-Soviet republics at the beginning of the 1990s was ca. 6,000 animals (Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). Numbers had declined sharply before the mid-1960s, when 3,000 were estimated for Kazakhstan, and continued to decline to 2,000 by the 1970s and 1,500 at the beginning of the 1980s (Lankin 1982; Savinov and Bekenov 1977). However, since the early 1990s the populations appear to have temporarily increased but more recently once more declined (see below paras about Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan). <br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, 130 urials were counted in the Karagiye Depression and 869 at the mesas of Northern Aktau in 1997 (Fedosenko and Weinberg 1999). In the Aktau-Buzachin Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan, during a survey in 2000 a total of 491 urials were observed, a density of 4 per km² in suitable habitat and providing the basis for an estimated population size of ~1400 animals (Frisina 2002). The Red Book of Kazakhstan (Bekenov, Kasabekov 2010) provided the following figures, indicating a massive decline: 1991 (5,500-5,600); 2000 (3,500);<span lang=""EN-US""> 2002 (2,000-2,500); and 2007 (700-1,000). In the protected areas, which cover most of the current habitat of the species, estimates in 2016 and 2017 yielded 1,354 and 1,514 animals, respectively, with the largest populations in Ustyurt State Strict Nature Reserve and in the Zhabayushkan reserve (Institute of Zoology, 2017). Similarly, the authorities of Mangystau Province for 2018 reported 1,550 animals. Local sources indicate, however, substantial local declines and extinctions. N. Ismailov (pers. comm., 2019) guessed a population of around 2,500 animals across the range in Kazakhstan in 2000 and suggested declines by more than 70% during the last 20 years (<em>ca</em> 1,150 in 2018/2019). <br/><br/>We present here all available population information for Iran under <em>O. v. cycloceros</em>, following Fedosenko (2002), who included all urials in Iran in this subspecies but considered only urials in Kazakhstan and northwestern Turkmenistan as <em>O. v. arkal</em>. <br/><br/>In the early 1980s, 800 were estimated in Turkmenistan, of which 500 were found along the shores of Kara-Bogaz Gol and 300 in the southern ravines (Zarkhidze 1983). Following protection resulting from its listing in the USSR Red Data Book, numbers of this subspecies began to increase in the latter half of the 1980s with some populations reestablishing themselves naturally. Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) reported 250 urials for the region of Kaplankyr and Kazakhly Shor and another 20 south of Kara-Bogaz-Gol, a substantial decline compared to 1,600 reported for the Turkmenistan part of the Ustyurt in the 1990s (Annabayramov 2011). <br/><br/>About 300 animals of this subspecies were thought to inhabit Uzbekistan in 1983 but numbers have since declined (O. Tsaruk, <em>in litt</em>. 1994), with ca. 40 near the border with Turkmenistan (B. Dyakin, pers. comm. to E. Mukhina 1995). In Uzbekistan, Central Asian Desert Initiative expeditions (2012-2014) recorded Urial&#160;observations, tracks and skulls north of Kazakhly Shor, northwest of Kaplankyr Strictly Protected Area, along the western shore of Sarykamysh Lake and northwest of it. Based on 52 direct observations and 72 individuals identified on camera traps overall numbers might be in the range of 100 animals (Marmazinskaya <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Ovis vignei bocharensis</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Numbers have fluctuated slightly since the 1970s (Frolov and Golub 1983; Luzhevsky 1977), and by the late 1980s the total number estimated was only 1,000 animals (Prisyazhniuk 1990). However, Sokov (1993) mentioned &gt;1,000 for Tajikistan alone, so together with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan there might have been up to some 1,200 animals. Numbers are believed to be decreasing, and in some areas, populations are very small. For example, in Uzbekistan on the western slopes of the Kugitangtau on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, there were as few as 100 individuals (B. Dyakin Department of Hunting Management, Uzbekistan pers. comm. to E. Mukhina), with only five counted in May 1993 in the Surkhan Nature Reserve (Chernogaev <em>et al.</em> 1995). Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) observed 36 animals at the Turkmenistan side of the mountain range, in Koytendag Strict Nature reserve. Numbers might have recovered since as Kholikov (pers. comm., 2014) in 2013 recorded 45 urials in Surkhan Strictly Protected Area in Uzbekistan. Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) assumes that about 250 urials exist at the Turkmenistan part of the mountain range. <br/><br/>In the Uzbekistan part of the Babatag Mountains at the border with Tajikistan in the early 2000s about 40 Bukhara urials were assumed to exist and Normatov (2016) mentioned that locals until around 2012 annually caught about 10 urial lambs as pets. Since then such information is missing, possibly indicating a massive decline in the population numbers. Urial is known from the nearby Aktau range in Tajikistan, which hosts a population of likely more than 100 urials (Michel, various local reports, own observations 2018). <br/><br/>For Tajikistan, the country with the largest population of the subspecies, reliable data on overall urial numbers in the past and present are not available. Figures for specific areas vary largely. Baskin and Daniell (2003) provide numbers ranging from 820 to 1,550 individuals for the three range areas Surkhkuh, Hazratishoh and Karatau. Surveys in the frame of the Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project since 2008 yielded much lower numbers (Garibmamadov and Amirov 2015, Michel 2014); most recent in 2014: Southern Hazratishoh Range 31, Panj Karatau 10 and Aktau 117 and Surkhkuh 16. Further animals are known from unsurveyed areas in Baljuvan and the Babatag Range in the immediate border region with Uzbekistan. The total population in Tajikistan is likely substantially below 500 animals. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan no numbers are available for the overall population or certain locations. Despite local people have indicated that Urial&#160;remain numerous in certain areas of the Hazarajat Plateau, discussions with hunters and other communities suggested a significant decrease in numbers and even their local extirpation (WCS Afghanistan 2014; Afghanistan.wcs.org, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/>In Iran, the population was estimated to be at least 20,000 animals in the mid-1970s (Valdez and DeForge 1985), of which around 10,000-15,000 were estimated to inhabit Golestan National Park alone (Kiabi 2004, Decker and Kowalski 1972). However, a scientific population assessment in 2013/2014 using line transects and Distance sampling in this national park showed around 66% decline in urial population compared to 1970s (4,275 individuals 95% confidence interval 2,117-8,632; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). A comparable or even more severe decline in the population of urial in a similar time window is anticipated for other protected areas (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2019). The density of urial in Golestan National Park was around 12.57 individuals/km² (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Recent population estimates by Iranian Department of Environment from protected areas do not distinguish between urial, mouflon and hybrids. The total of figures from annual census by Department of Environment for the protected areas in the provinces with only <em>O. vignei</em> occurring (i.e., Golestan, North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchistan) in 2009 was approx. 13,000 and in the census of 2016 yielded around 18,000 individuals (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, there may be more <em>O. vignei</em> populations in provinces of Kerman, Semnan, and Yazd adding up to around 11,000 additional urials to the total population (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, due to the uncertainty in the presence of urial, hybrids with mouflon or both in these provinces, we refrain from reporting these numbers in the urial global population. <br/><br/>No total population census based on surveys is available for Pakistan. In the past, Roberts (1985) estimated that perhaps 2,500 to 3,000 Afghan urial lived in Baluchistan, with 1,000 (0.2/km²) inhabiting the Torghar hills of Toba Kakar range (District Zhob) according to Mitchell (1988), about 150 in the Takatu hills near Quetta (A. Ahmad, unpubl. Data), and more in the Dureji hills, District Zhob (Virk, 1991). Malik (1987) estimated a total of 310 to 340 Afghan urial for the whole of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (former North West Frontier Province (NWFP)), whereas the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) reported a total of only 80 urial (68 from Kohat, two from Mardan and 10 from Abbottabad), suggesting a severe decline over five years. For Sindh Province, a census carried out by Mirza and Asghar (1980) estimated a population of 430 urial for Kirthar National Park. Based on a census in the Mari-Lusar-Manghtar range and in the Karchat mountains in 1987, K. Bollmann (unpubl. data) estimated between 800 and 1,000 urial (0.26-0.32/km²) for the whole of Kirthar NP. About 150 to 200 animals lived in the Mari-Lusar-Manghtar range, and 100 to 150 in the Karchat mountains; i.e., 1.7 to 2.5 urial/km² (Edge and Olson-Edge, 1987). In Dureji Game Management Area, Baluchistan Province, Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2006) observed 504 urials and produced a population estimate of 858. During the fall survey 2008 Arshad and Khan (2009) estimated a population of 1,637 urials for the Torghar Conservation Project area, with substantial differences between high quality habitat (4.44/km²) and low quality areas (1.06/km²), and showing an overall decline, particularly in the buffer areas. In 2017, Shah Noorani Game Reserve in Baluchistan reported a population of 2,500 to 3,000 animals in 2016/2017. The Conservator Wildlife &amp; National Parks of Baluchistan, (A. Ali, pers. comm. 2019), reported for Hingol National Park and five community game reserves a total of 9,700 to 11,750 urial, with 3,000 in Torghar, but only 1,500 to 2,000 in Shah Noorani. An article on the website <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.tribune.com.pk"">www.tribune.com.pk</a> in January 2020 stated that 14,000 urials exist in protected areas in Sindh, including Halalo, Pachran, Uth Palan and Mol, but the figures could not be verified from official sources. <br/><br/>The estimate for the total population in Turkmenistan in the late 1980s and early 1990s was between 10,000 and 12,000 urials (Korshunov 1995). Numbers then had increased slightly from the estimates of 8,000 to 10,000 made in the 1970s (Babaev <em>et al.</em> 1978), when there were 2,000 in the Kopet-Dagh Reserve, with about 1,500 in the Badkhyz Reserve (Gorelov 1978). A significant decline in numbers was reported for the period until the late 1990s in the eastern Kopet Dagh and in Badkhyz, with only 150 to 200 in Big Balkhan and 300 to 350 in the western Kopet Dagh (V. Lukarevskiy, in lit., 1994); about 2500 – 2800 in the Eastern Kopet Dagh and about 3500 – 4000 for Turkmenistan in total, with a declining trend (Lukarevskiy <em>et al.</em> 2010). Rapid declines happened during the last decade, with Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) reporting an overall decline from around 4,000 in 2010 (Annabayramov 2011) to less than 1,600 and local declines by up to 60%. The larger share of these animals still occurs within protected areas, while outside of them urial exist mainly in relatively low densities. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em><br/></strong>Schaller (1977) estimated a total world population of ~2,000 Punjab urial and a complete census made in 1976-77 by Mirza <em>et al</em>. (1979) estimated 2,157. Estimates by Chaudhry (unpubl. data) in 1992, gave a minimum total population of 1,550 throughout its whole range. For Punjab, Chaudhry <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported a significant decline in urial numbers over only one year; from 733 in 1986 to 528 in 1987. A total of only 12 were reported for Chinji National Park (Chaudhry and Sarwar, 1988). Awan <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated a total population of about 860 urial in the Salt Range, suggesting a 56% decline from 1976, when Mirza <em>et al.</em> (1980) estimated 1,968 urial in the same area. Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2001) recorded 259 urials in Kalabagh Game Reserve in the Salt Range. Awan <em>et al.</em> (2006) found that this area was the last remaining stronghold for wild ungulates in the Punjab Province, while in neighboring unprotected areas in the Eastern Salt Range poaching, in particular of newborn lambs, caused a decline. Arshad and Hussain (2018) suggested some recovery in Jhelum District in Punjab, based on distance sampling of five sites in 2007, but did not estimate the population size. Khan <em>et al.</em> (2015) surveyed five sections of the Soan valley in the Salt Range and estimated a population of 110 urials (1.39/km²). A media article in November 2019 claimed that surveys revealed increases in the population of Punjab urial (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2093549/1-survey-punjabs-urial-population-completed/"">https://tribune.com.pk/story/2093549/1-survey-punjabs-urial-population-completed/</a>). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, the population in the Wakhan National Park might be attributed to this subspecies. The population in Wakhan was estimated stable between 2011 and 2015 and Moheb <em>et al.</em> (2012) recorded 400 urial there. However, results of sample counts carried out in 2018 may suggest a population decline compared to 2015 of as much as 30% (S. Ostrowski, pers comm. 2020). Simms <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported observations of 260 urials from the neighboring districts Ishkashim and Zebak. <br/><br/>The total population of <em>O. v. vignei</em> in India was previously estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,500 animals (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983, 1991), in a range spread over less than 2,000 km² (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). The Ladakh urial had declined dramatically in the last 60 years, especially during the military conflicts between 1947 and 1962 (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983). Raghavan <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the urial population in surveyed areas in Ladakh in 2002 to number around 690 (540-840) individuals. During a study in 2002-2003 in total 834 individuals were recorded (not including off-trail sightings). The Nindum-Fotula area, followed by Likir and Hemis Shukpachen had the highest proportion of urial sightings. As urial habitat overlaps with the areas of land use for livestock grazing, crop cultivation and infrastructure development, Raghavan <em>et al.</em> (2003) concluded that “it is unlikely that urial population in Ladakh is increasing. In fact, it seems more probable that they are actually facing, if not already on, a decline.” A recent survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimated 753 urial within 625 km² of surveyed area in Upper Shyam and Kargil landscapes. Density estimates from about 70 km² area in the Fotu La region of Kargil landscape had been nearly four times higher in 2003 (Raghavan <em>et al.</em> 2003), indicating that urial population may have suffered drastic decline in the areas bordering Kargil and Leh Districts. The Kargil and Upper Shyam landscapes seem to be supporting the last refuges of relatively large populations of urial in Ladakh currently. In rest of Leh and Kargil districts, urial was found to be scattered in small populations (Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>According to some reports from around 1900, <em>O. v. vignei</em> used to be a common animal of northern Pakistan. Schaller (1976) estimated that &lt; 1,000 were left in Pakistan and Roberts (1985) gave “intelligent guesses” of 500 to 600 animals for Baltistan and 700 to 800 for Gilgit-Hunza. All these estimates are much greater than more recent numbers. Hess (1990) estimated the total population of <em>O. v. vignei</em> in Pakistan for 1987-88 to be only 200 to 400 animals. In 1992, a total of 57 urial were estimated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP, 1992); 29 in Dir and 28 in Chitral. The total estimated for the Gilgit-Baltistan (former Northern Areas) for 1993 was 400 to 500 urial (G. Tahir, Wildlife Wing, Northern Areas Forest Dept., in lit. to G. Rasool). Khan and Zahler (2004) saw only one herd of 13 animals and gathered reports on observations by local hunters and herders; they concluded that small scattered populations existed in southern Gilgit and Diamir districts. Siraj-ud-Din <em>et al.</em> (2016) from January to September 2013 in Gilgit-Baltistan recorded a directly observed minimum population of 172 individuals, and estimated the overall population comprising <em>ca</em> 432 individuals (4.79 urial/km²) taking into account local information as collected through questionnaires. They found the population being declining and have been extirpated from at least six previously known localities during the last decade. Surveys carried out by the Wildlife Conservation Society between winters 2018 and 2019 tallied minimal numbers ranging 62 to 146 in Bunji, where Siraj-ud-Din in 2013 had observed 109 animals, and 5 to 8 animals both in Nanga Parbat and Doyan. Information from other areas in Baltistan, Nagar and District Gilgit support less than 50 animals in total, but several areas have not been investigated for decades. Overall the remaining population of urial in Gilgit-Baltistan is likely less than 350 individuals in 2019 (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Afghanistan, northwestern India (Ladakh), central and eastern Iran, southwestern Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Wild sheep reported from Oman (where it has possibly been introduced) have been considered as urial. In Iran, following Rezaei <em>et al</em>. (2010) (and unlike Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016 or Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019, which assigned the Ovis in all areas to either of the two species), we considered a zone of occurrence of hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em>. The exact extent of this hybrid zone and the status of certain populations of wild sheep there are uncertain. Therefore, we opted for the most conservative scenario at the province level (due to data limitations) and delineate the species boundaries accordingly. We considered the easternmost provinces (i.e., Golestan, North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchistan) as the 'confirmed' range of urial as we had higher certainty about urial presence. We suspect that, for example, Kerman or parts of Semnan provinces could also be included in urial range, but we opted for being more conservative as higher phenotypic diversity in wild sheep in these provinces is observable. Our tentative hybrid zone is also included in the description of the geographic range in this assessment and mapped as 'Presence Uncertain' with a note that there is a higher possibility of hybridization in this area.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arabica</em> (Arabian or Oman Urial)</strong><br/>There is no recent information available on the occurrence of wild sheep in the Jebal-Akhdar mountains in northern Oman, which had been attributed to urial (Fedosenko, 2002). This population is not mentioned by Damm and Franco (2014), it is unknown if it still exists and what its origin (autochthonous or introduced) had been (S. Ross, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal </em>(Ustyurt or Transcaspian Urial or Arkal)</strong><br/>The distribution range of this subspecies is not clearly delimitated from the range of <em>O. v. cycloceros</em>. Groves and Grubb (2011) merge both subspecies in one species, but distinguish two subspecies. They consider the urial in Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran as belonging to this subspecies. Other sources (e.g., Fedosenko 2002) distinguish the urial in the Large and Small Balkhan and Kopet-Dagh mountain ranges in Turkmenistan and further to the south in northeastern Iran as <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> and consider only the urial in the Ustyurt as <em>O. v. arkal</em>. Following the latter determination, the subspecies is found in southwest Kazakhstan, northwest Turkmenistan and northwest Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan) where it inhabits the western part of the Ustyurt plateau north and east of Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf, including Kaplankyr Plateau, Kazakhly-Sor, the low mountains on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and other areas with cliffs and ravines in Mangystau Province. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>The Bukhara urial occurs in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is found north of the Amu Darya and Panj rivers, where it inhabits the Kugitang and Baisuntau mountains, the Babatagh, Aktau and Panj Karatau ranges, the Surkhkuh, the Vakhsh range on the east bank of the Vakhsh river and the Hazratishoh Range (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, urial populations were known to occur throughout the Hindu Kush and the mountains of central Afghanistan, extending from the Zebak mountains in the north to the Seyah Koh range in the southwest. Urial occurred in the Ajar Valley Reserve, from where animals were known to migrate into distant valleys near the Band-e Amir National Park (both in Bamiyan Province). Its presence was established in Zebak area during 1976 surveys, but it was not known how far the species ranged into Badakhshan Province. In the east of Kabul, the urial was found in the Kohe Safi region of Kapisa Province (Petocz 1973). Specimens collected from hunters show that its range extended towards the Lataband Pass area near Kabul. Pictures of two captured urial lambs, kept in Khak-e Jabbar and reports by local people confirmed that the species was still extant there in 2015 (A. Kh. Khaurin, pers. comm. 2017). Other photographed poached animals in 2015 also confirmed its presence in Takhar Province (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020). The subspecies was also reported from the Safed Koh range in Herat and Badghis Provinces. Wildlife Conservation Society surveys since 2006 have confirmed urial presence within the Bamyan Plateau bounded roughly by Band-e-Amir, Saighan, Ajar Valley, southern Samangan, southeastern Saripul and Yakawlang-Sulej, although numbers are very low or even absent altogether in parts of their previous range within Badakhshan and the eastern forests (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/>In Iran, this subspecies (often referred as subspecies <em>O. v. arkal</em>) occurs in rolling hills and on gentle mountain slopes in the eastern country. There are remarkable populations in protected areas of the northeastern country including Golestan National Park, Sarigol National Park, Serany Protected Area and Tandureh National Park (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2018, Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019, Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016, Yousefi <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>For Pakistan, a distribution map for urial in the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) is given by Malik (1987), showing its scattered occurrence in the Districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Northern Waziristan, Karak, Kohat, Orakzai, Kurram, Peshawar, Mardan, Abbottabad, and Swat. According to the report by Roberts (1985) in Baluchistan <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> were widely distributed up to 2,750 m on gentler slopes of the major mountain ranges. The Conservator Wildlife &amp; National Parks of Baluchistan confirmed urial occurrence in protected areas for Hingol National Park, and the community game reserves Torghar, Dureiji, Shah Noorani, Baran Lakh and Talo Band (A. Ali, pers. comm. 2019). In Sindh, the Afghan urial occurs in the Kirthar mountains, especially in the Mari-Mangthar range (District Karachi) and in Dumbar, Kambuh and Karchat mountains (District Dadu) (Virk 1991). <br/><br/>The subspecies is found in Turkmenistan, where its distribution stretches south-eastwards in scattered populations from the Large (about 39°40’N and 54°30’E) and Small Balkhan mountains north of Nebit-Dagh, through the Kopet-Dagh mountains, in the mountains on the right bank of the Tejen, in an area between the Kushka and Murgab rivers, and in the ravines and rolling hills of Namansaar, Yer Oilanduz (Badkhyz) as far east as Southern Karabil (about 36°20’N and 64°30’N) (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em></strong> <br/>The distribution area of this subspecies in Pakistan is enclosed by the Indus and the Jhelum rivers and the forest belt of the Himalayan foothills. The taxonomic status of urial living along the west bank of the Indus, adjacent to the Punjab urial’s range, is uncertain (Schaller and Mirza, 1974). The subspecies is found in small scattered populations in the Kala Chitta and in the Salt range in Punjab Province up to 1,500 m a.s.l. Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported 14 subpopulations in two areas: Kala Chitta Range (estimated area of occupancy 100 km²) and Salt Range (estimated area of occupancy 1,265 km²). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>The taxonomic status of the urial population recently reported in Wakhan, Ishkashim and Zebak districts of Badakhshan, Afghanistan (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2009, Simms <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Baroghil National Park, Pakistan (Khurshid Ali Shah, pers. comm. 2019), and until the early 2000s in the southern slopes of Shakhdara Range at the right bank of Panj River (southwestern part of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, Tajikistan) (Luzhevsky 1977; Sapozhnikov 1976) is uncertain. These populations form scattered groups, isolated from the range area of <em>O. v. bochariensis</em> and possibly also from the range of <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> in Afghanistan, but likely connected to urial populations in the very northern part of Pakistan (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>In India, this subspecies occurs only in the Union Territory of Ladakh (erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir Province), where it is distributed discontinuously in a narrow band along the valley-bottom, to the foothill boundary of the Indus and Shyok-Nubra rivers, and some of their major tributaries. Most urial are found along the Indus valley westward from the village of Likchey to that of Khalsi, with additional herds around the junction of the Nubra and Shyok valleys (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983, 1991), where they appeared to be restricted between Panamik and Diskit (Bhatnagar &amp; Wangchuk 2001). Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2018) found urial scattered in small patches across the Leh District mainly along the Indus River and in Shyok-Nubra valley primarily along the right bank Shyok and Nubra rivers, with scattered populations along their left bank. Further, in Kargil District, urial seemed missing across vast areas of potential habitat but distribution was highly clustered in Heniskot and Takmachik areas. One of the best areas for urial in Ladakh was the Nindum-Fotula area where herds of close to <em>ca.</em> 100 urial were reported (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, Schaller (1977) and Roberts (1985) gave the major river valleys of the Kunar, Chitral river, Indus, Gilgit river and Shyok as the main range of Ladakh urial. Ladakh urial is still widely distributed, mainly in Gilgit-Baltistan, but only in very small isolated populations. In Khyber-Pakhtunkwa, Chitral District, it still inhabited the right bank of the Kunar river, from Chitral southwards to Drosh (Anonymous, 1986). Localities on the east bank of the Kunar river, as well as from north of Chitral (Anonymous 1986; Zool. Surv. Dept., 1987) were not confirmed. Michel <em>et al.</em> (2009) quote reports from local people about urial presence in the upper Yarkhun Valley, close to the border with Afghanistan at Baroghil Pass. In Gilgit-Baltistan, Gilgit District, Hess (1990) was able to locate only one locality where urial survived in 1985-86; reliable informants indicated a population of around 27 animals on the right side of the lower Miatsil river (Hispar valley). Khan and Zahler (2004) confirmed the existence of small populations of Ladakh urial in southern Gilgit and Diamer districts Along with Siraj-ud-Din <em>et al.</em> (2016), which more recently confirmed the species’ presence mainly in Bunji, and also in Nanga Parbat, Nagar and Skardu areas. <br/><br/><strong><em>Hybrid populations</em><br/></strong>The hybrid population, Alborz red sheep (<em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em> x <em>Ovis vignei arkal/cycloceros</em>) (Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1978) occurs in north-central Iran in the Alborz Mountains in Tehran and Alborz provinces (Varjin Protected Area, Central Alborz Protected Area, Khojir National Park, Sorkheh Hesar National Park), east to the Parvar Protected Area and south into the Kavir National Park. The exact western, eastern and southern limits of its distribution are undetermined, but generally sheep in central Alborz Mountains are considered as belonging to this hybrid form. <br/><br/>The Kerman sheep occurring east of 55°E in the Khabr National Park and Baft mountains in Kerman Province has been suggested to be a hybrid population (<em>Ovis vignei cycloceros [blanfordti]</em> x <em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em>). (Valdez 2008).<br/><br/>Hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em> may occur also in other areas of Iran, including the provinces central and northern Fars, eastern Hormozgan, eastern Isfahan, Qom, eastern Semnan, and Yazd.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Ovis vignei</em> has been listed on CITES Appendix I (<em>O. v. vignei</em>) and II (all other subspecies). Between COP 17 (2016) and COP 18 (2019) <em>O. vignei</em> had been listed in Appendix I as <em>O. aries vignei</em>, and in Appendix II as <em>Ovis aries </em>[except the subspecies included in Appendix I, the subspecies <em>O. a. isphahanica</em>, <em>O. a. laristanica</em>, <em>O. a. musimon</em> and <em>O. a. orientalis</em>, which are not included in the Appendices, and the domesticated form <em>O. a. aries</em>, which is not subject to the provisions of the Convention]). At CITES COP18 (2019) the Parties decided to divert from Wilson and Reeder 2005 and adopted as standard reference the taxonomy of the genus <em>Ovis</em> in Valdez and Weinberg (2011), leading to the listing of <em>O. vignei</em> as several species: <em>O. v. vignei</em> as <em>O. vignei</em> in Appendix I and all other subspecies as <em>O. arabica</em>, <em>O. arkal</em>, <em>O. bochariensis</em>, <em>O. cycloceros</em>, and <em>O. punjabiensis</em> (CITES 2020).<br/><br/>In Afghanistan, Urial reside seasonally or permanently in Bamyan Plateau Protected Area, Wakhan National Park and occasionally in Band-e Amir National Park and Wakhan National Park. So far, these protected areas are poorly enforced against poaching and unregulated livestock grazing. In Afghanistan, <em>O. vignei</em> was placed on the country’s first Protected Species List in 2009, prohibiting all hunting and trading of this species within the country. The Government of Afghanistan supported technically by the Wildlife Conservation Society continues to search for other currently unidentified populations of Urial, and is also beginning to put into place protection and enforcement measures around existing strongholds to ensure that Urial will continue to survive in Afghanistan (WCS Afghanistan 2014, <a href=""www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). Conservation measures implemented: 1) Extensive surveys of Urial populations and distributions in potential habitats and monitoring of populations in protected areas; 2) Involvement of local traditional hunters and other community members in protection activities as community rangers; 3) In Wakhan awareness raising on national and local regulations amongst communities and armed forces in the area; 4) Preventive vaccination of livestock against diseases transmissible to Urial in Wakhan National Park and Bamyan Plateau Protected Area; and 5) Support local communities in preventing damage to crops (e.g., protective measures, adapted selection of crops). In the future ecotourism, Urial viewing and hunting tourism could also be explored as sources of revenue for local people and incentive to protect the species.<br/><br/>In India, the Ladakh Urial is as a threatened species by the Government of India under its Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and its subsequent amendments. Hemis National Park (Ladakh) contains the only Urial population currently found in a protected area in India. Raghavan and Bhatnagar (2006) suggest that Ladakh has limited arable land, pasture, food and water resources that are shared between humans, livestock and wild animals. Therefore, people living in close contact with the wild animals are the primary stakeholders in any conservation and management action adopted for these animals. They propose the following conservation measures: 1) Research and monitoring with regard to Urial population, their ecology and rangeland use by Urial and livestock; 2) strict enforcement of the hunting ban, by improving effectiveness of protection staff; 3) Community-based conservation action, including active involvement of local people in conservation of Urial and its habitat, education, reduction of people’s dependence on pasture resources. Further, the country’s national landscape level, participatory conservation strategy, the Project Snow Leopard, will focus on Urial conservation outside wildlife protected areas too. Further, two new Wildlife Sanctuaries, Suru Valley Wildlife Sanctuary and Zanskar High Altitude Wildlife Sanctuary, are being set up in the Kargil district of the newly designated Union Territory of Ladakh, which will enhance Urial conservation in the country.<br/><br/>In Iran, Urial is a protected species that can be hunted under licences issued by the Department of the Environment. Unfortunately, the exact numbers of Urials shot each year by hunters are not available and differ substantially from year to year due to contrasting policies of promoting trophy hunting or blanket bans on all hunting according to change of leadership and conservation vision at the Department of Environment. When authorized by the DoE leadership hunting under a special licence is permitted in a number of protected areas (e.g., Heidary Protected Area). Urial occurs in several protected areas in Iran (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a; Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016; Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, even so the government invests significantly at combating it, poaching prevails in most protected areas (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2016; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019) in spite of the hefty fines of around 1,785 Euro (i.e., 250,000,000 IRR; 1 Euro ~ 140,000 IRR 2020).<br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, Urial is listed in the Red Book and thus formally protected from any extractive use. The species is found in Ustyurt Strict Nature Reserve and in several reserves and provincial parks. In the area of the sacred site Beket-Ata Urial is traditionally protected from poaching and the animals are habituated to visitors. In the Aktau-Buzachin Reserve limited hunting based on a quota of annually 5 to 20 rams had been used as a source of funding for conservation activities (Fedosenko and Weinberg 1999). This quota seemed sustainable (Frisina 2002), but the program ended in the early 2000s and since then no legal hunting takes place in Kazakhstan. Discussions are ongoing, if the introduction of a legal hunting program, based on sound monitoring and conservatively set quotas, directly benefiting protected areas and local rural people might help to reduce poaching and to recover Urial numbers.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, Urial is a protected species, but permits for hunts in managed areas can be issued at provincial level. Several protected areas have mostly very small numbers of Urial and the level of effective protection is unclear. Managed game reserves have been effective in restoring and conserving of Urial including, e.g., Torghar (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2004, Arshad and Khan 2009) and Dureji (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2006) areas in Baluchistan (<em>O. v. cycloceros</em>), Kalabagh (Awan <em>et al</em>. 2006) in Punjab (<em>O. v. punjabensis</em>), and Bunji in Gilgit-Baltistan (<em>O. v. vignei</em>). Some of these areas not only prevent poaching but also prohibit or regulate livestock grazing, like Kalabagh Game Reserve (Awan <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Bunji Conservancy, the possibility of trophy hunting revenues play an incentive role to better protect the Ladakh urial, as it does for markhor. The main challenges are the vastness of an area difficult to control from outsiders, the large number of people and communities inhabiting the area and anticipated conflicts, and currently the lack of significant investment at protecting the species in anticipation of possible revenues from trophy hunting (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Urial is legally protected as species listed in the Red Book. A limited number of permits is annually issued for trophy hunting. Urials occur in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve but had been under pressure from poaching there and in the adjacent areas. Also, other protected areas have limited effect in terms of protection of Urial from poaching and impact of livestock. The establishment of game management areas managed by communities or local family businesses where trophy hunting locally benefits Urial conservation and community well-being has potential to be expanded (Michel 2014). Breeding enclosures, as the one already established in Khatlon Province, may have rather adverse impact if they distract attention from the conservation of free ranging populations, are not attractive for responsible hunters and bear risks of inbreeding, disease and hybridizing with European Mouflon if kept in the same area.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, the three subspecies (<em>O. v. arkal,</em> <em>bochariensis </em>and <em>cycloceros</em>) are all listed under Category II of the national Red Book and thus legally protected. In the 1990s, Turkmenistan issued a limited number of permits for Urial hunts in the Kopet Dagh Mountains at USD 14,900 per animal (Weinberg, Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1997). Urial occurs in the Kaplankyr, Kopet Dagh, Siunt-Khasardag, Badhgyz and Koytendag Strict Nature Reserves.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Urial is protected due to its Red Book status. A small number of permits for trophy hunting is nevertheless issued and currently Urial hunts are offered on the internet. Urial (<em>O. v. bochariensis</em>) occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone in the Kugitang Mountain Range. The creation of additional protected areas in the Babatag and Baysuntau has been proposed. Uzbekistan plans the establishment of a strict nature reserve in the southern Ustyurt, benefiting the subspecies <em>O. v. arkal</em>. Protected areas’ effectiveness in preventing poaching and at least controlling livestock grazing needs to be improved.<br/></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
57549321,899,Vulpes lagopus,Least Concern,,2014,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats, with a global population in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers, but in most areas population status is believed to be good and there is no reason to believe that the species currently qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the criteria.","Inhabits Arctic and alpine tundra on the continents of Eurasia, North America and the Canadian archipelago, Siberian islands, Greenland, inland Iceland and Svalbard, and Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands and coastal Iceland. <br/><br/>The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger but in most inland areas, the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. The species' main prey items include lemmings, both <em>Lemmus</em> spp. and <em>Dicrostonyx</em> spp. (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Fennoscandia, <em>Lemmus lemmus</em> was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds (Passeriformes, Galliformes and Caridriiformes, 34%) and reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (21%; Elmhagen <em>et al</em>. 2000). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse (<em>Lagopus</em> spp.) are common prey in addition to rodents and reindeer (Kaikusalo and Angerbjörn 1995). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013) with up to 20 cubs produced by a single female (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1998).<br/><br/>Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (<em>Uria aalge</em>, <em>U. lomvia</em>), seal carcasses and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of Arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally (Samelius and Lee 1998).&#160;Some populations switch between lemmings, migratory birds and marine resources depending on intra- and interannual variations in prey availability. The Arctic Fox depends also on remains of carrion left by larger predators, e.g. Polar Bear, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, and Wolverine <em>Gulo gulo</em>. It is itself a victim of predation, mainly from Red Fox, Wolverine, Golden Eagle, and humans.","Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox. With the decline of the fur hunting industry, the threat of over-exploitation is lowered for most Arctic Fox populations. They may also be subject to direct persecution (as on St. Paul Island). Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy. In areas connected to marine ecosystems, Arctic Foxes may also be affected by indirect threats, such as diseases and the effects of persistent organic pollutants (Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2008); indeed, an emerging threat in Fennoscandia is the impact of sarcoptic mange on populations (Mörner 1992).&#160;In some areas, gene swamping by farm-bred blue foxes (see Conservation) may threaten native populations (Norén&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).","The world population of Arctic Foxes is in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers. In most areas, however, population status is believed to be good. The species is common in the tundra areas of Russia, Canada, coastal Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Exceptions are Fennoscandia, islands in the Bering Sea (Mednyi Island, Russia; Pribilof Islands, Alaska, e.g., St Paul), where populations are at critically low levels and appear to be declining further. On some Aleutian Islands, Alaska, non-native Arctic Foxes are being eradicated in the course of bird conservation efforts (Walton <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Vagrant Arctic Foxes are common over the northern sea-ice where can move several thousands of kilometres following Polar Bears <em>Ursus maritimus&#160;</em>as scavengers (Tarroux <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Stable,"The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats. It breeds north of and above the tree line on the Arctic tundra in North America and Eurasia and on the alpine tundra in Fennoscandia, ranging from northern Greenland at 88°N to the southern tip of Hudson Bay, Canada, 53°N. The southern edge of the species' distribution range may have moved somewhat north during the 20th century resulting in a smaller total range (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1992). The species inhabits most Arctic islands and many islands in the Bering Sea. The Arctic Fox was also introduced to previously isolated islands in the Aleutian chain at the end of the 19th century by the fur industry (Bailey 1992), where they are now often being eliminated by bird conservation efforts (Walton <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Arctic Fox has also been observed on the sea ice up to the North Pole. They may occur up to 3,000 m asl in elevation.&#160;<br/><br/>During the last glaciation, the Arctic Fox had a distribution along the ice edge, and Arctic Fox remains have been found in a number of Pleistocene deposits over most of Europe and large parts of Siberia (Dalén <em>et al</em>. 2007).","The Arctic Fox remains the single most important terrestrial game species in the Arctic. Indigenous peoples have always utilized its exceptional fur, and with the advent of the fur industry, the Arctic Fox quickly became an important source of income. Today, leg-hold traps and shooting are the main hunting methods. Because of their large reproductive capacity, Arctic Foxes can maintain population levels under high hunting pressure. In some areas, up to 50% of the total population has been harvested on a sustainable basis (Nasimovic and Isakov 1985). However, this does not allow for hunting during population lows, as shown by the situation in Fennoscandia. The Arctic Fox has nevertheless survived high fur prices better than most other Arctic mammals. Hunting has declined considerably in the last decades, as a result of low fur prices and alternative sources of income. In the Yukon, for example, the total value of all fur production decreased from $1.3 million in 1988 to less than $300,000 after 2000.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The species is not included in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In most of its range, the Arctic Fox is not protected. However, the species and its dens have had total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in mainland Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the Arctic Fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE). It is therefore to be given full protection. On St. Paul Island the declining Arctic Fox population currently has no legal protection (Walton<em> et al</em>. 2013). In Norway (Svalbard), Greenland, Canada, Russia, and Alaska, trapping is limited to licensed trappers operating in a defined trapping season. The enforcement of these laws appears to be uniformly good. In Iceland, bounty hunting takes place over most of the country outside nature reserves.<br/><br/>For occurrence in protected areas, good information is available only for Sweden and Finland. For Iceland, Arctic Foxes could potentially appear in most protected areas. <br/><br/>An action plan has been developed for Arctic Foxes in Sweden (Elmhagen 2008) and status reports have been published for Norway (Ulvund <em>et al</em>. 2013) and Finland (Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Sweden, Norway and Finland, a conservation project led to significant increases in the population (Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>The Arctic Fox occurs widely in captivity on fur farms and has been bred for fur production for over 70 years. The present captive population originates from a number of wild populations and has been bred for characteristics different from those found in the wild, including large size. Escaped ""blue"" foxes may already be a problem in Fennoscandia (and to a lesser extent in Iceland) due to gene swamping (Norén <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;In Norway, foxes bred in captivity have successfully been released into the wild (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The following gaps still exist in knowledge of the Arctic Fox:<br/><br/>1) Little is known concerning the impact of diseases on fox populations, e.g. sarcoptic mange and <em>Echinococcus multilocularis</em>. Allied to this is our lack of knowledge of the epidemiology of Arctic rabies.<br/><br/>2) Considering the northward spread of the Red Fox in certain areas, studies are necessary to determine the effects of competition between Red Foxes and Arctic Foxes on various population parameters and Arctic Fox life-history patterns.<br/><br/>3) The non-recovery of the Fennoscandian population is a cause for concern, and requires specific attention, especially in terms of disease and genetics.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In the western part of the range, Corsacs occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall grass steppes. In Kaspyi Sea region the steppes and tarragon-cereal semi-deserts are favoured. It also occurs in fixed-sand habitats (Nogaiskaya Steppe). In the Volgo-Ural watershed the Corsac inhabits most usual habitats, but prefers semi-deserts. To the east of the Ural Mountains, the species inhabits steppes and in favourable years occurs even in forested steppes. In Mongolia and Kazakhstan typical habitats are low grass steppes and semi-deserts, often inhabiting low hills, but avoiding low mountains. In Middle-Asia it inhabits semi-deserts and ephemeral-deserts, avoiding drifting sands. One limiting factor is snow height in winter, and this species has been reported to avoid areas where the depth of snow exceeds 150 mm, preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed. <br/><br/>Corsacs occupy home ranges that vary depending on landscape conditions.&#160;In Mongolia, home ranges averaged 6.5 km<sup>2</sup> and ranged from 2.2 to 9.7 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;seasonally among a radio-collared population.&#160;Home ranges elsewhere have been reported to vary from as small as 1 km<sup>2</sup> to as large as 35-40 km<sup>2</sup> (based on anecdotal reports and observations).&#160;Home ranges typically include a mix of steppe, semi-desert, and desert habitats.<br/><br/>Corsacs are mainly nocturnal, but have been observed to be active during twilight and daytime hours.&#160;They typically spend daytime hours in a subterranean burrow or den, which presumably provides shelter from weather conditions (e.g, heat, aridity).&#160;Home ranges may have several actively used burrows, which may also provide temporary refuges from predators or competitors.&#160;About 64% of burrows used in Mongolia were those of Siberian marmots (<em>Marmota sibirica</em>).&#160;Marmots live in colonies that may include &gt;90 burrows spread over several hectares.&#160;Marmots have declined substantially due to overharvesting.&#160;The decline of marmots may be linked to population declines of Corsacs in some areas.","<p>The primary threat to Corsac Foxes is over-harvesting.&#160;Throughout most of their range, Corsacs are hunted intensively for their pelts.&#160;Hunting has been a traditional (and commercial) activity in most range countries and harvest numbers have historically been large.&#160;For example, up to 50,000 foxes were harvested in Russia in some years during the 20th century (one record even indicated 135,700 skins were tanned in 1923/24) (Heptner and Naumov 1998).&#160;Similarly, in Mongolia, an estimated 1.1 million furs were sold to the Soviet Union from 1932 to 1972 with a peak trade of 62,926 in 1947 (Wingard and Zahler 2006).&#160;Over-harvesting resulted in hunting bans in both countries at times to allow populations to recover following periods of intensive hunting.&#160;Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, societal change has resulted in few regulations on hunting in several range countries, which has been exacerbated by growing commercial markets for fur.&#160;As a result, over-harvesting and illegal trade in international markets has been a growing concern for the species.</p>  Other threats include overgrazing by livestock and landscape development (e.g., roads, houses, mining), which may reduce habitat quality for the species.&#160;The decline of marmots may also impact the species in some areas, as Corsacs often use marmot burrows as daytime resting locations.&#160;Further studies on the impacts of land use/development and interactions with other species are needed.","The Corsac Fox is generally a widespread and common species.&#160; However, there are no range-wide estimates of population size and few details are known about the characteristics of regional populations.&#160;Most information on population trends is based on harvest numbers and observations.&#160;Some accounts suggest that Corsac populations fluctuate greatly over short periods of time, often in response to climatic events (e.g., cold winters with high snowfall). One report indicated that numbers can drop tenfold within the space of a single year. By comparison, in favourable years, numbers can increase by the same margin, but more within a three- to four-year period. Population changes have also driven by intensive harvesting for furs.&#160;Harvest levels have varied by country and probably reflect population trends.",Unknown,"Corsac distribution extends across much of Eurasia. One part covers the Middle Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, as well as steppe and forest-steppe areas of Russia, including the southern region of Western Siberia. In Europe its range reaches the Samara Region, Tatarstan to the North and northern Caucasia to the South. The second, much smaller area lies in southern Transbaikalia representing the northern periphery of the Mongolian and Manchurian section of the species' distribution. Outside Russia the species' range includes the steppe part of north-eastern China, including Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and the region between Argun and Big Khingan, most of Mongolia except for its forested and mountain regions, Dgungaria, Kashgaria, Afghanistan (probably only northern) and north-eastern Iran. The southern limit of distribution is unknown, but it probably reaches to the mountain ridges separating the Tibetan Highlands from the north. Thus, the two ranges (western and eastern) are connected by a relatively narrow neck in the Dgungar Gate and Zaisan Basin region. In recent years, a westward area expansion has been recorded, particularly into the Voronezh region following active recovery of Baibak (<em>Marmota bobak</em>) populations. Occasionally, the species is recorded from the Ukrainian steppe (as far as Pavlodar to the West), eastern Transcaucasia (Azerbaijan) and, probably, western Kyrgyzstan.<br/><br/>In Russia the Corsac is rare in most regions, but common in western Siberia and Transbaikalia. It sometimes occurs in northern parts of western Siberia's forested steppes, but in low numbers. The species is common everywhere between the Volga and Ural rivers.

64313015,61513537,Pseudois nayaur,Least Concern,,2014,2014-06-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because any decline is probably much less than the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.","Blue Sheep occupy a variety of habitats across the region. Blue Sheep inhabit open grassy slopes in high mountains from 2,500-5,500 m asl. They are usually found near cliffs and similar escape cover, but generally avoid entering forested areas (Schaller 1977; the Helan Shan is a partial exception). This species is often able to maintain locally high densities in habitats otherwise inhospitable to other wild species. Often, these areas are close to (although generally at higher elevations, or in less productive habitats than) domestic livestock. They are very tolerant of environmental extremes from desert mountains in searing heat to windy and cold slopes (Schaller 1998). They feed on grass and alpine herbs and lichens and live in small to rather large herds, alternately resting and feeding on steep grassy slopes of alpine meadows. Sentinels watch out for snow leopards, their primary predator. Breeding season is during December-January, followed by a 160 day gestation. Single lambs (rarely twins) are born in early summer (mid-June in most of the Tibetan Plateau); weaning occurs in six months and young reach maturity 1.5 years.<br/><br/>Blue Sheep are active throughout the day, feeding on lichens, herbaceous plants, and mosses. Females gestate for 160 days and give birth to one offspring per pregnancy.  The animals are sexually mature at 1.5 years, though males are not fully sexually active until age 7. They can live 12-15 years, although animals of &gt; 10 are rarely encountered.  Blue Sheep generally live in large groups. Males sometimes form all male herds, and sometimes mix with family aggregations. Small groups (e.g.,  300 individuals have been observed.","Competition with livestock has been suggested and probably occurs (Shrestha <em>et al</em>. 2005), but in general, habitat loss due to livestock threat is minor, and <em>P. nayaur</em> can sustain a reasonably large population under current and likely future scenarios with regard to the livestock industry. This is because reasonably large populations of the species can be supported entirely within high elevation, steep, or excessively rough/rocky terrain that is used sparingly if at all by domestic livestock. Livestock does exist near <em>P. nayaur</em> subpopulations, and in specific situations there may be conflicts. However, in general, it appears that even relatively intensive livestock grazing does not prohibit healthy populations of <em>P. nayaur</em>. This is in marked contrast to livestock’s effect on some other wild species.<br/><br/>Because access to <em>Pseudois nayaur</em> habitat is usually difficult and individual body-size is relatively small, market-based poaching for meat appears to be rare, at least in the northern portions of the Tibetan plateau. Locally-based, subsistence poaching has occurred frequently in recent years, and no doubt continues. However, China has recently begun implementing a new policy of confiscating all guns from nomadic pastoralists, and observations during 1998-2002 in Gansu and Qinghai provinces corroborate this (R. Harris pers. obs.). Thus, local herders now have little technology with which to poach <em>P. nayaur</em> for meat. International (“trophy”) hunting for <em>P. nayaur</em> occurs, but only in four to five designated areas in China and Nepal (and possibly in Pakistan), and in numbers too small to have substantial population impacts. It seems most likely, therefore, that human use of <em>P. nayaur</em> has been decreasing in recent years. International hunting (including for Blue Sheep) in China was suspended in 2006, and as of summer 2014 had not yet been re-established.<br/><br/>An outbreak of sarcoptic mange was reported among <em>P. nayaur</em> in extreme northern Pakistan, and has markedly reduced abundance locally. This may yet be a cause for concern range-wide, but similar reports from elsewhere within the species’ range have not surfaced (Woodford 2003, 2006).<br/><br/>In Bhutan, the species is not in immediate danger and numbers seem to be increasing due to the expansion of grazing areas for domestic yaks. However, heavy grazing by both species is damaging the fragile, high alpine vegetation, so Blue Sheep population trends may be reversed in the near future. <br/><br/>In India the major threat is localized over-hunting, including that by the army in remote outposts. Within Nepal, although in some areas religious beliefs protect Blue Sheep from poaching, excessive competition from livestock grazing may cause habitat degradation in much of its natural range. <br/><br/>In Pakistan, limited range and low numbers make Blue Sheep vulnerable to poaching and habitat loss. When access to the Shimshal valley is opened by construction of a jeep road, the species will most probably come under increased hunting pressure.","Range-wide population estimates are unavailable. Although not difficult to “count” once encountered, <em>P. nayaur</em> lives almost entirely in steep, mountainous terrain; it is also a relatively small-sized artiodactyl, with coloration that can make it very difficult to see unless observation conditions are excellent. It is probably absent from broad areas devoid of steep topography (e.g., basins). However, this does not necessarily mean populations are fragmented, because it appears to be present in virtually all appropriate mountainous terrain from the Qilian Mountains in the north to the Himalaya in the south.<br/><br/>In western China, <em>P. nayaur</em> was said to be “relatively abundant” (Shackleton 1997, Wang 1998), with various (questionable) local density estimates, and a total population greater than 10,000. The bulk of these 10,000 were an extrapolation for the Arjin Shan Nature Reserve, which is probably an overestimate. However, numerous areas within the current range were not included in this estimate, so the amount of 10,000 within the western portion of the Chinese range is not necessarily out of the question (Schaller 1998 guessed that at least 10,000 inhabited the Chang Tang Nature Reserve in western Tibet). Schaller (1998) cited an estimate by Pu (1993) of 34,500-49,600 in “western Tibet”, which includes but is larger than the Chang Tang Nature Reserve.<br/><br/>Further east within the Tibetan plateau, Wang (1998) cited a Chinese extrapolation of over 1,200,000 in Qinghai province (of which 267,000 were in “eastern” Qinghai), which is probably a considerable overestimate. Schaller (1998), in discussing the estimate by Pu (1993, see above), noted that it is likely that greater than 20-30% of the entire Chinese population lives east of “western Tibet”. If there are 30,000 – 50,000 in “western Tibet”, there may thus be roughly from 43,000 – 62,500 (using the derivation from Pu 1993), to 200,000 – 400,000 (using extrapolations from Wang 1998) within the entire Chinese portion of the Tibetan Plateau. <br/><br/>In the Helan Shan, Ren <em>et al</em>. (1999) and Lü <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated roughly 5,000 to 9,000 Blue Sheep, but their extrapolations were based on non-randomly placed transects. Liu <em>et al</em>. (2005) have continued to monitor this population, which, regardless of methodological problems in estimating its size, is clearly dense and in no danger.<br/><br/>Most extrapolations of population size in China are based on insufficient justification, and should be viewed with caution. However, in marked contrast to other species, field investigations of subjective and anecdotal reports of <em>P. nayaur</em> invariably confirm the presence and general abundance of this species. Thus, although specific figures in Chinese literature may be inaccurate, all evidence suggests that <em>P. nayaur</em> is widespread and relatively abundant within appropriate habitats within Chinese portions of the Tibetan plateau. <br/><br/>Within India, Shackleton (1997) cites an estimate produced by Fox <em>et al</em>. (1991) of “a minimum of 11,000” within Ladakh. In Nepal, Shackleton (1997) reports a “conservative estimate of 10,000 animals”, although Schaller (1998) included a table suggesting 1,947-2,561 in areas counted within Nepal. In Pakistan, Shackleton writes that, “according to written reports [Wegge 1988, Rasool 1990], the species is not as rare as previously thought…the most recent estimates indicated between 2,000 and 2,500 animals in 1992.” No estimate is available for Bhutan.<br/><br/>Taken together, these estimates suggest total population sizes of from roughly 47,000 (almost certainly a very conservative estimate) to 414,000 (probably an overestimate).",Unknown,"This species is found in Bhutan, China (Gansu, Ningxia-Inner Mongolia border, Qinghai, Sichuan, Tibet, southeastern Xinjiang, and northern Yunnan), northern India, northern Myanmar (Rabinowitz and&#160;Tun Khaing&#160;1998), Nepal, and northern Pakistan. Some sources have stated the species exists in Tajikistan (Grubb 2005), but recent evidence for this is lacking.<br/><br/>This taxon remains fairly abundant in most of its principle range among the ranges of the Tibetan Plateau in China (Schaller 1998, Harris 2007). In China, its distribution runs from western Tibet, southwestern Xinjiang (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1987) where there are small populations in the mountains bordering the western edge of Aru Co, extending eastwards with in scattered populations throughout the autonomous region. It also occurs in southern Xinjiang, along the Kunlun Mountains and in the Arjin Mountains. It is present in most mountain ranges of western and southern Qinghai into eastern Sichuan and northwestern Yunnan, as well as in the Qilian and associated ranges of Gansu. The eastern extent of its current distribution appears to be in the Helan Shan which form the western border of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (with Inner Mongolia). <br/><br/>It is found throughout northern Bhutan above 4,000 to 4,500 m asl. Blue Sheep are fairly continuously distributed in the northern Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan regions of India, although the extent of its eastern distribution along the northern border of Arunachal Pradesh is still unknown. They are relatively common in many areas of eastern Ladakh (Jammu and Kashmir), and in parts of Spiti and the upper Parbati valley in northern Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, S. Pandey pers. comm.). Blue Sheep are known to occur in the Govind Pashu Vihar Wildlife Sanctuary and Nanda Devi National Park, and near Badrinath (Uttar Pradesh), on the slopes of the Khangchendzonga massif (Sikkim), and in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. Very recently, Blue Sheep presence has been confirmed in the northwestern corner of Arunachal Pradesh near its border with Bhutan and China. In Nepal, it is fairly continuously distributed to the north of the Greater Himalaya from the border with India and Tibet in the extreme northwest, eastwards through Dolpo and Mustang to Gorkha district in north-central Nepal. It then re-occurs in Nepal in at least two isolated areas: in Lamobogar, and on the southwestern slopes of Kanchenjunga near the border with Sikkim (India) (Schaller 1977, Wegge 1991). These two are probably connected with more extensive populations across the border in Tibet. <br/><br/>Its main distribution range in Pakistan includes the upper Gujerab valley, the upper Shimshal valley, and the area eastward from Shimshal pass (District Gilgit), including part of Khunjerab National Park (Schaller 1976; Roberts 1977; Rasool 1986; Wegge 1988, 1989; G. Tallone&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1993). Outside these areas there is a single, recent observation of one animal from Khunjerab pass (R. Hess pers. obs. 1985). Earlier, Roberts (1977) mentioned its occurrence (with proof) around Shigar and the Baltoro glacier (District Baltistan), however, we have no actual information from this area. Roberts’ (1977) source for its occurrence in the Passu valley was a quote from Lydekker (1907) who mentioned “Hunza valley, near Passu”, but possibly meaning the Shimshal valley. The presence of the species in the Passu valley is not confirmed (D. Mallon pers. obs.&#160;<em>in litt</em>.).<br/><br/>Grubb (2005) indicates that Blue Sheep can be found in Tajikistan, but documentation for this is not provided, and recent surveys of the Pamir area have failed to mention find evidence of occurrence in Tajikistan (Magomedov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Schaller 2005), or neighboring regions of Taxkorgan County in Xinjiang, China (Schaller 2005) or Afghanistan (Schaller 2003). Maps of the species' distribution can be found in Shackleton (1997) and Schaller (1998).","This species is hunted for food. However, because access to&#160;<em>P. nayaur</em>&#160;habitat is usually difficult and individual body-size is relatively small,&#160;market-based poaching for meat appears to be rare, at least in the northern portions of the Tibetan plateau. Locally-based, subsistence poaching has occurred frequently in recent years, and no doubt continues.",Terrestrial,"In China, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em> are present within a number of large protected areas the Chang Tang Nature Reserve (Schaller and Gu 1994), Medoq, Qomolangma and Zayu Reserves (Tibet); the Arjin Mountain Reserve (Achuff and Petocz 1988, Butler <em>et al</em>. 1986, Gu 1990) and Taxkorgan Reserve (Schaller 1977; Xinjiang); Kekexili and Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserves in Qinghai; and Yanchiwan and Qilian Nature Reserves (western Gansu). Some of these protected areas truly limit human disturbance, some have been demarcated where human disturbance was already quite low (generally because inhospitable climate makes production for human purposes marginal at best); other protected area exist on paper only. Of note, however, is that, at least in China, <em>P. nayaur</em> appears able to persist at reasonable densities in the absence of protected areas. <em>P. nayaur</em> is categorized as a Class II protected species under China’s National Wildlife Law of 1988. Hunting of <em>P. nayaur</em> is legal only via permit obtained by provincial wildlife offices; in practice, such permits are provided only for foreign trophy hunters. Thus, hunting of <em>P. nayaur</em> is essentially illegal in China.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, Blue Sheep are known to occur in Jigme Dorji National Park. Conservation measures proposed by Wollenhaupt&#160;(1989) included, using input from local inhabitants, establishing integrated alpine forest and grassland reserves in high elevation areas where demand for domestic yak grazing is considerable and deforestation and degradation of alpine areas occur (Wollenhaupt 1989).<br/><br/>In India, Blue Sheep occur in several national parks and many other protected areas in northern India (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983; Green 1987; Pandey in prep.; Singh <em>et al</em>. 1990) including: Jammu and Kashmir - Hemis National Park and Sabu Chukor Wildlife Reserve; Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan and Pin Valley National Parks and Chital, Daranghati, Kais, Kanawar, Lippa Asrang, Rakshum, Rupi Bhaba, Sangla Valley (includes previous Rakcha-Chitkul WS), Sechu Tuan Nala, and Tirthan (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttar Pradesh - Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks, and Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park; and their unlikely presence in Namdapha National Park of northeastern Arunachal Pradesh needs to be checked. Conservation measures proposed for India: 1) Establish the proposed Changtang, Gya-Miru, Karakoram, and Lung Nag Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir), and the extensions to the Great Himalayan National Park and the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh). 2) Determine if Blue Sheep occur along the northern border of Arunachal Pradesh. 3) Make the control of illegal hunting of this species the primary management priority to maintain viable populations under current land use regimes. 4) Monitor changes in livestock grazing practices that could affect competition with Blue Sheep.<br/><br/>In Nepal, Blue Sheep are found in Shey-Phoksundo National Park and in the Annapurna Conservation Area. It is the main big game species in the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) Maintain the current, closely controlled legal hunting program, and 2) consider a regulated program of sustainable, low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers in some areas. At the same time, 3) steps should be taken to halt or reverse the habitat destruction caused by livestock grazing in the Blue Sheep’s natural habitat.<br/><br/>Khunjerab National Park contains a large portion of Pakistan’s total population of Blue Sheep. It occurs in no other protected area. Conservation measures proposed for Pakistan: 1) Extend the boundaries of Khunjerab&#160;National Park&#160;eastwards. 2) Address problems faced by local people whose livelihoods would be affected by this extension. The management plan originally proposed for Khunjerab&#160;National Park&#160;did not do this, but this is necessary before its conservation recommendations can be implemented. The measures taken in the Bar valley project initiated by WWF-Pakistan and similar projects could serve as useful models. 3) Determine what detrimental influences the new road to Shimshal will have in the Park’s modified management plan.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion C1.","The Brown Hyaena is found in dry areas, generally with annual rainfall less than 100 mm, particularly along the coast, semi-desert, open scrub and open woodland savanna with a maximum rainfall up to about 700 mm. It shows an ability to survive close to urban areas. It is predominantly nocturnal in its activity (Hulsman <em>et al</em>. 2010). The&#160;Brown Hyaena&#160;is independent of drinking water, but needs some type of cover in which to lie up during the day. For this it favours rocky, mountainous areas with bush cover in the bushveld areas of South Africa (Skinner 1976). It is primarily a scavenger of a wide range of vertebrate remains, which is supplemented by wild fruit and other plant material, insects, birds’ eggs, and the occasional small animal which is killed; their impact on domestic livestock is usually very small (Mills 1998, 1990; Maude and Mills 2005; Schiess-Meier <em>et al</em>. 2007). On Namibian farmlands, Brown Hyaenas often scavenge from leopard kills (Stein <em>et al.</em> 2013). Along the Namib Desert Coast, Brown Hyaenas are successful hunters of Cape Fur Seal pups (e.g. Wiesel 2006, Wiesel 2010). Populations of Brown Hyaenas in non-protected areas comprise a significant proportion of the global population, suggesting that such areas are likely to be important for their sustained conservation (Kent and Hill 2013, Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2013). Working in areas occupied by pastoralist herders, Maude and Mills              (2005) found, that, although Brown Hyaenas feed on carcasses of livestock, there was no evidence to suggest that Brown Hyaenas hunted livestock, or any other significantly sized mammals. Thus the persecution of them because of perceived livestock predation is unjustified. The dietary benefit derived by the Brown Hyaenas from the presence of subsistence pastoralists and their livestock carcasses, may be the primary reason that Brown Hyaena populations are viable in cattle areas (Maude and Mills&#160;2005).","Outside protected areas, the Brown Hyaena may come into conflict with humans, and they are often shot, poisoned, trapped and hunted with dogs in predator eradication or control programmes, or inadvertently killed in non-selective control programs (Mills 1998). Brown Hyaena body parts are used in traditional medicine and Brown Hyaenas are also often unintentional victims of lethal problem animal  control through poisons and poaching through snares (I. Wiesel, C. Edwards, L. Boast and R. Yarnell pers. comms. 2014). Lethal control remains the most predominant form of conflict resolution. The Brown Hyaena is regarded as a threat to livestock in some areas, and over 72% of livestock owners in Namibia believe that the Brown Hyaena is responsible for losses (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013), despite the finding that Brown Hyaenas very seldom prey on livestock (Maude and Mills&#160;2005). In South Africa's North West Province 40% of livestock owners regard the Brown Hyaena as a problem animal (Thorn 2008), but in the North West Province, only 6% of surveyed farmers admit to having killed&#160;Brown Hyaenas&#160;on their property (St John <em>et al</em>. 2011). Persecution in small stock areas in Namibia has lead to the local extinction of Brown Hyaenas in the southeastern parts of that country, where increasing conflict may lead to further population decline.","The total population size on the continent has been estimated as at a minimum of 5,000 to 8,000 individuals, with Botswana having the largest population (an estimated 3,900 animals; ,Hofer and Mills 1998b). However, numbers for Botswana may be higher, as one density study for the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Makgadikgadi Pans estimates the park's Brown Hyaena population at 2,253 animals (G. Maude pers. comm.). Winterbach and Winterbach (2014) estimate Botswana's total population in 2014 between 2,799 and 5,271 animals. &#160;A recent national population estimate for Namibia puts the number of Brown Hyaenas at 566-2,440 animals (Stein <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thorn (2008, unpublished PhD thesis) estimates South Africa's population at 1,007 (31-2,316) animals. No recent population size estimates are available for Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Lesotho or Swaziland. Mean density of Brown Hyaenas on farmlands in Botswana was 2.3 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> based on camera trap data, and 2.88 per 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;based on spoor surveys (Kent and Hill 2013). Thorn <em>et al</em>.

Almost 90% of the Brown Hyena population in Botswana occurs in the Southern Conservation Zone (Winterbach <em>et al</em>. 2014). The range of the Brown Hyaena has shrunk significantly since the end of the 18th century when it was last recorded from Table Bay in the extreme southwest of the continent (Hofer and Mills 1998a, Mills 1990). They remain widespread in southern Africa, and in recent years in South Africa have been recorded from the extreme south in the Western Cape (Gansbaai and Bredasdorp), possibly vagrants from a small population in the Little Karoo (Yarnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thorn <em>et al</em>. (2011a) found that Brown Hyena distribution in northern South Africa was larger than in previous estimates. However, in farm land in this same area, Brown Hyaena occupancy was estimated at 0.748 (±SE 0.1), and estimated overall density in agricultural land (0.15/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, ±SE 0.08), which was an order of magnitude lower than in protected areas (Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011b). Boast and Houser (2012) also found that Brown Hyena distribution in Ghanzi, Botswana was larger than previously believed. Several re-introductions have taken place in South Africa's Eastern Cape (e.g., Shamwari Game Reserve; Slater and Muller 2014), and sightings have since been recorded there (e.g., Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). Other range expansions have also been recorded from South Africa (Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Recent studies from Zimbabwe show a range expansion into the north/northwest region of the country (E. van der Meer pers. comm. 2014) and into the east (R. Groom pers. comm. 2014). They seem to be absent from southeast Namibia (I. Wiesel pers. comm. 2014) and the Zambezi region (former Caprivi Strip; L. Hanssen pers. comm. 2014).

A recent study from Botswana suggested that a significant proportion of the global Brown Hyaena population is found in non-protected areas, and that these animals can also tolerate land-use changes under some circumstances (Kent and Hill 2013). Boast and Houser (2012) found that Brown Hyaenas occurred evenly on game and cattle farms in Botswana, and in Namibia 54.5% of farm owners reported Brown Hyaena presence (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased efforts to educate farmers and pastoralists about the fact that Brown Hyenas pose very little risk to livestock is likely to enhance conservation of these animals.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

These vary in severity between regions, and in some areas considerably exceed the threshold for Vulnerable. In the last three generations (taken to be 24–30 years), declines in mainland South-east Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia), Bangladesh, and possibly Borneo and Sumatra have exceeded 50%, probably by a substantial margin. Despite this Sambar remains common in some localized logged, unprotected areas on Borneo, such as the Hose Mountains of Sarawak (where a national park is proposed but not yet enforced), but only where human access is difficult. The overall decline rate in India has been less, given the presence of large populations in a fair number of well-secured protected areas which have probably remained stable, but a decline rate averaging 30% is reasonable in India outside these areas (i.e. in the less effective protected areas and outside the protected areas network), and in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The situation in China is unclear as in some areas, for example Hainan, population recovery may be occurring, whilst major declines in other regions may have taken place prior to the 24–30 year assessment window; the population on Taiwan appears to be relatively stable. Although declines seem to be reversing very locally in a few sites, these numbers are a very small proportion of the whole population. There is no indication that declines will, at the species level, slow until populations are extinguished outside well-secured protected areas, which currently comprise only a small proportion of protected areas holding the species. Current trends of wild meat and antler marketing in South-east Asia and China suggest declines have probably sped up in some areas especially Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Since the 2008 assessment trends in wildlife exploitation and natural habitat conversion in mainland Southeast Asia, have if anything increased, thus although the relative size of the Southeast Asian population subcomponent has probably decreased compared with that in South Asia, the rate of decline has probably increased. The global population trend is still considered to be a decline somewhere between 30 and 50 % over three generations, for the past, present and future.&#160;The fact that Sambar is at least locally common in a number of high profile protected areas, such as Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and Cat Tien National Park, Viet Nam, and is commonly kept captive and proliferates in menageries in the region, was probably a significant factor in the failure to recognize the plight of the species prior to the 2008 reassessment. These same factors no doubt still to some degree cloud the issue.","No large Indian ungulate has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions than has Sambar (Schaller 1967). Within India, Sambar occurs in the thorn and arid forests of Gujarat and Rajasthan, in the moist and dry deciduous forests throughout peninsular India, in the pine and oak forests at the Himalayan foothills, and in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of northeastern India and the Western Ghats (Sankar and Acharya 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Outside India it extends into temperate-latitude and alpine-zone woodlands of Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). This habitat flexibility is permitted by its broad diet: Sambar has been documented to eat 130–180 species of plants in India alone (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh and Sankar 1991, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), with food requirements less specialised than those of other deer (Schaller 1967). Sambar grazes or browses depending upon the forage available at that time (Schaller 1967, Richardson 1972, Martin 1977, Bentley 1978, Dinerstein 1979, Kelton and Skipworth 1987, Ngampongsai 1987, Sankar 1994, Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Across the very wide altitudinal range occupied in Taiwan, the diet varies reflecting major changes in plant communities (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). Sambar was found to live in much higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests of Nagarahole National Park (Karanth and Sunquist 1992) and there are no doubt also patterns of habitat selection across the rest of its range. Although the highest densities of Sambar so far recorded were in the semi-arid forests of Ranthambore (Kumar 2000), across most of its Indian range Sambar seems to thrive best in well-watered, moist deciduous hilly terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The Sambar occurs up to at least 3,825 m on Siouguluan Mountain, the highest peak of the Central Mountains in Taiwan; elsewhere on the island it ranges down to 150 m asl, mostly living at 2,000–3,500 m (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). It occurs up to 3,000 m on Gunung Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Myanmar, recent camera-trap photographs spanned the range of 0–2,150 m asl (Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is largely restricted to hilly terrain in the Terai Arc Landscape (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), although how much this reflects real habitat selection and how much it is an artificial pattern produced by human effects (habitat conversion and hunting) is unclear. More widely in India, there does seem to be a marked preference for undulating terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar usage was greater of the higher than the lower altitude area. However, it makes wide use of plains areas elsewhere, where these have not been destroyed, e.g. the Hukaung Valley in Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008).In Borneo, while Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered Sambar “most common in secondary forests of gently-sloping terrain” they also knew of occurrence in “tall dipterocarp forests on steep terrain and in swamp forests”. In Thung Yai, Thailand, Sambar signs were twice as abundant in lowland forest as in montane forest, although this difference was not statistically significant (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Across seven sites in Thailand, places where sambar was detected had shallower slopes, more open habitat, were closer to streams, closer to roads and villages, and had lower rainfall (Lynam <em>et al. </em>2012).In Southeast Asian regions of dense evergreen closed-canopy forest, Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978, Heydon 1994, Stuebing 1995, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Sabah, Sambar was camera-trapped in both mature and young forest stands (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). All the remaining Lao populations are centred around areas with extensive open, or at least broken, habitat amid forest (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), and the general paucity of records from the interiors of large blocks of closed-canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which generally support the least depleted large mammal populations, probably reflects natural patterns of habitat occupation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Similarly, in extensive tracts of deciduous dipterocarp forest the species occurs primarily around patches of denser habitats, and this seems to be a natural rather than hunting-led pattern (Timmins and Ou 2001). In this sense, in Indochina Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em> is much more tolerant and versatile than is Sambar. In southern and central India where much of the forest is deciduous, Sambar is a true forest ungulate and conspicuously avoids disturbed and open forests, and is highly sensitive to any sort of forest resource extractive activities (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar was primarily in areas of high tree and herb density with low shrub density. O'Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) found no statistically significant difference in Sambar abundance between areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and those deep in the interior of the park. Caution is needed in inferring that there is truly no association of Sumatran Sambar with forest edges (which would be astonishing by comparison with its habitat use elsewhere) because the study does not specify whether this ‘non-significant’ result might simply reflect methodological factors rather than a genuine lack of biological effect (see, e.g., Johnson 1999). Despite the population rises that occur in post-logging forest, there is no evidence that Sambar can survive landscape-level conversion to exotic plantations or other non-forest land-uses, although many live in coconut plantations (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and it is relatively common in immature <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations within the matrix of plantation and natural forest of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;Camera trapping in oil palm plantations adjacent to Danum Valley in Sabah suggest that the species does not utilize plantations (Yue and J. Brodie unpublished data).A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Sambar only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007). In forest protected areas of Thailand such as Khao Yai National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sambar populations are often concentrated around anthropogenic grass and scrub (e.g. sites of former villages) rather than in the forest itself (Trisurat <em>et al</em>. 1996; Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and this also seems to be true on remote parts of the Bolaven Plateau of south Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Annamite mountains of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Sambar seems often to be associated with degraded valley bottom areas, largely the result of long human influence: although the effects of a permanent water source and differences in terrain in determining distribution are difficult to disentangle (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar regularly visits salt licks (e.g. Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007), perhaps especially when growing new antlers. This predictability exposes it to high levels of hunting, where this is not effectively controlled. It seems that within an area, not all sort of licks are visited. At the Seima Biodivesity Conservation Area, Cambodia, Sambar photographs were initially very few at mineral lick camera-traps. But in 2007, cameras placed on trails and at some permanent water sources (especially in semi-evergreen forest) recorded Sambar much more often. Checking tracks at more than 40 licks indicated that some were used by Sambar and Red Muntjac, but not Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> or Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, while the big ones with many cattle and elephant prints had few Sambar prints (E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar was considered to be mostly nocturnal by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004), to show ‘no pattern’ (meaning unclear; perhaps intended to imply no significant variation through the 24-hour cycle, although this is itself a pattern) by O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003), and to be cathemeral by van Schaik and Griffiths (1996). In fact, its activity pattern may vary across sites, but in general it is mostly crepuscular, with significant nocturnal activity as well (Schaller 1967; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is essentially non-social, stable groups being at most family associations (Schaller 1967; Karanth and Sunquist 1992). However, it is often in groups, presumably temporary, of 12–30 in dry deciduous and semi-arid forests of India (e.g. Bandipur, Pench, Melghat and Ranthambore) (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and the same is true around the secondary grasslands within Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). During peak summer, such associations of up to 80–100 near large waterbodies are not uncommon in Pench in central India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A detailed review of information on grouping in Sambar is in Sankar and Acharya (2004). Results from many areas show a strong bias in sex ratio to females, perhaps reflecting selective predation; alternatively, stags may be more vulnerable to stress (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Breeding is rather seasonal in most areas where studied, for example Schaller (1967) reported that in Kanha the rut spreads over a period of at least seven months with a peak in November–December. Stags during the rut sometimes can cover large distances, up to 10–20 km in one night. Further information for India is reviewed in Sankar and Acharya (2004). The bucks of Formosan Sambar have a seasonal antler cycle, and the mating season is from June to January with a peak in September–October. Males wallow and mark with scent glands in this season. Fawns are born (usually singly) from March to August, with a peak in May and June (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Predation appears to be the major cause of Sambar mortality. In Bandipur, Sambar is one of the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (31%), Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> (8%) and Dhole <em>C. alpinus</em> (13%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur Sambar remains were found in about 22.3% of Tiger faeces, 6.1% of Leopard faeces and 7.3% of Dhole faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, proportion of Sambar in Tiger’s diet was about 25–29%, derived from faeces and kill data respectively (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Sambar together with Gaur contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). Sambar occurred in 50% of Tiger scats in Pench-Maharashtra (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Sambar together with Gaur are selectively predated by Tiger.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region and in much of the rest of Sambar’s range. Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow <em>Capricornis crispus</em> and Reeves’s Muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).<br/><br/>There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats <em>Panthera</em>) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs <em>Munitacus</em> spp.<br/><br/>Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (<span lang=""EN-US"">A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002,&#160;J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km<sup>2</sup> per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing,&#160;as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press).&#160;Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.<br/><br/>On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and muntjacs <em>Muntiacus</em>) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001).&#160;Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).<br/><br/><p> </p>  <p>In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of <em>Acacia mangium</em> although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments.&#160;The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p>Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). &#160;If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound.</p><p><br/></p> Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brodie <em>et al. </em>in press b, c). Degradation <em>per se</em> is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2014; Lynam<em> et al.</em> 2012, Brodie<em> et al.</em> in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species. &#160;In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.<br/> <br/> Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa <em>Rusa timorensis</em> has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital <em>Axis axis</em> (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.</span>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Almost everywhere outside Taiwan and <span lang=""EN-GB"">well-managed protected areas<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">in India, the Sambar is in rapid decline, which has lead to very low numbers and many local-level extinctions over a wide area. The occasional healthy populations reflecting special circumstances. Few surveys specifically target Sambar, but a reasonable picture of its current status is emerging through surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris </em>and through general wildlife surveys. Tiger-oriented camera-trapping predictably yields photographs of Sambar when it is present, and most Tiger surveys afford priority to elucidating Sambar status as a key prey, and therefore population determinant, of Tiger. Understanding Sambar status through surveys of Tigers or, sometimes, of Leopard <em>P. pardus </em>(e.g. Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2007) needs care, because such surveys have generally selected the best remaining areas for very large mammals within the country or region in question, so as to maximize chances of picking up Tigers. They therefore cannot be seen as indicative of Sambar status in the wider landscape. Most importantly, in the several cases (identified below) where such surveys have found few Sambar, these indicate cause for alarm, because there is little reason to believe that there ought to be larger populations in many other areas in the country or region in question, even though large parts of it may remain unsurveyed. Occasional herds can survive in unexpected places through atypical site-specific circumstances in some countries (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Populations outside the native range are not treated here, as they are irrelevant to assigning the Red List Category and Criteria.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Sri Lanka, numbers have probably declined substantially through poaching which increased during the civil war. Poaching occurred widely across the country, including within protected areas, particularly where there are concentrations of resettled refugees (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/> <br/> In India, although the Sambar occurs widely and in many habitat types, and large populations occur in well-secured protected areas, nowhere is it now regionally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004); although see below. It has been recorded in 208 protected areas (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India, cited in Sankar and Acharya 2004); its distribution outside protected areas is now generally highly scattered. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Sambar status is best in the three southern Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Most protected areas (tiger reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries) in these states appear to have stable or even increasing Sambar local populations and they are easily one of the most common ungulates encountered in protected areas (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Protected areas in Karnataka in particular have high densities of Sambar&#160; (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Hunting and poaching has been more problematic in areas of Kerala, but it also has some very well protected areas and there is also constant in-migration from protected areas outside of Kerala, this is especially so in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve area (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. The situation outside&#160;protected areas&#160;in the three southern states is however often very different and “mostly in the red”, but there are a few exceptions, like the Valparai Plateau in Tamil Nadu where Sambar is very common, and can be found on private lands (Sridhar <em>et al. </em>2008, N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. In the southern Western Ghats in particular and some parts to the north of this, there has been no noticeable decline in Sambar distribution in the last twenty years (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). However there are indications, based on interview data that abundance has been declining in the Western Ghats (Pillay<em> et al.</em> 2011). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">In other central and east Indian states Sambar is “very rare”, “extremely patchy and in severe decline” “owing to severe hunting pressures, insurgency, rapidly spreading mines (both bauxite and iron-ore)” (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <br/></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The reported ecological densities of Sambar in India mostly fall within 1–10 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;within the protected area network, and depending on the varying levels of protection efficacy: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 0.89 +/- 0.23 (SE) per km<sup>2</sup> (Jathanna <em>et al.</em> 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 9.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 1.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 5.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 5.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Melghat dry deciduous forest, 2.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.9 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 10.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, two animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan et al. 1996). Similar surveys at Kaziranga found too few Sambar to estimate populations there (Karanth and Nichols 2000), this presumably representing habitat characters rather than defective protection, given the buoyant populations of other deer at that site (Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and forest-resource extraction (Jathanna <em>et al. </em>2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data as of 2008).<span lang=""EN-GB""> Local population trends in well protected reserves appear to be stable and even increasing in areas recently freed from anthropogenic pressures (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. But in poorly protected reserved forests subject to hunting and heavy cattle grazing, Sambar density seems to be extremely low; certainly too low to permit actual estimation of density (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">Outside protected areas, Sambar is present mostly in very low numbers, although larger numbers can still be found where its habitat is almost inaccessible to people (Anonymous 2008).<br/> <br/> Nepal supports an important population in Bardia National Park (Dinerstein 1979). This remains healthy and there are also good populations in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Across the country Sambar has declined so rapidly and so widely that it is now very rare outside protected areas, mostly recorded as isolated reports from forests adjoining these protected areas, and from south-east Nepal. Sambar has been victim of poachers, probably because of its large size (thus, more meat per animal and, for males, a more impressive trophy), perhaps compounded by nocturnal and relatively docile nature; recent declines are of the magnitude to meet IUCN criteria for Vulnerable on a national assessment (all information: Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). It is unclear whether the demand for antler in velvet in eastern Asia is stimulating poaching in Nepal.<br/> <br/> No information concerning current status was traced from Bhutan but (simply on an area basis) numbers are unlikely to be large enough to influence the overall global population trend.<br/> <br/> In Bangladesh, the Sambar was common in the north-east, south-east and hill-tract forests in the 1960s (Khan 1985) but now is restricted to the forest fragments of the southeast, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar occurrence in protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and eco parks) is now doubtful and all recent records and reports have come from outside protected areas from areas that were largely inaccessible to the majority of people prior to 1997 due to insurgency (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar was detected by camera-trapping at 22 of 38 surveyed grid cells (each &gt;50% forest cover&#160; and 10,000 ha) in the CHT during 2010-2011, but it was assumed that outside the survey area, Sambar was either absent or occurred in very low numbers (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Within the best two grid cells (rated in terms of forest cover, inaccessibility and presence of Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>) detection rate of Sambar was 2.07 independent photos/100 camera trap nights. Following the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladesh Government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (the political organization of CHT indigenous people) both the rate of habitat loss and hunting pressure have been accelerating in the period after 1997 (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). There is no sign of significant change in either factor in near future and if current habitat loss and hunting rates continue indefinitely extirpation of sambar is likely within the next 30 years (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""> In China there were major declines in Sambar over much of the twentieth century, and populations probably decreased by more than 50% in the 30 years from 1978 to 2008; records from Guangxi suggest that, there at least, the 1970s–1980s was the era of fastest decline (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008; B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). In some provinces populations seem now to have stabilized, and in some areas, particularly in Hainan (where several apparently stabilised populations are present, but all are small, reflecting habitat patch size: the largest may be of only a few hundred animals) and north Guangdong province (perhaps also the east of that province, where there is a nature reserve specifically for the species), populations may even have been increasing once again in the last few years. This is not so for Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Further north, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei, a multi-method Tiger survey in 2001 found that Sambar is very rare overall and scattered in present-day distribution (Tilson <em>et al.</em> 2004). For elsewhere in China, Smith and Xie Yan (2008) mapped wide presence in Sichuan, plus isolated populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, and Fujian. The original sources are not clear, and R. Harris (pers. comm.) doubts that Sambar has lived anywhere in Qinghai in recent times. <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, numbers and geographic distribution reduced rapidly through hunting before 1987, then expanded somewhat since the mid 1990s reflecting reductions in hunting. The average population density in the Yu-Li Wildlife Refuge was 10.6 animals per km² in 2005. In some areas at high altitude, densities exceed 40 animals per km², and the animals have a large impact on the coniferous saplings in this area. But at low to mid altitude, hunting pressure remains high enough to restrain their distribution and density. Based on the known geographical distribution, there are five populations: A-Yu Mountain, Nanhu, Shei-Pa, Jade Mountains–Central Mountains, and Tawu. The A-Yu population was re-introduced (about 70 animals) by local deer farmers in 1988–1991, when the velvet price was very low through the impact of deer TB in 1985. This population has not expanded reflecting continuous poaching; it may be genetically polluted. The other four populations are all natural, assumed to be isolated by cross-island roads, and may have very low gene flows with each other. Sambar is largely restricted to protected areas, only occurring outside them in a few nearby areas. The population sizes and distributions in these areas are smaller than in the protected areas. The poaching pressure is an important limitation to Sambar in these unprotected areas (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Myanmar, Sambar was detected at 12 of 15 camera-trapped Tiger sites during 1999–2002, indicating that it was still widespread (Lynam 2003). Sambar meat and antlers were commonly found in local markets in the Hukaung Valley in 2002 (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014) indicating heavy hunting pressure, possibly partially explaining extremely low densities of tigers in the area at that time (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; The Myanmar Forest Department and Wildlife Conservation Society have since jointly (as of May 2008) camera-trapped 21 survey areas (including the earlier 15) and found Sambar in 13 (S. Htun pers. comm. 2008). This lower ratio of proven presence indicates how the areas selected for Tiger survey were above average for prey and may indicate increasing local-level extinctions. For example, in a multi-method study of one area not expected to hold Tiger, hunted animals showed that Sambar still occurred in Naungmung and Machanbaw (south of Hkakaborazi National Park, Kachin state), but it was so scarce that it was not detected by substantial amounts of either camera trapping or sign surveys (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005). Even within these best areas, large declines are suspected and overall national population losses of about 50% over the last 25–30 years and in the following such period are likely (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006; Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Thailand, several protected areas maintain big Sambar populations; these are mostly large with very few or no people living within them. Over much of the country Sambar is extinct or very nearly so, including in many protected areas, particularly in the north where most parks are small and heavily poached (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is rare in most areas of Thung Yai Naresuan, where commercial hunting has targeted large ungulates (Steinmetz <em>et al. </em>2008). Sambar was recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations during a Leopard survey in Kaeng Krachan National Park, and clearly remains widespread there. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert et al. 2007). Sambar is also locally abundant in Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam et al. 2006), and the remote core zone of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). In Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary current Sambar density is about 2–3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and it seems to be increasing (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Lao PDR, Sambar was described as very common throughout the wooded parts by Delacour (1940). Some decades later, the species was reported during 86% of 1988–1993 village interviews (n = 328) and was then still widespread throughout, except in the most heavily settled areas (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999: Annex 5). However, sightings on surveys during 1992–1998 were very rare, and while calls heard by night and signs indicate a wide distribution, numbers are heavily depressed (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001). Only in Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA did Sambar seem at least locally abundant (Davidson 1998), and reasonable populations were confirmed still to persist in 2003–2004 (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004); an exceptional area in an Indochinese context, that still supported significant Tiger numbers in 2008 (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010). The Nakai Plateau and the mountainous interior of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and a few other, localized, areas of Lao PDR, including the Dong Kalo tract of Xe Pian NPA, the Nam Hiang area of the Bolaven Plateau, and parts of Nam Kading NPA also seemed to support relatively high densities during the mid 1990s. The few sites resurveyed during 2004–2007 have in general shown major declines (e.g. Timmins and Robichaud 2005). There was not a single camera-trap photograph during fairly intensive camera-trapping in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2007, although the species has subsequently been found to persist in a few parts of the protected area (Johnson and Johnston 2007; W.G. Robichaud and Nam Theun Watershed Management Protection Authority pers. comm. 2008) and it is not clear whether quirks of camera-trap placement (e.g., hypothetically, a focus on slopes rather than valley bottoms) may have been a major contributor to the lack of photographs. The Nakai Plateau still supports noteworthy numbers in a Lao context, but even here there were signs of decline (Dersu 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014) and no Sambar were camera-trapped in Xe Sap NPA during relatively extensive camera-trapping (~40 sites, ~5,000 trap-nights) in 2012 and 2013 (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). Surprisingly, given the proximity to China and Viet Nam, a good population was found to persist in Phou Dendin NPA in the far north-east of Lao PDR in 2004–2005 (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). In sites surveyed since 2008 evidence for persistence has been found in most large forest blocks (e.g. &gt;50,000 ha), although nowhere common, but generally not in small and isolated fragments, while in many areas of the country evidence suggests increasing levels of hunting especially commercial scale snaring (SUFORD 2010, Duckworth in press, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2014, 2009, in press b, Woxvold 2009, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Viet Nam, in most of the northern highlands, in particular, and all other areas of Viet Nam to an increasing extent, Sambar is very rare or has been hunted out from many areas of otherwise suitable habitat (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999; Grieser Johns 2000; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014; B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping studies in Pu Mat National Park, Thua Thien Hue province and Quang Nam province between 1998 and 2007 recorded only a handful of records and local communities in all these areas report a major decline in numbers (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Greater than 19,000 camera-trap nights from &gt;100 locations in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves detected the species from only one location (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). With so many higher-profile species long listed as threatened on the Red List, many of them with restricted ranges, the status of Sambar in Viet Nam has largely been ignored, and the paucity of evidence during many surveys has rarely been highlighted in reviews. As with many large mammals, populations were thought to be best in southern parts of the country, but even here hunting pressure is high in most remaining forest areas, and Sambar is thought to be scarce to extirpated in most remaining forest areas (a high proportion of which is within protected areas) (Timmins in press a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). It was not considered at all common in surveys of several areas of prime habitat in Dak Lak Province in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997). In a three week survey of forest in western Dak Nong Province only a single Sambar was detected on the basis of signs, this despite the area being contiguous with Seima PF in Cambodia (Timmins in press a). It remains locally common in Cat Tien National Park (Polet and Ling 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), but this is very much the exception to the species status in almost all protected areas in Viet Nam (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, Sambar “appears to be at least relatively common in some areas, though entirely absent from others, a feature which appears to have a strong correlation to local hunting pressure. At the current rate of persecution, this species is likely to decline sharply over the next few years (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the 2008 assessment Sambar was considered “still widespread, although heavily targeted by hunters and most populations are now very depressed (Timmins and Men 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, Timmins 2006)”. However substantial declines have certainly occurred since that time (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), as a result of increasing hunting pressure, especially in the east because of Vietnamese driven trade (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Timmins in press a), but elsewhere because of increasing ease of access to forest areas as a result of infrastructure development, settlement of frontier forest areas and agriculture and forestry concession developments (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). <span lang=""EN-GB"">In Seima PF, Phnom Prich WS, and Mondulkiri PF Sambar densities are considered too low to allow density and population estimation, although behaviour is also thought to contribute to the low detection rate on line transects there (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The population is almost certainly smaller even than that of wild oxen, and probably numbers in the low hundreds of animals (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). Sambar densities are low throughout the Eastern Plains (e.g. Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011; Timmins and Ou Ratanak 2001), almost certainly a result of targeted hunting in combination with the ecological association of Sambar with ‘edge’-type habitats and riparian corridors. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the eastern plains of Cambodia, where populations of many other ungulates were and still are magnitudes more numerous than in other areas of Indochina, Sambar numbers are clearly low, almost certainly as a result of targeted hunting: numbers in some areas seem depressed even well below those of wild cattle (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014;&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Gray <em>et al. </em>2013, 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins and Ou 2001). Protection activities in a few localised areas appeared initially to have stabilized declines up to c. 2008, but this was an exception to a general scenario of rapid decline, and now it appears that even in these reasonably well managed areas with significant resources input into protection and law enforcement activities that hunting pressure is rising in intensity, presumably largely because of the increasing lucrative nature of the trade in wildlife, rather than a decrease in protection efforts, augmented somewhat by the greater connectivity and better infrastructure connecting wildlife sources to markets (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, J. Khamler pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). These declines are evidently faster and more recent than in either Lao PDR or Viet Nam, reflecting the rapid pace of change of economic and logistical factors in Cambodia since the mid 1990s. Since the species' assessment in 2008 this rate of decline has almost certainly increased, perhaps even by an order of magnitude (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The primary reason for this increase has been the rapid economic growth that Cambodia has seen in the intervening period, particularly the rapid development of agro-industry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). This by itself would not necessarily lead to major declines in Sambar, but the infrastructural development associated with agricultural concessions has created easy access to huge areas of formerly relatively remote forest areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Even protected areas are not secure, with legal concessions granted within the former boundaries of even those with strong international support (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2014). At the same time illegal exploitation of the rich natural resources of Cambodia has increased, as commodity values have increased, as access to these resources has increased and as regional cross-border natural resource trade networks have become stronger (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Recent studies have confirmed what was earlier suspected that Sambar populations even in some of the areas of best wildlife status are highly depressed, but more worryingly however there are no signs of a significant recovery in such areas and hunting pressure may in fact be increasing despite concerted resource investment in protected area management, particularly law enforcement strategies, from international NGOs (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2011; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; S. Brook pers. comm. 2014; J. Kamler pers. comm. 2014). Although the rates of decline have been increasing in Cambodia, concurrently as the numbers of animals remaining have decreased, the influence of the Cambodian population status on the global population trend has probably changed little (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> For a review of the species status in Peninsula Malaysia Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2014) considered that the rate of decline was sufficient to warrant an Endangered listing, i.e. a 50% or greater decline. This conclusion was based on several lines of evidence, most notably the results of camera-trapping surveys showing absence and or low densities in a majority of remaining forest areas, and rates of forest loss. Camera-trapping studies between 1998 and 2008 over more than 20,000 trap days, detected Sambar (68 photographs) in only 3 of 18 Permanent Reserved Forests, but detected the species in all five protected areas surveyed (346 photographs in c. 19,900 trap-days) (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">), however the species was only commonly detected (e.g. capture rate &gt;1/25 trap nights) in two PAs Taman Negara K Koh and Endau Rompin and one PRF Temenggor. Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) like the majority of the studies that formed part of the synthesis of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>(2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">) was specifically aimed at Tigers and their prey, and hence camera-traps were set specifically with Sambar detection in mind, the results are thus particularly informative of Sambar status; during the study Sambar was photographed at only one of the nine areas surveyed during 1997–1999, Temenggor, where it was the most commonly photographed mammal (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In more recent studies from 2009 to 2013 totalling more than 40,000 trap days focused on three national priority tiger conservation landscapes Sambar was detected by camera-trapping in only four of ten forest units surveyed, with presence confirmed in another through observational surveys of signs, but was only commonly detected in one, Royal Belum State Park (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">). The high incidence of muntjac and pig pictures in both earlier and later periods of survey clearly indicate that the results are indicative of Sambar status rather than an issue with camera-trapping methodology. &#160;In the 1990s, Sambar was found in only one of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas) in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves, making it the most localized mammal species visually detected on forest transects (Laidlaw 2000, K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 2014). The occupied site was a logged area (Laidlaw 2000). None was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006; one of the 23 studies assessed by <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Camera-trapping and sign-based survey studies in Taman Negara NP have independently corroborated declines in Sambar numbers between c. 2000 and 2010 (<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

Sambar was found to be present but uncommon in the remaining areas of Mulu National Park (Sarawak), Pulong Tau National Park (Sarawak), the Ulu Padas region (Sabah), the Ulu Trusan region (Sarawak), and the Ulu Baram (Sarawak) (Brodie <em>et al.</em> in press, <span lang=""EN-US"">J.

Sambar has been extirpated or persists only at extremely low densities in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia (Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006). An intensive survey of Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, found Sambar only once; this was stated to be a genuine reflection of actual rarity, and to result from intensive hunting at salt-licks (Meredith 1995). Across Sarawak and to a lesser extent Sabah it is seriously reduced by hunting (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2000, see Threats; A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008), although persistence is probably still widespread (J.

Hedges pers. comm. 2008), but in these areas it was recorded rather rarely by comparison with other ungulates. Sambar was nearly six times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting, and reduced populations overall (O'Brien&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003). In Way Kambas National Park the population is reportedly stable (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Overall in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Sambar is not under major threat except where forest is being converted (i.e. most of the lowlands). Reflecting this, E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) considered the status of Sambar, in suitable habitat, to be much more healthy there than in Cambodia and Viet Nam, although there is a significant market for Sambar antlers in Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"The Sambar extends from India and Sri Lanka east along the southern Himalayas (including Nepal and Bhutan) through much of south China (including Hainan Island) to Taiwan (where it occurs in the central and eastern parts; Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comms. 2008). Further south it occurs in Bangladesh, throughout mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, West Malaysia) and many of the main islands of the Greater Sundas (excepting Java): Sumatra, Siberut, Sipora, Pagi and Nias islands (all Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) (Grubb 2005). The current distribution is now highly fragmented in much of this range (see Population). Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) also listed the Philippines, but the Sambar does not occur there. A record from Ujung Kulon, Java, in van Schaik and Griffiths (1996: 107) is presumably an error for Javan Deer <em>R. timorensis</em>. The Sambar has been introduced widely outside its native range, e.g.: San Luis Obispo Country, California; the Gulf Prairies and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Ables and Ramsey 1974); the St. Vincent Islands, Franklin Country, Florida (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1990); Australia (Slee 1984, Freeland 1990); New Zealand (Kelton and Skipworth 1987); and Western Cape Province, South Africa (Lever 1985). These introduced populations are not included on the distribution map.","The Sambar is hunted for sport, food, medicinal products and other purposes. It is uncertain how many captive animals are kept within the native range, potentially larger herds occur in countries where introduced, and the comparative contributions of wild and captive sourced products to markets is unknown - the markets may be somewhat separate.",Terrestrial,"The Sambar is found in many protected areas throughout its range, although in most of these areas this legal status has not stemmed declines and local extinctions from hunting. Similarly, although it is protected from hunting by legislation, even outside protected areas, in most or all range states, these laws are challenging to enforce, given the trade demand for meat and antlers (GMA Indonesia Workshop).&#160;In Sarawak, Borneo, unfortunately,&#160;Sambar&#160;is not on the protected list of Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1998 (a,b) (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Currently the law has a strong protective effect in Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008) and in various protected areas of India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, Sambar declines have lagged behind those of other sympatric deer (excepting muntjacs). There is no doubt that within a decade or two Sambar will be, like Hog Deer and Eld’s Deer are already, almost absent from South-east Asia unless effective protection from trade-driven hunting is instituted. In India the species’s status is less grim, and this is dependent upon continuation of the current protected areas system, and the expansion of effective threat reduction into a greater proportion of protected areas: in many Indian protected areas, poaching is rampant and in such vulnerable areas Sambar numbers are still declining. Given the major challenges combating hunting of such a desired animal, long-term survival is most realistic in large protected areas (exceeding 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> where possible), lacking people living within them, with an adequate number of motivated and capable staff (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008, A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). The precise ways for protected areas to function effectively in the conservation of large mammals depend upon their own specific circumstances, but field presence of staff, dispersed across the area, is likely to be important in almost every area. For example, Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2006) found in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, that encounter rates of tracks and signs of Sambar (and other large mammals) decreased with distance from ranger substations. Deep inside the forest to the south and east, far away from ranger substations, Sambar was locally extinct. Similar patterns are shown by current Sambar distributions in other Thai protected areas such as Khao Sok, Phu Khieo and Kaeng Krachan (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Sambar (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Sambar populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that outmigration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai. Most of the remaining forest within its Chinese range are already established as nature reserves (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Sambar population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Sambar presence through its historical range, to preserve Sambar genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/><p>The most important conservation measure for Sambar in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, and in Thailand it is to to expand government-funded park protection and ranger training programmes outside of the few parks which are currently well supported in the Western Forest Complex. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Sambar conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Nam Et–Phou Louey, and Nakai–Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species, but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Sambar conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Sambar as the focus for efforts.<br/> <br/> Captive breeding is being developed in East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). A captive herd of 223 heads in 10 ha enclosure was established in 1998 in Penajam District, as a pilot project. Several private herds exist in the province, such as at Bearau and at Nunukan, both with more than 20 heads (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Captive Sambar herds are also widespread in mainland Asia.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Typically, muskoxen live in mixed sex and age herds or small male bachelor herds which have home ranges within which muskoxen move between seasonal ranges. Although primarily grazers adapted to a diet of sedges and grasses, muskoxen also browse shrubs and forage selectively for forbs. They calve well before snow melt so lactation is supported by the cow’s fat reserves which the cow has to replenish during the brief summer. Muskoxen have a high threshold of fat reserves before conceiving which reflects their conservative breeding strategies. Winter ranges typically have shallow snow to reduce the energetic costs of digging through snow to reach forage. Muskoxen may also be susceptible to internal parasites but their role in muskox foraging ecology and population dynamics is unknown. The implications of the low genetic variability of muskoxen are likewise unknown.","Historically this species declined because of over-hunting, but population recovery has taken place following enforcement of hunting regulations. Management in the late 1900s was mostly conservative hunting quotas to foster recovery and recolonization from the historic declines. Currently, there is increasing realization that periodically on some arctic islands, die-offs of up to 40% of the island’s muskoxen occur when warmer fall weather leads to icing and deeper snow which restrict forage availability. On the North American mainland, typically muskoxen have expanded their range recolonizing historic ranges but behind the colonizing edge, abundance declines at least partially due to predation by wolves and grizzly bears. A persistent concern of people is that muskoxen through their presence (smell) and foraging are detrimental to caribou (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>). The environmental consequences of climate warming is likely to have an impact on this species.<br/><br/>In Greenland, there are no major threats, although the fact that populations are often small in size and scattered, make them vulnerable to local or regional fluctuations in climate. Most populations  are within the National Park, where they are protected from hunting. The portion of the population which is south of the National Park sustains a regulated quota harvest. Climate change in Northeast Greenland is expected to bring increased precipitation and milder winters, which might negatively affect the muskox population.","In Canada, estimated muskox numbers in the Northwest Territories total 75,400 (1991-2005) of which 93% occur on the large arctic islands of Banks and western Victoria. Nunavut has an estimated 45,300 animals, of which 35,000 occur on the Arctic islands (unpublished data). A few muskoxen from the transplanted population on the Alaskan North Slope have strayed into Yukon. In northern Quebec (outside their natural range), Le Henaff and Crete (1989) counted 290 muskoxen in 1986.<br/><br/>In Alaska, 3,714 animals were estimated from aerial and ground counts between 2001 and 2005: Nunivak Island 609; Nelson Island 318; Seward Peninsula 2050; northwest Alaska 369; northeast Alaska 268. The re-established herds either fluctuate or are increasing in size and range, and in some areas, local people are concerned that they will compete with caribou and reindeer. <br/><br/>The population size in Greenland in 1991 was estimated to number 9,500-12,500. Of this total, Boertmann <em>et al</em>. (1992) recorded the following population estimates: 1,000 to 1,500 in North Greenland between Newman bight (82°N, 55’W) and Nioghalvfjerdfjorden (79°N); around 35 animals in the northern East Greenland region between 79°N and Jokelbugten (78°N); 450 to 550 between 78°N and Ardencable fjord (75°N); 2,900 to 4,600 in the areas between 75°N and Kong Oscar Fjord (72°N), and 4,600 to 5,000 the southernmost part of the species’ natural range in East Greenland, between 72°N and Scoresby Sund (70°N) (although recent unpublished surveys suggest that the population here has been reduced to approximately 4,000 animals (P. Aastrup pers. comm. to M. Forchhammer).",Stable,"Historically (1800s), muskoxen occurred from Point Barrow, Alaska (USA) east across Canada to northeast Greenland, south to northeast Manitoba (Canada), with the current range reduced (Grubb 2005). In the Canadian Arctic, muskoxen inhabit most large islands (except Baffin Island) and the mainland tundra of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut from the coast of Hudson Bay west to almost the Mackenzie River and south to the tree line in the Northwest Territories and western Nunavut. Muskoxen  occur naturally over the entire Northeast and North Greenland west to Nyeboe Land. As well, there are several introduced populations, which are now well established in West Greenland and Qaannaaq. The species was re-introduced to Alaska (USA), and four locations in West Greenland (Denmark). Muskoxen were also introduced to Norway and Svalbard (Norway), although on Svalbard, they have since died out (Grubb 2005). The species occurred in Russia until around 2,000 years ago, and has been introduced to the Taimyr Peninsula and Wrangel Island.",The hunting of this species is now well regulated and is believed to be sustainable.,Terrestrial,"Unregulated commercial harvesting caused the disappearance of muskoxen from large areas of their Canadian continental ranges in the late 1880s and at the same time, ice storms probably reduced muskox numbers on Banks and western Victoria islands. After protection from hunting in 1917, muskoxen began to recover, and under the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Wildlife Act, are subject to aboriginal hunting limited by area-specific quotas and seasons. After 1980, the rights to hunt muskox could be transferred to non-aboriginal hunters for guided non-resident hunters and for commercial meat harvesting. In northern Canada, wildlife management is largely shifting from centralized government agencies to co-management boards and shared responsibility with aboriginal peoples. The wildlife management boards are developing management plans, and continue to regulate muskox hunting on the basis of sustainable yields. In the late 1990s, the annual quota for the NWT and Nunavut was 12,000 animals which includes 10,000 tags for Banks Island. The domestic harvest is relatively stable and while the commercial harvest for meat and hides (source of qiviut the fine underwool) annually varies, it averages about 1,000-2,000 muskoxen from Banks and Victoria islands. Management activities are mostly systematic aerial strip-transect surveys to track trends in population size, and as a basis for quota adjustments. No reserves are specifically set aside for muskoxen, but part of the rationale for establishing the Thelon Game Sanctuary was to protect a remnant muskox population from hunting. The species also occurs in three national parks: Quttinirpaaq (Ellesmere Island ), Aulavik (northern Banks Island) and Tuktu Nogait (Bluenose Lake,  western Arctic mainland). In national parks, land use activities are controlled, but aboriginal hunting is permitted subject to conservation provisions. Conservation measures proposed for Canada: 1) Maintain sufficiently frequent population monitoring to track trends in abundance and distribution. 2) Utilize environmental screening of individual developments to protect muskox ranges outside any formally protected areas. 3) Public education is essentially as muskox have recolonized large areas and many people are unfamiliar with muskox ecology and behavior. People are often concerned about effects of muskoxen on caribou especially in areas muskoxen have recolonized.<br/><br/>In the United States, all five extant populations are the result of re-introductions of the muskox within and outside its historic range. The re-introductions began in 1935 with the translocation of animals, originally from northeast Greenland, to Nunivak Island. From 1967 to the most recent transplants in 1970, the Nunivak island population has been the source for all other Alaskan translocations (Klein 1988). Fully protected by law, muskox occurs in five protected areas and hunting is allowed under permit, with limited quotas on three of the five populations. Local subsistence hunting is given preference. Its status within the country is Not Threatened. <br/><br/>In Greenland, muskoxen occur in four protected areas, with indigenous populations in the vast Northeast Greenland National Park, and three introduced populations in Arnangarnup Qoorua Nature Reserve, and Kangerlussuag and Maniitsoq Caribou Reserves. Within these protected areas, muskox receives full protection. Most natural populations are within Northeast Greenland National Park. Outside protected areas, controlled hunting is allowed on Jameson Land in East Greenland, and near Kangerlussuaq in West Greenland. In both, quotas are determined annually and hunting is permitted only by full-time subsistence hunters. Between 1963 and 1991, muskoxen were translocated to three areas in the southwest previously uninhabited by muskox (near Kangerlussuaq, central West Greenland; Nunavik Peninsula, West Greenland; and Ivittuut, south Greenland), and a fourth population was reintroduced into former muskox range in Avanersuaq (Thule) in north-western North Greenland. Conservation measures proposed for Greenland: A proposal for development of a long-term management plan for existing muskox populations in West Greenland, is presently being considered by the Home Rule administration. A new system of game wardens in the West Greenland region, between Disko Bay (68°30’N) and Paamiut icecap (62°30’N), is being established to strengthen the enforcement of renewable resource legislation, and to control the performance of hunters in general.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Observed decline is due to government-implemented mass culls in 2015 and 2016, illegal hunting and killing by the local population, and accidental mortality on powerlines. Projected declines are based on: i) continued hunting and culling pressures combined with reduced legal protection of the species; ii) continuing reduction in the extent and quality of forest, a key habitat that is relied upon for roosting and foraging); and iii) likelihood of a major cyclone occurring on Mauritius within three generations.<strong></strong></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Most known roost sites are in forest, mostly in the more forested parts of mountain ranges, in secure places with restricted access, on the leeward side and generally without exposure to full sun (Sookhareea 2011), but roosts are also found in forest remnants all over the island (Oleksy 2015). Roost sites number a few hundred trees (since each roost consists of a few tall trees), with accessible canopy structures, and with terminal branches strong enough to bear the weight of a few large bats. Favoured trees genera and tree species are a mixture of native and exotic species: <em>Eucalyptus </em>spp., Tecoma (<em>Tabebuia pallida</em>), <em>Araucaria </em>spp., Bois noir (<em>Albizia lebbek</em>), and the endemic Bois de natte (<em>Labourdonnaisia glauca</em>). A substantial roost site was also located in the<span lang=""EN""> Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden, Pamplemousses, prior to the cull of 2015.<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;However, the roost is seasonal, with a major colony arriving around October-November which coincides with the fruiting season. During the dry season (April-September) only a few bats are present.<br/><br/>Roost sites represent day resting places. Many individuals collect at these roost sites, but the bats are highly vagile and move often from roost to roost, often over large distances and for a variety of reasons, such as disturbance, changes in prevailing wind, food availability, stage of the reproductive cycle. Satellite telemetry has shown that, during the night, the bats may travel up to 92 kilometres around the island to forage in different habitats, including human habitation and orchards. After foraging, they may return to their original roost or switch to new localities (Oleksy 2015).&#160; Roosts in the north-west of the island are much more heavily used during the dry season (August–December). So, although roosts are often historic and used over many years, the number of bats using them can fluctuate markedly (and they may be deserted for part of the year), as happens with historic roosts after a major disturbance. Thus, although the roost sites are very important for conservation, and should be treated as such regarding their contribution to the maintenance of the population, they cannot be treated as individual units for a Red List assessment. In view of the nature of the major threats and the way the bats move around the island nightly and among roost sites, it is not possible to define any number of discrete locations within Mauritius: it is considered that the number of locations for this species is one, corresponding to the island of Mauritius. Moreover, mitochondrial sequence data from individuals from four roosts on the island indicate that the population is likely to be panmictic (Larsen <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Half the plant species that have been identified as contributing to the diet of the species are native and half exotic (Nyhagen 2004, Nyhagen <em>et al. </em>2005). However, recent studies indicate that fruit bats feed on more native and endemic fruits than previously known (Florens <em>et al</em>. 2017a), as well as leaves and blossoms (Oleksy 2016). The breeding season starts around May and the young are born during August to December, when commercial fruits such as mango and litchi are fruiting. Because both crops are widespread in Mauritius the bats feed on them widely, foraging in plantations (orchards), small holdings and gardens. Without the mix of natural food sources and some exotic food sources it is likely that the population and breeding success of the bats will decline to some extent. During May-July (mid dry season) bats have been found dead under the roosts, probably due to food shortages (R. Oleksy, pers. obs.) as has been suggested by autopsy reports (V. Tatayah, pers. obs.). Thus, there is a strong reliance on forest, both for roosting and for foraging.&#160;</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is threatened by:&#160; a) habitat destruction and decline in quality, specifically the loss of roosting and feeding trees; b) invasive alien plants that reduce flowering and fruiting of trees and animal species, namely monkeys, that destroy food resources, especially fruits; c) cyclones; d) persecution in response to conflict over fruit crops; e) illegal hunting; and f) accidental deaths e.g., electrocution on powerlines. These threats commonly interact.<br/><br/><em>a). Habitat destruction and decline in quality</em>:<br/>There are no data on threats to specific roost sites, although there has been a progressive net loss of larger native trees within protected forests (Florens <em>et al.</em> 2017b). Losses include the commonly used roost tree <em>Labourdonnaisia glauca</em>. Decline of large trees is probably even faster in the more invaded forest (which consist of about two thirds of the remaining ‘native’ forests). Threats to bats at roost sites in Mauritius (e.g., hunting, cyclones, human disturbance) can impact many roosts at one time and in no pattern. In the case of an intense cyclone, a very large number of roosts can be damaged at the same time, and the roosts damaged will depend on details of the movement of the cyclone and its strength.<br/><br/>Forest habitats suitable for roosting and important for feeding, particularly at certain times of year, have seen major decline of what is already a habitat much depleted in both area and quality. Native forests are highly fragmented (Safford 1997, Florens 2013) and dominated by invasive alien plants, particularly in the wet forests (Florens 2008, Florens <em>et al.</em> 2016). The total extent of forest cover in Mauritius is <em>c</em>. 25% of total land area, but much of this is planted forests and shrubland (14%). Only about 5% is native forest (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2015), of which only one third (1.7%) is has more than 50% native canopy cover. The remaining native forest (3.3%) has less than 50% native canopy cover (Safford 1997, Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security 2015). In 2013, the extent of native forest with &gt; 50% plant canopy cover, so of “reasonable quality”, was estimated at around 2,600 ha (Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security 2015). While the significant holdings by government have shown little decline in recent years, natural habitat on private holdings has declined, and that decline is likely to continue. Illegal habitat destruction has also been recorded in Mauritius, even in protected areas, including some prime foraging habitats like the Cabinet Nature Reserve (Florens 2013). Declining habitat quality in the remaining protected areas is also of great concern. Density of large trees (&gt;10 cm diameter) has roughly halved in about 70 years even in lesser invaded and protected native forests (Florens <em>et al.</em> 2017b). This equates to a rate of loss of about 5% large tree density per generation of <em>P. niger</em>, with likely consequences for the island’s <em>P. niger </em>carrying capacity. Although potential foraging area for bats has increased following the wider introduction of fruit farms, especially for litchi and mango, these are only available for a short period of the year (October-December). Most of the year, the bats would not survive without forest foraging. Moreover, foraging on fruit crops has brought the species into conflict with people and precipitated persecution by individuals and government-implemented mass culls.<br/><br/><em>b). Invasive plant and animal species</em>:<br/>Invasion of native forests by alien plants is of conservation relevance to <em>Pteropus niger sub</em>populations on Mauritius as it reduces production of flowers and fruits among natives (Monty <em>et al.</em> 2013), including those that produce fruits taken by <em>P. niger </em>(Nyhagen <em>et al.</em> 2005, Baider and Florens 2006, Krivek 2017). <span lang=""EN-US"">Introduced Crab-eating Macaques (<em>Macaca fascicularis</em>) further reduce the abundance of native fruits available to <em>P. niger, </em>taking fruits of key species before they ripen enough for bat consumption (Nyhagen 2004). For example, Baider and Florens (2006) reported losses &gt; <span lang=""EN-US"">95% of all the fruits of <em>Sideroxylon grandiflorum</em> (Sapotaceae), an endemic canopy tree reliant upon <em>P. niger </em>for seed dispersal. They observed similar levels of damage to unripe fruit for several ebony species, e.g., the common Black Ebony (<em>Diospyros tessellaria</em>) and the rarer <em>D. nodose</em>, and for <em>Mimusops maxima</em> (Sapotaceae), another important canopy tree of wet forests. These trees are important native fruit trees for <em>P. niger</em>, that tends to eat mostly ripe fruit (Krivek 2017). <a name=""_Hlk491861085"">The population of macaques was reduced to an estimated 8,000 animals between 2006-2007, as wild animals were trapped for export for medical research (Sussman <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, macaque numbers have increased over the last decade, </a><span lang=""EN-US"">with censuses suggesting a wild population of 30,000<span lang=""EN-US"">–40,000 (Trask <em>et al.</em> 2013), and more recent estimates of 50,000.<br/><br/>The immediate and cumulative effects of invasive plants and monkeys combined limit the abundance of native fruits available to bats in the forest remnants. Moreover, only 500 ha or so of Mauritian native vegetation has been freed from alien plants out of the 90-km square or so (i.e., less than 4% of native vegetation is recovering from alien plant invasion – but not of monkey impacts). The vast majority of the native vegetation (96%) continues to degrade under the impact of invasive plants <span lang=""EN-US"">(Florens <em>et al</em>. 2017b)<span lang=""EN-US"">.<br/><br/><em>c). Cyclones</em>:<br/>Cyclones cause direct mortality to island fruit bats, destroy roost trees, and reduce fruit and flower resources resulting in starvation and/or compromised reproduction (McConkey <em>et al.</em> 2004). Dramatic population declines/extirpation following cyclones have been observed in island <em>Pteropus </em>populations in Tonga (McConkey <em>et al.</em> 2004), Samoa (Craig and Syron 1992, Craig <em>et al</em>. 1994), Christmas Island (Richards and Hall 2012), and neighboring Rodrigues. Cheke and Dahl (1981) report previous declines of <em>P. niger </em>on Mauritius<em> </em>following cyclones Carol (1960) and Claudette (1979), based on accounts from hunters and a report by Jones (1980). Mauritius has been hit by at least 38 cyclones (winds &gt; 120 km/hr) in the last 86 years (one cyclone every 2.26 years). This gives a mean of 8-9 such cyclones during three generations (taken as 20 years) among which an average of at least two have devastating winds exceeding 210 km/hr.&#160; In the previous 20 years (three generations), the Mauritius Meteorological Services reported 11 cyclones/severe tropical storms, of which four were classified as intense (sustained winds &gt; 159 km/hr) or very intense (&gt; 210 km/hr). Although the last very intense tropical cyclone was in 2002, the risk remains high and recent trends and climate change forecasts suggest that frequency of strong cyclones is on the increase (Webster <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kuleshov <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kuleshov 2014). Maximum wind speeds are also likely to increase (Elsner <em>et al</em>. 2008, Deo and Ganer 2014) as is the rate at which cyclones intensify (Kishtawal <em>et al</em>. 2012). Climate change simulations for Mauritius further suggest a decrease in rainfall (Howells <em>et al</em>. 2013), which would likely negatively affect the availability of fruit and flower resources and lower the island’s carrying capacity.<br/><br/><em>d). Persecution in response to conflict over fruit crops</em>:<br/>Foraging on soft fruits has brought <em>P. niger </em>into conflict with fruit growers, both “backyard” and commercial, particularly during the litchi season in November-early January. Pressure from fruit growers resulted in a mass cull of the species by the Government from November-December 2015. The cull was carried out by Special Mobile Force using rifles of 0.22 calibre, and 26,225 cartridges 12 bore were used. Although the original target figure was 20% of the population (Anon. 2015), the total reported by the Commission of Police, as communicated by Honourable M. Seeruttun, the Minister of Agro-Industry and Food Security in Parliamentary Debate of 24 May 2016 (Anon. 2016) was 30,938. Per the Minister’s response, “the culling of bats was carried out in various regions throughout the island where bats exist, and these regions are mainly forest areas on both State and private lands. The island was split into four regions: the northern, southern, western and central eastern regions, and the culling exercise was carried out on different sites in those regions”.&#160; The December 2016 cull killed 7,380 bats (Anon. 2017). During the 2015 cull, although bats were still protected from private action, illegal take of bats for sport or control increased from an estimated 2,000 bats per year (Hutson and Racey 2013) to about 5,000 individuals (<a href=""http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org"">www.mauritian-wildlife.org</a>), and possibly as many as 6,000 (V. Tatayah, pers. comm). Collectively, losses since October 2015 – January 2017 are <em>c</em>. 50% ((38,318 bats culled + 10,000 illegal take + 2,000 powerline fatalities)/2015 pre-cull population of 99,438) (Vincenot <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Although <em>P. niger </em>was&#160;protected under law by the Wildlife and National Park Act of 1993, in the 20+ years of legal protection, no fines were levied on those taking bats illegally (Florens 2013).&#160; The Wildlife and National Park Act of 1993 was repealed by the Native Terrestrial Biodiversity and National Parks Act (2015). Although the species is still protected from hunting, Clause 36 allows establishment of a Special Technical Committee specifically for “the purpose of controlling wildlife” that has attained “pest status”, and it was under this Clause that the culls of 2015 and 2016 were enacted. This erosion of protection for <em>P. niger </em>increases the ease and hence probability that the government will continue to implement future culls. Assessment of the species will be implemented should other culls take place.<br/><br/>The Sugar Protocol, which gave <span lang=""EN"">African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States<span lang=""EN-US""> (ACP) countries<span lang=""EN""> preferential access to the EU market, expired in 2009. Consequently, there has been some conversion of land from sugar cane production to other uses, including fruit crops (Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security 2015).&#160; This suggests that fruit grower-bat conflicts are likely to persist (and possibly increase) over the next three generations, unless mitigation measures are adopted (netting of trees, planting dwarf varieties, pruning). Given the weakened legal protection, and continuing conflict with fruit-growers, future government-implemented culls are considered probable, and illegal killing of bats by the public likely to remain at current levels (at least 5,000 per year) without explicit intervention.<br/><br/><em>e). Hunting</em>:<br/>Hutson and Racey (2013) estimated that illegal take of bats for sport or control was <em>c</em>. 2,000 bats per year. Since the 2015 cull, although bats were still protected from private action, illegal take of bats for sport or control increased to an estimated 5,000 individuals (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org"">www.mauritian-wildlife.org</a>), and possibly as many as 6,000. This offtake by hunters contributes to a sizeable annual mortality rate that will influence the long-term viability of the population. Therefore, it is important to devise methods to estimate the figure with greater accuracy and to reduce the number through enforcement and management of public perceptions.<br/><br/><em>f). Accidental deaths</em>:<br/>It is estimated that approximately 1,000-2,000 bats land and die on power lines each year (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org"">www.mauritian-wildlife.org</a>, V. Tatayah, pers. obs.). In addition, several hundred to a thousand bats die each year in poorly-set nets used to exclude bats from fruit crops. Bats become entangled in slack nets and die of dehydration, starvation or are actively persecuted and killed by people.&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>There has been a range of population estimates (of total number of individuals on Mauritius) with the first estimate of 10,000 individuals in 1974 (Cheke and Dahl 1981). A.S. Cheke (pers. comm. 2012) admits that this was a crude estimate based on counts of a few colonies and talks with hunters and other anecdotal sources<a name=""_Hlk494359517"">. </a><a name=""_Hlk495316838""></a><a name=""_Hlk495316272"">Robin (2007) identified 54 occupied roosts, of which 36 were categorized during pre-assessment into size classes (&lt;300, 300-600, 600-900, &gt; 900). 24 of the 36 sites were selected in a stratified random design for evening dispersal counts (two sites for each size class from each of three geographic regions [East, West, North]). Based on the counts from the 24 sites sampled twice, she estimated that the population of the 36 sites to be about 15,700 bats. This is a partial population estimate as it did not account for bats roosting at the remaining 18 </a>known sites. The Mauritian government has carried out counts since 2003, and data are available for 2006, 2010, 2013 and 2016. These give figures of 22-25,000 for 2006, 49-56,000 for 2010 (Sookhareea 2011), and 92,000 for 2013 (NPCS 2013) using a range of methods, but predominantly disturbance counts. These figures were questioned by the IUCN SSC Bat Specialist Group because of widespread use of disturbance counts. In disturbance counts, the colony to be counted is disturbed by a loud noise (such as a fire cracker under the roost) that causes the bats to disperse. Most animals fly out at the same time and in multiple directions, so standardized counts are challenging. Moreover, recent satellite telemetry data suggest that bats move widely across the island within and among nights (Oleksy 2015). Similarly, repeated counts of Robin (2007) over successive days, as well as separated by several weeks, exhibited high variance. Both disturbance counts and among-roost movements can lead to an over-estimation of the population. In 2016, the population was surveyed by the National Parks and Conservation Service (NPCS) using only evening dispersal counts and roost counts. To minimize error from movement of bats among roosting areas, the 2016 survey was conducted over three weeks, a shorter period than in previous years, and several roosts were counted simultaneously, although nightly movement of bats among roosts could not be accounted for. The 2016 population was estimated at 62,500 (+/- 7 % due to observer error) which gives an upper bound of 66,875, lower 58,125.<br/><br/>Although there is some variability in the timing and methods of counts from 2003 to 2016, they provide good evidence that the population was increasing prior to the 2015 cull, although the scale of that increase is uncertain. An increase is likely since there was no significant cyclone in that period, and major cyclones result in heavy losses, from which the population is slow to recover. The number of known roost sites has also increased from <em>c</em>. 14 in 2003 (Nyhagen 2004) to <em>c</em>. 54 (Robin 2007, Sookhareea 2011), 63 in 2013 (NPCS 2013), and 83 in 2016. In 2007 a small subpopulation (10-20 animals) was identified on Réunion (where the species formerly occurred, but has been extinct for well over 100 years). These animals are generally assumed to have blown over from Mauritius (as suggested for other stray individual records since 2000), although it is possible they were released from a captive colony following the closure of Parc Zoologique de Saint Denis in 2006-7 (V. Tatayah pers. comm.). The population was recently estimated at about 40 individuals (Probst and Sanchez 2015). However, breeding appears limited and erratic on Réunion, so this subpopulation has not been considered for the purposes of this assessment.<br/><br/>In October-November 2015, the government of Mauritius implemented a cull, and reported that 30,938 bats were killed (Anon. 2016). From this, and the 2016 NPCS survey of 62,500, the pre-cull 2015 population was at least 93,438 individuals (62,500 + 30,938). To this we add a conservative estimate of 5,000 individuals killed illegally in 2015 (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org"">www.mauritian-wildlife.org</a>), either hunting for sport or food or trapped in nets, and a further 1,000 powerline fatalities (<a href=""http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org"">www.mauritian-wildlife.org</a>) to calculate total estimated fatalities in 2015 as 36,938 individuals.<br/><br/>This suggests that the pre-cull population of 2015 was <em>c</em>. 99,438 individuals (2015 combined fatalities + 2016 population estimate). From this baseline of 99,438 individuals, the 2015 fatalities (36,938 individuals) represented 37.15% of the 2015 population. This does not account for off-site mortality of animals injured during the cull or mortality of orphaned young (the cull occurred in the middle of the breeding season). A second cull was implemented in December 2016, killing a further 7380 individuals (Anon. 2017). Illegal killing and powerline fatalities are conservatively estimated at 6000 in 2016, thus total population losses from October 2015 to January 2017 reached 50% ((38,318 bats culled + 10,000 illegal take 2,000 powerline fatalities)/2015 pre-cull population of 99,438).<br/><br/>If illegal killing and powerline fatalities remain at 6,000 per year, population growth models indicate that the species could be reduced by 64-80% within the next 12-20 years, depending on model assumptions. Life history and fecundity data are limited for <em>Pteropus niger, </em>so model parameters were based on those of <em>P. poliocephalus</em> as reported in McIlwee and Martin (2002). The most conservative assumptions were made, that is, the highest values for survival and fecundity were selected and fecundity was assumed not to decline in old age. Specifically, we assumed only 30% mortality of individuals in their first year, and 10% thereafter until year 15 when all remaining individuals died. Note these are background mortality rates, and do not include deaths from powerlines or illegal killing. We modeled that 20% of females bred in their second year, and 90% in the third year until 15 years and females gave birth to a maximum of one young per year.&#160; This generated a generation time of 6.67 years and the maximum (or intrinsic) rate of increase per capita, <em>r<sub>max</sub>,</em> of 0.122 (comparable to that of models in McIlwee and Martin 2002, as would be expected). These values were used in a simple logistic growth model to evaluate the consequence of annual offtake (mortality arising from human activities) of 6000 a year. Evidence of starvation was detected in dead bats collected in 2015, prior to the cull (V. Tatayah, pers. obs.), when the population is inferred to be less than 100,000. As 2015 was a drought year, carrying capacity was generously estimated at 150,000 individuals. With a starting population of 62,500, carrying capacity of 150,000, and offtake of 6,000 individuals per year and an additional 7,380 individuals removed by the cull of 2016, the population declines by 82% (to <em>c</em>. <span lang=""EN-US"">17,703) of the pre-culls value of 2015 in 16 years (2031), or in 2.4 generations. This threshold is reached within 12 years (2027) if carrying capacity is modeled at 100,000 individuals. <span lang=""EN-US"">These models assume constant mortality (of 6,000 per year), but it is likely that bats will prove more elusive as populations decline. A constant proportion model, in which anthropogenic mortality is 10% of the population total each year with a starting population of 62,500 and including the 2016 cull of 7,380, reported a reduction by 64% (K = 150,000) and 72% (K = 100,000) of pre-cull numbers within three generations. Because of the uncertainty of the level of illegal offtake current and projected, we assess the species conservatively as Endangered. However, we highlight these are simple models that do not account for environmental stochasticity, such as the probability of extreme weather events, especially cyclones, or the implementation of additional culls. Either event will trigger reassessment as they would likely precipitate population declines approaching 80% over three generations (2015-2034), justifying an assessment of Critically Endangered.</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species was extirpated from Réunion in the early eighteenth century, and until recently has been restricted to the western Indian Ocean island of Mauritius (Bergmans 1999, Cheke and Hume 2008). <a name=""_Hlk495317356"">There are, however, recent records of a small subpopulation (<em>c</em>. 40 individuals) on Réunion from naturally recolonizing or released individuals (Probst and Sanchez 2015), so the species is no longer considered extinct on Réunion. </a>Cheke and Hume (2008) consider it possible that bats reported by Leguat in Rodrigues in 1691-1692 (Leguat 1708) might have been this species.</p>","This species is locally used for s<span lang=""EN-US"">port hunting and as a source of food.",Terrestrial,"<p><u><strong>Current conservation efforts<br/></strong></u><strong><u><br/></u></strong>This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.

Along with NPCS, ERA is testing organic repellents as well as sound systems to deter bats in orchards- non-lethal net free solution.<br/><br/>In June 2017, a joint initiative “The people, bats and fruit industry of Mauritius: a process towards a common solution” was launched by the IUCN SSC Task Force on Human-Wildlife Conflict, with the Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security, (Government of Mauritius), and the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF), in consultation with representatives of the fruit-growing industry, the IUCN SSC Bat Specialist Group, and members of the scientific community in Mauritius and overseas. The parties proposed an Action Plan that focused on a netting to manage fruit bat damage to orchards, development of a national research strategy, and mediated dialogues.<br/><br/><em>1. Net Benefits Initiative<br/></em>A two-day stakeholder workshop on netting and management of fruit bat damage to orchards was held in August 2017 (Zimmerman <em>et al.</em> 2017). The meeting was hosted by the Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security via its Food and Agricultural Research Extension Institute (FAREI) and participants were drawn from small orchard owners, commercial orchard managers, netting importers and distributors extension officers and research staff from FAREI, researchers and staff of NPCS and MWF, fruit exporters, and fruit traders. In addition to the Mauritian participants, five specialists from overseas participated: lychee farmers with successful experience in netting against bats in Australia, an expert in fruit bat ecology and bat damage prevention from Thailand, and human-wildlife conflict experts from the IUCN SSC Task Force on Human Wildlife Conflict, and Chester Zoo. The workshop comprised presentations, site visits and breakout sessions wherein working groups discussed key issues and strategies for reducing damage by bats and improving lychee productivity more generally. Resulting recommendations focused on: 1. Nets and netting – provision of white, 40% UV-treated small mesh-size nets and assistance with materials/construction of net frames. 2. Pruning of fruit trees – to a maximum of 4 m (ideally 2 m). 3. Equipment and training – mechanisms for assistance with equipment hire or purchase needed. 4. Model orchards – of two types: a) existing orchards modified to improve production and ease of netting; and b) new orchards planted and managed to provide optimum production, ease of harvest and netting. 5. Development of export markets for tropical fruit – recognizing that to be competitive in overseas markets crops must be ethically sourced. 6. Backyard growers – behavior change (uptake of net use) requires peer-behavior incentive measures (social marketing, development of new social norms). 7. Continued dialogue and collaborative action.<br/><br/><em>2. Research Strategy<br/></em>A workshop is planned to identify the knowledge and research needs for managing the Mauritius fruit-bat conflict in the long-term. Participants will produce a jointly-designed research needs strategy, determine a plan of action and sequence of priorities, and build collaborations to tackle each action in turn going forward.<br/><br/><em>3. Mediated dialogues<br/></em>To resolve additional conflicts and build lasting working relationships.<br/><br/><u><strong>Conservation needs/priorities<br/></strong></u><strong><u><br/></u></strong>There is a clear need to maintain monitoring of the population size, population dynamics, and response to cyclones. The basic biology of <em>Pteropus niger </em>remains quite poorly known, and data are urgently needed to parameterize population growth and viability models. Specifically, studies that detail life history and demographic information, especially age-specific fecundity and mortality rates, and that quantify illegal offtake (hunting/killing) and mortality due to powerlines and net entanglement, are critical for modeling population viability. Regular surveys provide insights into population dynamics and a means by which conservation interventions could be assessed.<br/><br/>Similarly, the intensity of other threats need to be quantified and ultimately reduced. Notably, competition with non-native frugivores and the effect of degradation and invasive plants on food availability in native forests, as these factors affect carrying capacity. Hunting and persecution need to be reduced through enforcement of the existing law that protect bats from public action (Native Terrestrial Biodiversity and National Parks Act 2015), and campaigns to change the public perceptions of bats. Public perceptions are entrenched and polarized, so research into campaign strategies that might prove effective is needed before widespread implementation.&#160; Ecological studies that can feed in to such campaigns include research into dietary phenology and movement ecology to provide further insights into the importance of <em>P. niger </em>as an agent of dispersal and pollination of the island’s native flora, as well as the extent, distribution and timing of <em>P. niger</em>’s<em> </em>exploitation of fruit crops.<br/><br/>The culls of 2015 and 2016 were precipitated by conflicts with fruit-growers, particularly litchi growers. Although there have been both government (FAREI 2015) and independent (Oleksy 2016) evaluations of fruit loss to bats, continued long-term multi-site studies of the intensity of fruit crop-offtake by bats relative to other sources of loss (birds, fungi, wind) are needed. Bats will take some proportion of fruit crops, but use of dwarf varieties and pruning, and protection of crops with nets can reduce losses to marginal economic relevance. Sustainable resolution of this conflict is a conservation priority, and it is critical that the recent initiative “The people, bats and fruit industry of Mauritius: a process towards a common solution” (see Conservation Actions) continue and that there is follow-up and implementation of recommendations arising (e.g., Zimmerman <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Overgrazing is a factor across many parts of the range.,"In 2008 total numbers were estimated at less than 12,000: Oman: approximately 13,000 were estimated in the late 1990s, including 10,000 on  the Jiddat al Harasis, although this population has been declining since  then; Saudi Arabia: 1,500-1,700, with 1,000 of these on the  Farasan Islands, over half on Farasan Kebir; Yemen: no  estimates available but it is usually described as rare here.<br/><br/>The largest population in Oman has been subject to heavy poaching for several years and is suspected to be much reduced.

In Saudi Arabia the species occurs on the  Farasan Islands, has been reintroduced to the Uruq Bani Ma'arid, Mahazat as Sayd, and Ibex Reserves, and there are some scattered  populations in the western mountains. In Oman it is widely distributed, with the largest  population in the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary and Jiddat al Harasis. Populations in the United Arab Emirates are small and scattered.

Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is above the threshold of 20,000 km², however the species is known from fewer than 10 locations and there is continuing decline in population size underway; it is suspected that a decline of&#160; &gt;10% will occur over the next three generations (estimated at 21 years). Therefore, the species almost qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion B1. This is a difficult species to assess because of its unclear taxonomic status. Its range is relatively small and it is a narrow endemic regardless of its taxonomic status; observed and projected declines justify maintaining the category Near Threatened.</p>","<p>Eastern tur inhabit elevations between 1,000 and 4,000 m a.s.l. Although the mountains in their range can reach 5,000 m asl, Tur seldom rise above 3,500 m asl. They live in forests found up to 2,600 m, and in subalpine and alpine meadows and rocky talus slopes at higher elevations. Animals avoid thick forests on gentle slopes, but stay readily in open forests growing on steep precipitous slopes. During winter, the proportion of animals dwelling below timberline increases (Veinberg 1984). On average, 34% of Eastern tur lived in the forest throughout the year in Georgia (Ekvtimishvili 1952). Some forest-dwelling populations in Azerbaijan may be completely (Vereshchagin 1938), or more possibly semi-isolated from subalpine and alpine zones. In summer, adult males typically inhabit higher altitudes than females and young (Veinberg 1984). During the harsh winters, tur concentrate on sunny slopes; during the summer, animals expand their distribution to slopes of different exposures (Veinberg 1984, Zalikhanov 1967, Magomedov<em>et al</em>. 2001). Seasonal migrations rarely exceed 5 km (Veinberg 1984, Zalikhanov 1967). Eastern tur consume 256 plant species in Daghestan (Abdurakhamanov 1977).<br/> <br/> Animals form mixed, adult male-female groups in November, just prior to rut. These disband by mid-January or the beginning of February at the latest and adult males and females live separately until the next rutting season (Veinberg 1984). Females give birth predominantly to just one kid (Veinberg 1984). Proportion of kids may exceed 20% in Azerbaijan (Kuliyev 1981) and Daghestan (Magomedov<em>et al.</em> 2001), but reach only 16.5% in North Ossetia, while yearlings make above 7% there (Veinberg 1984). Sex ratio favours males in protected populations (Weinberg 2002a). Mortality is about 60% in juveniles (Veinberg 1984), and about 20% in animals 1-9 years old, being higher in males than females (Magomedov et al. 2001). </p>  <p>Yearly changes of overall group size depends on the reproductive cycle. Rugged and precipitous terrain reduces group size (Veinberg 1984, Weinberg 2004). Mean group size also correlates with population density (Magomedov<em>et al</em>. 2001). Overall mean group size is below 10 in North Ossetia (Veinberg 1984), but reached ca. 78 in Azerbaijan (Kuliyev 1981). Average population density varies from 0.15 to 17 animals/km² (Weinberg 2002c). </p>  <p>Eastern Tur serve as prey to wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> and lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em>, and are also killed by snow avalanches. However, the significance of these factors differs along the species ranges. Snow avalanches cause most natural deaths among adult animals in the Central Caucasus (Veinberg 1984, Zalikhanov 1967) but not so in less snowy Daghestan, where wolf is the main natural enemy (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2001). Golden eagles <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em> and, supposedly, bearded vulture <em>Gypaetus barbatus</em> hunt newborn and small juveniles (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2001, Veinberg 1984). </p>  <p>Eastern Tur coexist with Caucasus chamois <em>Rupicapra r. caucasica</em> on the northern slope in the Central Caucasus and on the southern slope in the Eastern Caucasus (mainly Azerbaijan), but the latter is much less numerous; in Daghestan and Chechnya, it is sympatric with the wild goat <em>Capra aegagrus</em>, which dominates in the forest but seldom rises above timberline (Weinberg 1999).</p>","Poaching and livestock grazing are the major threats to the Eastern Tur, combined with the impacts of severe winters. Poaching is probably the most significant cause of the recently observed serious declines. Livestock grazing results in competition for resources, especially with domestic sheep and goats. The species is also impacted by habitat loss and degradation (NACRES 2017, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997).","<p>Following a period of increase between the 1940s and 1960s numbers have since declined. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the total numbers were estimated to be between 25,000 to 30,000 animals (Kuliyev 1981, Ravkin 1975), but by the late 1980s had declined by &gt;30% to between 18,000 and 20,000 head, of which <em>ca</em> 2,000 occurred in Georgia (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). The latest data suggest that there are no fewer than 3,000 animals in Georgia (Kopaliani and Gurielidze 2009; Georgian Biodiversity Database 2013, Ilia State University 2014). In Azerbaijan, in mid-1940s about 2,000 Tur had been harvested annually (Vereshchagin 1947) and if these data are accurate, at least 20,000 animals should have inhabited the country at that time. There was a decline since then. In 2006-2007, 5,300 Tur have been counted on the southern slope, and 1,000 more could occur on the northern slope (Guliyev, Weinberg and Askerov 2009). Since then, an overall census has not been carried out in Azerbaijan, but results of surveys conducted in summer 2013 came up with estimates of more than 13,000 animals (Yarovenko and Weinberg 2013), which might be too optimistic. Final assessment for nowadays could be the following: total population in Azerbaijan hardly exceeds 10,000, more likely it is about 7,000-8,000 animals. Of these, less than 2,000 occurred in Zakatala and about 1,300 in Ilisu Nature Reserves in 2018 (A. Muradov, pers. comm). Magomedov e<em>t al</em>. (2001) suggested that there were up to 20,000 Tur in Daghestan alone, but this may be too optimistic, and later estimates are 15,000 tur (Babaev<em> et al. </em>2017). In Russia, besides Daghestan, there are up to 4,000 tur in North Ossetia, including about 1,000 Tur in North-Ossetian Nature Reserve (Weinberg 2018), about 8,000 animals in Kabardino-Balkaria (Akkiev 2018). Even though, the taxonomic status of this latter population remains unclear and maybe just a half of this number belongs to <em>C. cylindricornis</em> inhabiting the Kabardino-Balkarian Highland Nature Reserve, the rest being hybrid (see Weinberg, Akkiev and Buchukuri 2010). At least some 2,000 Eastern Tur occur in Chechnya and Ingushetia. Currently, Eastern Tur numbers definitely grew since the beginning of 2000s in the Central Caucasus, after local conflicts stopped and political and social situation stabilized in the countries involved, and the total numbers are about 31,000–32,000 animals now.</p>",Stable,"<p>This species is endemic to the central and eastern part of the Great Caucasus along the borders of Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan between 800 and 4,000 m a.s.l. Its range on the north slope begins around the headwaters of the Baksan river east of Mount Elbrus (about 43º10’N, 42º30’E), or slightly more eastwards, at the headwaters of Bezengi river (43º03’N, 43º01’E) (Weinberg, Akkiev and Buchukuri 2010), which approximately corresponds to the headwaters of Inguri river on the south slope in Georgia, and stretches for some 500 km eastwards along both slopes of the Greater Caucasus up to eastern offshoots of Gyumyushlyu mountain of Babadagh mountain massif (40º57’N, 48º29’E). The range is much wider on the northern slope than on the southern slope due the peculiarities of topography. It is more or less continuous with separate locations mainly in the easternmost part of the range in Azerbaijan. Possible geographic barriers are major river valleys cutting across the range and hampering gene flow, like Ardon river valley in the narrowest part of the range in North Ossetia (42º45’N, 43º59’E), or Terek river valley in North Ossetia and Georgia (42º38’N, 44º38’E), and depressions between separate mountain massifs in Azerbaijan. The distribution is widest (up to 60 km) in Daghestan (Magomedov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001) because of the Caucasus Side Range being widest there, while being most narrow in North Ossetia (<em>ca</em> 12 km) (Weinberg 2002c). </p>",<p>This species is hunted for food by local human communities.<br/></p>,Terrestrial,"<p>It is included in Category III in the Georgian Red List (Decree 2014) and thus legally protected there.

Other protected areas with this species include Alania National Park (Russia), Tushetian and Kazbegi Strict Nature Reserves (Georgia), and Ilisu Nature Reserve with Kakh Sanctuary and Ismailly Nature Reserve together with a sanctuary of the same name, and the newly founded Shakhdagh National Park (Azerbaijan).

Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey <em>et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014).

97218336,3787,Capra falconeri,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-09-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is assessed as Near Threatened: it nearly qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion C2a(i) as there are less than 10,000 mature individuals (estimated 5,808, based on our analysis of data from 2011-2013) and each subpopulation, except one, has less than 1,000 mature individuals. The largest subpopulation had an estimated 1,697 mature individuals in 2011. There is no observed, estimated, projected or inferred continuing decline of the total population. However, stable and increasing subpopulations are restricted to areas with sustainable hunting management and protected areas. Were these conservation activities to cease in the future, poaching would likely increase, possibly changing positive trajectories in these areas downward, and the species would then qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The previous (2008) assessment of Endangered appears erroneous. The data available would have qualified the taxon for the category Vulnerable based on criterion C with &lt;10,000 mature individuals, because the most recent estimates cited by Valdez (2008) ranged from 5,080 to 5,630 (mean 5,355) individuals, of which 60% or 3,213 would have been mature animals. Further, there had been an inferred continuous decline (C1), and in the largest subpopulation in the Torghar Hills there were an estimated 1,600 individuals, of which 960 (60%) would be assumed to be mature, just meeting the threshold of criterion C2a(i) for the category Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The reason for the change from category Vulnerable (the corrected 2008 assessment) to Near Threatened is Genuine (recent, since assessments 1994, 1996 and 2008). Available data show that the earlier population decline had ceased for more than five years due to effective conservation measures. This has led to the stabilization of key subpopulations and increase in parts of the species range. Since 2002, the largest subpopulation has been estimated at &gt;1,000 mature individuals for a number of years. Thus, criteria C1 and C2a(i) for Vulnerable have not been met for five or more years.</p>","<em>Capra falconeri</em> is adapted to mountainous terrain with steep cliffs, between 600 and 3,600 m elevation. The species is typically found in areas with open woodlands, scrublands and light forests. In Pakistan and India these are made up primarily of oaks (e.g. <em>Quercus ilex</em>), pines (e.g. <em>Pinus gerardiana</em>), junipers (e.g. <em>Juniperus macropoda</em>) and Deodar Cedar (<em>Cedrus deodora</em>) as well as spruce (<em>Picea smithiana</em>) and fir (<em>Abies spectabilis, A. pindrow</em>) in certain areas. In Tajikistan the vegetation in the lower parts consists of open woodland and shrub communities with Pistachio (<em>Pistacia vera</em>), Redbud (<em>Cercis griffithii</em>) and Almond (<em>Amygdalus bucharica</em>); with increasing elevation juniper trees (<em>Juniperus seravschanica</em>), (<em>J. semiglobosa</em>), mixed with shrubs of maple (<em>Acer regelii</em>, <em>A. turkestanicum</em>), rose (<em>Rosa kokanica</em>), honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera nummulariifolia</em>) and <em>Cotoneaster spp.</em>. Markhor rarely use the high mountain zone above the tree line. Markhor are diurnal, but most active in the early morning and late afternoon. They alternate seasonally between grazing (summer) and browsing (winter), eating grasses and leaves. Females gestate for 135-170 days and give birth typically to 1-2 kids. The animals are sexually mature at 18-30 months, and live up to 12-13 years. Predators include Wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Snow Leopard (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>) and on kids Golden Eagle (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>). <em></em>","<em></em><em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></strong></em><br/>Within Afghanistan, Markhor have traditionally been hunted in Nuristan and Laghman, and this may have intensified during the Afghan wars since 1979. According to surveys by WCS in Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008), Markhor continue to be the most important game for local hunters (despite a nominal nationwide ban on hunting). Petocz and Larsson (1977) wrote that rangelands and forests were likely capable of supporting a higher Markhor population than that observed. They assumed that impact of livestock grazing on habitat conditions was limited because the number of domestic animals was restricted by the area's capacity to produce and store winter fodder, as heavy snowfall prevents winter grazing. Recent numbers of livestock are unknown for Nuristan, but recent increases associated with an expanding human population may create competition for forage (WCS 2008). According to a study using recent satellite imagery (Delattre and Rahmani 2007) no large-scale deforestation of the coniferous forests was observed in Markhor habitat in Afghanistan. However, the extent of deforestation for the last five years in a region affected by war and largely out of state control is unknown.<p><br/>In India, all Markhor populations are small (usually &lt; 50) and fragmented. The largest population, in Kajinag, may have potential for long-term survival if immediate conservation measures can be implemented. Key threats to the Markhor’s range are insurgency-related effects, intensified local resource use, poaching, and large-scale development. Poaching by professional hunters may have been the primary cause of decimation of Markhor in the past, but communal hunting during winter was practised until recently. Armed conflicts may have increased poaching by both the military and militants, while poaching by local people may have declined due to confiscation of arms and restriction on human movements. Other pressures come from habitat encroachment by camps of Gujjars and the armed forces, excessive livestock grazing by local and nomadic Bakkarwal herders in parts of the range, and collection of timber and other forest products. Large scale development includes the proposed Mughal road connecting the state capital Srinagar with Rajouri, which passes through the Hirpura Wildlife Sanctuary, and limestone and gypsum mining around Limbar and Lacchipora Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Indian Government has fenced the entire Line of Control with multi-layered barbed wire. This may have caused further fragmentation of populations of Markhor (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, control of poaching in Chitral Gol National Park and in several community-based conservancies has been successful. There, the population is stable or increasing. However, many subpopulations of Flare-horned Markhor are still small (&lt; 100) and the level of connectivity between them is unknown. The major threat outside established conservancies is poaching.&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri heptneri<br/><br/></em></strong>In Afghanistan, interviews suggested that within Markhor range overhunting is a considerable problem, with little capacity for enforcement of the national hunting ban (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012). As a result, Markhor appear to be under threat due to unsustainable hunting. (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012) Poaching in adjacent areas of Tajikistan is reported to threaten the source population of Markhor in Shahr-e Buzurg District (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, Michel <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Markhor are poached for meat. There are published reports of skins and horns of about 100 poached Markhor being detected in a camp of Afghan poachers in Tajikistan (Michel 2010). According to Moheb and Mostafawi (2011), hunters in northern Shahr-e Buzurg in Afghanistan told numerous stories of groups of hunters going to Tajikistan to poach, and they showed horns and two skins said to originate from there. Because of remoteness, logistical hurdles and lack of security, the international border in this area remains difficult to control.&#160; Cross-border poaching affects the security situation for game wardens, researchers, tourists, and legal foreign hunters and thus jeopardizes the conservation of Markhor in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. A recent report (Alidodov <em>et al.</em> 2014) suggests that in some areas poaching is mainly targeted at mature males (including illegal trophy hunting, Vaisman <em>et al. </em>2014), and that there is a low proportion of adult males (4-5% of the total number, compared to above 20% in other areas). Habitat quality has deteriorated in some locations due to excessive and poorly regulated fuel wood cutting and intensive grazing.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, increasing grazing of goats and intense poaching threaten Markhor (Lukarevski 2002), whereas Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997b) reported that in 1995 grazing and illegal hunting seemed well controlled in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Markhor are now largely restricted to the Surkhan State Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. Despite their protected status, illegal cutting of trees and shrubs, livestock grazing, and poaching were reported (UNDP 2007). No specific information on the current status of these threats is available, but recent Markhor population data (Xoliqov 2013) suggest that the threats are controlled, at least to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros<br/><br/></em></strong>Valdez (2008) reported that in Afghanistan excessive hunting by local people and forage competition with livestock were pushing Markhor to the periphery of its range. Such severe pressure was leading the population to a slow demise, and its status is unlikely to have improved since.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most important threat to subpopulations outside the Torghar Conservancy is illegal hunting. Other threats include competition with livestock, risk of disease transmission from livestock (Woodford <em>et al.</em> 2004), habitat degradation, and habitat loss (Sheikh and Molur 2004). According to Hess <em>et al. </em>(1997), significant habitat loss was caused by logging in the Sulaiman Range, which they considered the most important area of straight-horned Markhor’s distribution. No recent data on the Markhor in the Sulaiman range are available and recent satellite images from 2011 and 2013 (Google Earth, accessed 2014) suggest that habitat conditions in the Sulaiman range are still largely suitable for Markhor.<br/><br/>Another threat for all Markhor subspecies may be posed by the spillover of contagious diseases from domestic goats and other livestock sharing Markhor habitat. Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a contagious, lethal disease to caprids, perhaps overlooked for long time in the north of Pakistan, was recently confirmed to be present in domestic goats in Gilgit-Baltistan and south-western Tajikistan (Peyraud <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Mycoplasma capricolum</em> subsp. <em>capricolum</em>, an infectious bacterium hosted by domestic goats, killed at least 64 Markhor in fall 2010 in one area in Tajikistan (Ostrowski<em> et al</em>. 2011). In India diseases such as foot and mouth disease are reportedly common in livestock and can infect Markhor (Ranjitsinh<em> et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>Hybridization with domestic goats may be a potential threat for all subspecies as goats commonly graze in Markhor habitats. Hammer <em>et al.</em> (2008) found introgressive hybridization with domestic goat among 35.7% of Markhor from three zoos, and speculated that in some cases introgressed wild living ancestral <em>C. falconeri</em> herds may have been the source populations of captive Markhor.</p>  <em></em>","The criteria for Red List Categories refer to mature individuals, but most available population data present total numbers. Here we referred to these total numbers; and for the assessment we assumed that 60% of each population estimate were mature individuals, defined as “the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of Markhor, this definition excludes kids and yearlings.<br/><br/>The most recent data for most of the species’ range are from different time periods (2008–2014) and of variable quality, including information based on observations, estimates and educated guesses. Data from 2011-2013 are available for most areas, suggesting a total of about 8,800 Markhor. This number does not include some areas for which no data are available for that period. Based on older data and trends we assumed that in total approximately 900 Markhor existed in those areas, for a global population of about 9,700. We therefore assess the global population to be more than 5,800 mature individuals.<br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></em></strong><br/>In Afghanistan, during a survey in April 1972, 37 Markhor were counted in the upper Alingar Valley, and numerous signs of presence and reports by local hunters were documented there and in the upper Alishang Valley, suggesting a viable population (Petocz 1972). In south central Nuristan Petocz and Larsson (1977) recorded 350 Markhor, but considered this number a small proportion of the local population. The observed sex-age structure indicated high reproduction and possibly a fairly stable population size or moderate decline despite hunting pressure. In contrast, in eastern Nuristan Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1977) found a dramatic decline caused by hunting. Camera surveys, hunter interviews, and participatory distribution mapping conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in south central Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggested that the species was still present in the area surveyed by Petocz and Larsson (1977) and that the occupied range area was still largely the same. Although a 370 km transect survey by the WCS team recorded only three individuals, information obtained from local hunters and the importance of the species as main object of hunting indicated a population at least in the range of up to a few hundred animals.<br/><br/>In India, a survey of the species October 2004 to April 2005 in the Hirpura and Kajinag areas of the Pir Panjal Mountains in Jammu and Kashmir, recorded 35 Markhor groups, comprising 155 individuals (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005). This count, as well as interviews with key local informants, indicated that 350–375 Markhor may have existed in the surveyed area of Jammu and Kashmir. This is slightly higher than earlier numbers of 200–300 (Schaller 1977, Fox and Johnsingh 1997), probably because earlier reports were incomplete guesses based on information from only parts of the Kashmir Valley. The taxon’s range had contracted from about 300 km² in the late 1940s to about 120 km² in 2004–2005. (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009)<br/><br/>For Pakistan, population numbers are available for various time periods and for different locations. Areas were surveyed during different seasons. The numbers we present are based on differing methods (counts, estimates, guesses), and names, locations and borders of specific sites are not always clearly defined. Most recent numbers are available for 2011 and 2012, suggesting a total number of about 4,500 Flare-horned Markhor. More than 1,500 occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan (WCS 2012), 2,959 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Iftikhar Uz Zaman pers. comm. 2014); and Arshad (2011) believed that in Azad Jammu and Kashmir approximately 50 Markhor existed. If these figures are correct, they indicate a substantial increase from the previous Red List assessment (Valdez 2008), when less than 2,500 to 3,000 Flare-horned Markhor were assumed to survive in Pakistan. Approximately 21 years before the current assessment (or about three generations), there were thought to be in total about 2,075-2,575 Flare-horned Markhor, including 1,075 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP 1992) and 1,000-1,500 in Gilgit-Baltistan (NA Forest Department unpubl. information 1993, reported in Valdez 2008). Thus numbers in Gilgit-Baltistan may have remained stable or increased, while the population in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa appears to have increased substantially.<br/><br/>Schaller and Khan (1975) assumed a total of at least 5,250 Flare-horned Markhor living in Pakistan and in India. Petocz (1972) and Petocz and Larsson (1977) counted 387 animals in Afghanistan. The total population number of the subspecies at this time was thus about 5,650 Markhor (about 3,380 mature individuals). Available data suggest that during the period 1985-1993, the total number for the subspecies might have been around 2,950 (1,770 mature individuals). Arshad (2011) assessed the total population number for “Kashmir” Markhor alone at 1,800–2,000 individuals. An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that as of 2012, the total population of <em>C. f. falconeri</em> was close to 5,000 (i.e., about 3,000 mature individuals). Hence the total population of this subspecies apparently decreased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, but since then it appears to have recovered.<br/><br/>Data for specific locations in Pakistan show varying trends of population numbers:<ul><li>In 1970, the Chitral Gol, a valley of 77.5 km² in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly NWFP), and at that time the private hunting reserve of the Mehtar of Chitral, was estimated to harbour 100 to 125 animals (Schaller and Mirza 1971). In 1984, this area was declared a National Park, and by 1985-86, it contained 160 (recorded) to 300 (estimated) animals. In addition, the proportion of males &gt; 4.5 years in the population increased during the same period (Hess 1986). Within this time span, Aleem (1979) recorded a maximum of 520 animals in Chitral Gol in 1979. The increase was attributed to better protection from poaching and to other improvement efforts in the Park (Malik 1985). However, according to Ahmad (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008), the population in Chitral Gol National Park was reduced to 195 Markhor in 1987. Estimates by Arshad (2011) showed an increase to 373 in 2003 and 590 in 2005/2006. Ali (2008) confirmed the positive trend leading to 612 Markhor recorded in 2006 with a computed annual growth rate of 7.7%. I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population in Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division (including Chitral Gol National Park and its buffer zone, Arshad pers. inf. 2014) from 1,146 in 2009 to 1,364 Markhor in 2012, a greater rate of growth than that suggested by a projection of the data presented by Ali (2008). The precision of these estimates cannot be assessed, as some earlier counts may have been biased low, and the area covered during different surveys might have changed and be thus not directly comparable. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest a substantial increase in the Chitral Gol National Park and adjacent areas.</li><li>For the Tushi Game Reserve (GR) in the Chitral District, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 125 animals, similar to the estimate in 1985-86 (anonymous 1986, Hess in press, quoted in Valdez 2008). In the Tushi Shasha Conservancy, Ali (2008) observed 137 Markhor in 1990 and 545 in 2006, from which he calculated an annual population growth of 7.9%. For the entire Chitral Wildlife Division (without Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division) I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population from 1,049 in 2009 to 1,456 Markhor in 2012.</li><li>The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) estimated 221 Markhor in Kohistan and 58 in Swat of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. According to I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) numbers recorded in Kohistan from 2009 to 2012 varied between 128 and 233, whereas recorded numbers in Swat decreased from 110 in 2010 to 11 in 2012.</li><li>The population of Markhor in the Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary (Gilgit District of Gilgit-Baltistan Province) was estimated by Roberts (1969) as not less than 500 to 600 animals; by Schaller and Khan (1975) as 50; by Rasool (no date, probably 1976, quoted in Valdez 2008) as 109; by Hess (1986) as 50 to 75; and by Rasool (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008) in 1991 as 40-50. In 2012 this population had reportedly recovered to 300 animals (WCS 2012).</li></ul><br/><br/><em>Capra falconeri heptneri</em><br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong>WCS staff surveyed parts of the potential range of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> in Northern Afghanistan in 2011. Due to security problems these surveys covered only small areas. The team observed four Markhor between Payan-e Moor and Aspakha Villages in the Kohe Ghaws area of Shahr-e Buzurg in Takhar Province. Local hunters believed that there were perhaps 20 Markhor left in this area. The interviews in Shahr-e Buzurg strongly supported the historical presence of Markhor in this district: 41 informants from northern and central Shahr-e Buzurg believed that Markhor were abundant in northern Shahr-e Buzurg during the 1970s. In the area between Dahan-e Ab Kof and Leiwgard Village in the Gandamargh Valley (Kuf Ab District in Darwaz, Badakhshan Province), the team observed six Markhor. Interviews with local hunters suggested that this area held approximately 80 Markhor (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>In the ex-Soviet republics, the total population was estimated to be about 1,000–1,200 animals in the 1970s (Zhirnov 1977), generally decreasing in the 1990s to about 700 animals (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997a). However, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997b), based on reports from game wardens and local inhabitants, believed the local population in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Turkmenistan increased during the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>Between 1960 and 1970, Zhirnov (1977) assumed that there were approximately 1,000 Markhor in Tajikistan, with the only viable population in the Kushvariston and Hazratishoh Mountains. In contrast, Sokov (1983, quoted in Baskin and Danell 2003) assumed that in 1967 only 500 remained in Tajikistan, decreasing to 400 by 1983. During the late 1980s in the Hazratishoh Range and in Kushvariston (Tajikistan) there were around 350 Markhor (Sokov 1989). Survey data from 2008-2012 (Michel et al. 2014) indicated that the subpopulation in the Hazratishoh and Darvaz Ranges of Tajikistan was stable and likely increasing, with a total of 1,018 recorded in 2012. A survey in 2014 recorded 1,300 in these areas (Alidodov <em>et al</em>. 2014) In the Sarsarak Range a separate population was rediscovered in 2014, with eight Markhor counted and about 30–40 reported by local hunters (K. Karimov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>During surveys on the western (Turkmenistan) slopes of the Kugitang Range in 1995 and 2000, Weinberg et al. (1997b) and Lukarveski (2002) recorded 227 and 303 Markhor respectively. No recent information from Turkmenistan is available on the population number and trend of this subpopulation. Given the stable or slightly increasing numbers at the eastern (Uzbekistan) slope of the Kugitang Range, we assume that in Turkmenistan currently there are about 250 Markhor.<br/><br/>In the early 1980s there were 400 Markhor in Uzbekistan according to the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1983), but in 1994 there were only 270-290 estimated in Uzbekistan, with only 86 counted in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (western slope of Kugitang Range) in May 1993 (Chernogaev et al. 1995). Survey data by the administration of Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve suggested an increase since a low in 2003 (140-150 recorded, 160–180 guessed), reaching its maximum at 310–313 animals in 2013 (Xoliqov 2013).<br/><br/>An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that the recent (2011-2013) total population of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> was about 1,680 Markhor (1,008 mature individuals).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros</em></strong><br/><br/>In Afghanistan, few animals survived even in the late 1990s, perhaps 50-80 in the Kohe Safi region, with a few in other isolated pockets (Valdez 2008). No recent information is available on the population numbers of Straight-horned Markhor in Afghanistan. The subspecies may be extirpated in the country, but potentially Markhor from Pakistan (e.g., Torghar hills) may cross into Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, population numbers for Straight-horned Markhor are well documented for the Torghar Hills (Baluchistan). Roberts (1969) believed that the main concentration of the Straight-horned Markhor was in the Toba Kakar and Torghar hills and numbers could have been less than 500. In 1984, Tareen estimated that fewer than 200 Markhor remained in the Torghar Hills (Mitchell 1989, quoted in USFWS 2012). The estimate by Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) of 1,684 for 1999 represents a substantial increase compared to Johnson (1997) who estimated there were 695 Sulaiman Markhor in the Torghar Hills in 1994. Rosser et al. (2005) summarized results from surveys that suggested Markhor in the Torghar Hills had increased to over 1,600 by the year 2000. Arshad and Khan (2009) presented an estimate of 3,158 Markhor in Torghar in 2008. M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) considered this estimate possibly biased, and based on a new, conservative analysis of these data, suggested revising this estimate to 1,729. The most recent population estimate of 2,829 in 2011 is from M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There is no recent estimate for Straight-horned Markhor in other areas in Pakistan, but we assume there to be about 200 <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in other areas of Baluchistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 150 Straight-horned Markhor in the Takatu hills in 1971, but later Ahmad (1989) reported that only 50 still existed in these hills, and only 100 in the area of Koh-i-Sulaiman. In the Ziarat Mountains in Balochistan, Qadir Shah <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded nine and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) counted 32 Straight-horned Markhor. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) gave a total of only 24 animals for the whole province: 12 for the Mardan area, and 12 for the Sheikh Buddin National Park.<br/><br/>Although an accurate estimate of the total number of this subspecies is not possible, it can be assumed that with the population in the Torghar Hills estimated at 2,829 in 2011 (M. Frisina pers. comm. 2014) the total number might be slightly above 3,000 animals. In the 1990s this total was assumed to be around 870 (Ahmad 1989, NWFP 1992, Johnson 1997 quoted in Frisina and Tareeen 2009, Valdez 2008). Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated that more than 2,000 individuals remained throughout the entire range of Straight-horned Markhor in Pakistan. Roberts (1969) estimated that the total population of the former subspecies <em>C. f. jerdoni</em>, restricted mainly to the Province of Baluchistan, may have exceeded 1,000 animals, but that it was severely threatened because it survived in discontinuous and isolated pockets. For this same area, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated fewer than 1,000 animals. Thus, over the past 20 years, numbers have recovered substantially, but this is known only for one area, the Torghar Hills.",Increasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, northern India (southwest Jammu and Kashmir), northern and central Pakistan, southern Tajikistan, southwestern Turkmenistan, and southern Uzbekistan (Grubb 2005). <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri</strong><br/><br/></em>Afghanistan: historically occurred in the eastern portion of the country, in the high mountainous, monsoon forests of Laghman (headwaters of Alingar and Alishang Rivers); Kunar and Nuristan (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1972, Petocz and Larsson 1977) and is still extant at least in south central Nuristan (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>India: restricted to part of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009). Populations are scattered throughout this range, starting from just east of the Banihal pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009 observed Markhor only in Kajinag and Hirpura, and confirmed evidence of their occurrence in Boniyar and Poonch. In the areas of Shamsabari and Banihal Pass the taxon is likely extinct.<br/><br/>Pakistan: a&#160;detailed study on the past and present distribution of “Kashmir” Markhor by Arshad (2011) showed that the area of occupancy and the number of locations have declined greatly (approx. 70%) during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, historic ranges larger than present ranges are partly a result of too much generalization in the older distribution maps, which include large sections of unsuitable habitat. It is not clear to what extent exchange takes place between the often small groups of Markhor inhabiting different watersheds. Flare-horned Markhor are mainly confined to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the valleys of the Kunar (Chitral) river and its tributaries. According to Schaller and Khan (1975), along the Indus River, Markhor inhabited both banks from Jalkot (District Kohistan) upstream to near the Tungas village (District Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit on the Gilgit River, Chalt and (Haraspo) Sikandarabad on the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley on the Astor River. Currently, Markhor are known from various locations in the Diamer, Astor, Gilgit and Baltistan Districts.&#160;Markhor are&#160;found along the Nagar Hunza River from Sikandarabad downstream, in Naltar Valley, along the Gilgit River downstream from Singul and along the Indus River downstream from Basho to the provincial border with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). Markhor are known to be present in the Juglot Ghooro, Rahimabad and Haramosh valleys in Central Karakoram National Park (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, Ecologist, Central Karakoram National Park, pers. comm. 2014). The population in Haramosh was considered extinct by Arshad (2011), but since winter 2011 Markhor have been observed there (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, pers. comm. 2014), possibly indicating natural recolonization. The distribution range in Gilgit-Baltistan has been updated based on information from various sources (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Flare-horned Markhor were found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan where it inhabited valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River (Schaller and Khan 1975). The distribution range in Chitral has been updated based on Arshad (2011), and includes side valleys of the Indus River upstream from Dubair, the Shishi River Valley as well as the Chitral River Valley and its tributaries upstream from Chitral up to Kaghozi Gol (Mastuj River Valley) and Shogore (Lutkho River Valley).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri heptneri</strong><br/><br/></em>This subspecies previously occupied most of the mountains lying along the banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan. Currently, it is found in only two or three scattered populations&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">and its distribution has been greatly reduced&#160;(Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). The subspecies was confirmed to occur as well in Afghanistan on the bank of the Pyanj River (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Afghanistan: almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution before 1979 (Habibi 1977). Reconnaissance surveys and interviews with villagers have shown that, across from the two strongholds of Markhor in Tajikistan, this subspecies exists but in very low numbers in the Darwaz Region (Kof Ab district, ~ 38°02’ N, 70°23’ E) of Badakhshan Province, and in Shahr-e Buzurg District and neighboring Chah Ab District of Takhar Province (~ 37°31’ N, 70°02’ E). The Markhor seem to cross the Pyanj River (which forms the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Tajikistan: limited to the region along the Pyanj River east of Kulyab, southern Hazratishoh range (~ 70°05' E and 37°54' N), including the Kushvariston massif (~ 70°03' E, 37°35' N) and the Pasi Parvor mountains (~ 70°16' E, 37°44' N), and the eastern slope of the southwestern edge of the Darvaz range (~ 70°21' E, 38°05' N, Shuroabad&#160; district of Khatlon Region and Darvaz district of GBAO Region). Formerly markhor were reported from the Babatag Mountains (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Uzbekistan (Ishunin 1972) and from the Sanglak and Sarsarak Ranges (southern parts of the Vakhsh Range, ~ 69°7' E, 38°13' N) (Abdusalyamov 1988). No recent reliable information suggests that Markhor still exist in the Babatag (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). The presence of Markhor in the Sarsarak Range was confirmed in 2014, but the species has been extirpated from the Sanglak Mountains (Khalil Karimov, Panthera, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Uzbekistan: found in the Kugitang Range (~ 66°36' E, 37°48' N) at the border with Turkmenistan. Its occurrence was reported in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from the Babatag Range (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Tajikistan (Bogdanov 1992).<br/><br/>Turkmenistan: restricted to the western slope of the Kugitang Range (~ 66°31' E, 37°49' N), bordering Uzbekistan (~66°40’ E, 37°30’ N; Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997a).&#160;<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri megaceros</strong><br/><br/></em>In Afghanistan, at least until 1978, this subspecies survived in the Kabul Gorge (Kabul Province) and the Kohe Safi area of Parwan Province, and possibly in some isolated pockets of Paktia Province. Intensive hunting pressure had forced it into the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range (Petocz <em>et al.</em> 1977, Valdez, 2008). No recent information is available on whether or not the subspecies is still extant in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most comprehensive study of the distribution and status of the Straight-horned Markhor was published by Schaller and Khan (1975). The study showed a huge past range for this subspecies, but the actual range in Pakistan at that time consisted only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan Province, a small area in the former Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and one unconfirmed occurrence in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). Virk (1991) summarized the information for Baluchistan Province, and confirmed the subspecies’ presence in the area of the Koh-i-Sulaiman (Zhob District) and the Takatu hills (Quetta District), both according to Ahmad (1989). The presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Torghar hills of the Toba Kakar range (Zhob District) has been repeatedly confirmed and it is possible that currently this area holds the only population consisting of more than 100 individuals of this subspecies (Tareen 1990, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Arshad and Khan 2009). Qadir Shah <em>et al. </em>(2010) and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) confirmed the presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Ziarat Mountains in Ziarat District of Baluchistan Province. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1987, 1992) considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. There is no recent information about the Safed Koh range (Kurram and Khyber Districts) where, according to Schaller and Khan (1975) probably at least 100 animals lived on the Pakistan side of the border with Afghanistan in the early 1970s.</p>",See Use and Trade details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"<p>All subspecies and populations of <em>Capra falconeri</em> were uplisted from Appendix II to Appendix&#160;I of CITES in 1992. The 10<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES in 1997 passed a resolution (Conf. 10.15) allowing for an annual export quota of six Markhor trophies from Pakistan’s community-based hunting management areas to states parties to CITES. CITES increased the annual export quota to 12 in 2002, to further encourage community-based conservation (Resolution Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP 14)). The EU Scientific Review Group has expressed a positive opinion on the import of Markhor trophies from well-managed conservancies in Tajikistan (EU SRG 2014).<br/><br/>Within Afghanistan, the species was protected nominally in 2004 (WCS 2008) by a nationwide presidential decree banning hunting, but this ban was not generally enforced. In 2009 the species was listed on Afghanistan’s Protected Species List, making any hunting or trade within the country illegal. The species does not occur in any protected areas. Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>identify remaining populations, their distribution and numbers;</li><li>facilitate the development of community-based conservation in areas with extant populations or with potential for immigration of Markhor from neighboring countries and establish conservation incentives;</li><li>raise public awareness about the conservation importance of the country’s Markhor populations and potential benefits from their sustainable use;</li><li>develop trans-boundary collaboration between nature conservation authorities and community based initiatives, including the prevention of cross-border poaching (Petocz 1972; Petocz and Larsson 1977; Valdez 2008; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012; Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urgent measures are required to conserve the straight-horned “Kabul” Markhor <em>C. f. megaceros</em> if still extant. Surveys to assess numbers and distribution are important. Local people’s support for its conservation is essential, but this will be difficult to obtain, as the initiation of community-based hunting management is currently not possible due to the hunting ban and the difficult security situation in the area.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, Markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978 (Ganhar 1979). Currently, Markhor in India occur in only three small protected areas: the Limber Game Reserve, and the Lachipora and Hirapora Wildlife Sanctuaries. Conservation measures proposed include:</p><p></p><ul><li>raise awareness among the army, policy makers and local people about the rarity of the Markhor and the importance of the region for its conservation;</li><li>the largest Markhor population, in Kajinag, merits the establishment of a protected refuge and the state’s Wildlife Department has already initiated a move to set up the Kajinag National Park;</li><li>involve local people, especially nomadic herders and the armed forces, in the conservation of Markhor, including the realigning of grazing practices so that important areas of Markhor habitat are excluded from grazing, and as much as possible mitigating the larger impacts due to fencing and insurgency (Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009);</li><li>consider future re-introductions to previously inhabited ranges in the Pir Panjal mountains.</li></ul><p></p><p>    </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Pakistan, the Markhor is completely protected by federal law (Rao 1986). In 1991, the Federal government imposed a 3-year ban on all big game hunting. This ban officially lapsed in 1993 but practically remained in effect, although it was ignored in the case of community-based trophy hunting programs (Shackleton 2001). The central government has issued permits only where a community-based trophy hunting program has been established; as of 2000, 80% of the permit fees were mandated to go to the community and 20% to provincial authorities in charge of nature conservation (although inter-community and provincial-federal disputes over receipts and permitting have occurred). The program continued through 2013 with trophy price for Markhor increasing from US $ 18,000 to about US $ 80,000-100,000. According to official records, between 1998 and 2008 approximately US $ 830,000 was distributed to communities within the former NWFP from hunter remittances from the 17 Markhor taken during this period (A. Khan unpublished data, NWFP Wildlife Management, 2008). With higher trophy fees during the last years, significantly higher contributions to the local communities have created substantial incentives for the conservation of Markhor in the participating conservancies. However, the small number of permits issued by the government (up to 12 per annum in accordance to the CITES export quota) may prevent an extension of the approach into still unmanaged areas.<br/></span><br/>In Pakistan several protected areas contain Flare-horned Markhor: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Chitral Gol NP, Drosh Gol GR, Gahirat Gol GR, Goleem Gol GR, Goleen Gol GR, Purit Gol- Chinar Gol GR, Tushi GR (NWFP 1992); Swat District: Totalai GR (Zool.

(Rasool, no date); Astor District: Astor WS, Tangir GR (Rasool, no date); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir - Muzaffarabad: Mauji CR, Qazi Nag GR, Hillan CR (Zool. Survey Dept. 1986); Poonch District: Phala GR (Qayyum 1986). Only one protected area is known to contain straight-horned markhor in Pakistan: Sheikh Buddin NP (previously a Wildlife Sanctuary) in Dera Ismail Khan District of NWFP (Zoological Survey Dept. 1987). The status of the subspecies in protected areas in Baluchistan is uncertain. Its occurrence is not confirmed in Chiltan-Hazarganji NP, and there is no reliable information for either Sasnamana or Ziarat Juniper WS’s. There are no reports of markhor in protected areas in Punjab.<br/><br/>The Torghar Conservation Project in Baluchistan has reduced poaching and competition by livestock (Johnson 1997; Frisina and Tareen 2009); the markhor population in this area is reported to have increased steadily since initiation of the program (Rosser <em>et al</em>. 2005, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Frisina, Montana State University, pers. comm. 2014). The TCP is the oldest community-controlled program in Pakistan and has been so successful that tribal groups in other mountain ranges of Baluchistan have expressed interest in setting up similar programs (Frisina and Tareen 2009, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Throughout Diamer, southern Gilgit, and Astore Districts of Gilgit-Baltistan community based conservation programs aimed at Markhor conservation have created over 40 community conservation organizations and 18 registered conservancies, and trained and deployed over 100 community rangers. Markhor are now well-protected and appear to be experiencing a significant recovery (WCS 2012).<br/><br/>Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>treat Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary as a focal area for Markhor and enforce protection measures. Kargah is probably the best place for Markhor in the Gilgit District, and like the Chitral Gol, should be rather easy to control because it is a traditional wildlife sanctuary and is close to Gilgit;</li><li>adopt a similar procedure for the area around Bagheecha in the Indus valley, which is one of the best places in Baltistan for Markhor and also relatively easy to control and to the Haramosh and Sikandarabad valleys (in Hunza-Nagar District) in the region of Central Karakoram National Park;</li><li>develop a conservation and management plans that includes information on the status and distribution of <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in the areas it still inhabits outside the Torghar conservancy; consider the area of Koh-e Sulaiman and the Takatu hills as a focal area for conservation efforts and include participatory management in the tribal areas in this plan;</li><li>retain the hunting ban (with its exception for approved community-based trophy hunts);</li><li>encourage the development of community-based hunting management areas in currently unmanaged areas and buffer zones of national parks, and consider a slight increase of the annual quota to ensure more equitable access to benefits from trophy hunts for all conservancies (with quota set on the basis of monitoring results).</li></ul><p></p>    <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Tajikistan, Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik) with an area of almost 20,000 ha was established in 1973, but since the early 1990s poaching has become common, and the security situation deteriorated due to incursions by Afghans (Michel 2010, Moheb and Mostafawi 2011). Markhor are legally protected, but hunting by foreigners was permitted (at least two Markhor/year) in the early 1990s (Weinberg<em> et al.</em> 1997). For the hunting season 2013-2014 the Government of Tajikistan issued a hunting quota of six Markhor, and five were taken by foreign hunters. Hunts are restricted to conservancies established and managed by local small family businesses and community based non-governmental organizations. About 80% of the Markhor recorded by the recent survey (Alidodov<em> et al. </em>2014) were in these conservancies. All captive Markhor in Dashtijum and Romit Strict Nature Reserves and the introduced animals in Romit were poached during civil unrest during the 1990s. </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Proposed conservation measures include:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>strengthening community-based conservation and management through secure rights and obligations for conservancies, issuing of area-specific hunting quotas based on survey results, issuing of import permits for hunting trophies and sharing of benefits with local communities;</li><li>prevention of assignment of hunting rights to non-locals and business structures and of illegal trophy hunts;</li><li>reducing poaching through trans-boundary collaboration, community-based hunting management and law enforcement;</li><li>reducing the risk of disease transmission from domestic sheep and goats by implementing grazing regulations minimizing direct and indirect transmission risks, monitoring the presence of infectious agents in domestic stock and implementing efficient vaccinations on domestic sheep and goats at least against CCPP and Peste des Petits Ruminant disease;</li><li>preservation of the quality of habitat through regulation of forest use and grazing.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Turkmenistan the species is legally protected. Markhor occur in the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik), established in 1986 and covering about 27,000 ha. Lukarevsky (2002) suggested that ecotourism and trophy hunting may provide incentives for the conservation of Markhor. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested enlarging the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve because it protects only the high elevation summer habitat of Markhor and the currently unprotected lower winter ranges are grazed by livestock. Critical for any consideration of a potential trophy hunting programme would be the full involvement of local community members and a benefit sharing mechanism which would ensure their support.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, trophy hunting of Markhor took place in the 1990s (e.g. two in 1994; Weinberg <em>et al. </em>1997) and until about 2005, including hunting in an enclosure containing a small captive group, which no longer exists (S. Zagrebin pers. comm. 2013). The EU Scientific Review Group in 2006 expressed a negative opinion on the import of Markhor trophies originating from the wild, which led to a suspension of trade in 2007. Markhor in Uzbekistan occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik). With assistance by a UNDP/GEF project during 2008-13 a managed buffer zone was established, encompassing all current Markhor habitat outside the strict nature reserve. Collaboration between the Kugitang (Turkmenistan) and Surkhan Strict Nature Reserves would be of utmost importance for the conservation management of this trans-boundary subpopulation.</p>  <em></em>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

They feed primarily on forb foliage, seeds, flowers, roots, and bulbs plus small amounts of grass foliage and seeds (Dyni and Yensen 1996, Yensen <em>et al</em>. 2018). They are active above-ground for about 4 months per year as individuals and about five months for subpopulations (i.e., from snow melt in late March or April until July or August). Mating occurs soon after spring emergence; males guard sexually receptive females from other males; after mating, females exclude males from the area of their burrows. Gestation lasts about 3.5 weeks; juveniles remain in the burrow until weaned (approximately 3.5 weeks after birth). Litter sizes averaged 5.2 weaned young per litter. There is only one litter per year. Important predators include badgers, prairie falcons, Cooper's hawk, goshawks, red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, coyotes, and long-tailed weasels. They are frequently excluded from more mesic and productive sites by competition with the much larger Columbian ground squirrel but they can occupy less productive sites with shallower soils that will not support Columbian ground squirrels (Yensen and Sherman 1997).","The primary threat to this species&#160;is loss and fragmentation of meadow habitat due to forest encroachment on meadow habitats in the absence of periodic wildfires. The decline of this species has resulted. Other threats include competition with Columbian ground squirrels (which may exclude the Idaho ground squirrel&#160;from deeper soils that provide more favourable conditions for hibernation) (USFWS 2002). Recreational shooting and poisoning of ground squirrels historically were common activities, but recent regulatory changes and educational efforts probably have reduced this threat (USFWS 2004). In most areas, this squirrel faces threats associated with small population size (USFWS 2004). Recreational housing developments in the near future could present a major conservation challenge.","The population declined from an estimated 5,000 individuals in 1985 to 450-500 in 2002 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). The population is currently slowly increasing as a result of habitat treatments. The population was estimated at <em>ca</em>. 2,659 individuals, with less than 1,000 breeding adults, in 2016 (Wagner and Evans Mack 2016). The population is divided into many small subpopulations with &lt;50 individuals and 3-4 subpopulations with &gt;100 individuals (Yensen pers. comm.).

114251609,41687,Ursus americanus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widespread and occupies a large portion of its historical range. The global population is estimated at more than twice that of all other species of bears combined.&#160;Within the United States, populations have been expanding numerically and geographically.&#160;Legal hunting is the primary cause of mortality and is well controlled by state and provincial management agencies in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.&#160;Hunting is banned in Mexico.&#160;Population-level threats exist in only a few isolated places, and relate mainly to habitat fragmentation and conflicts between bears and people. Many management agencies are more concerned with controlling population growth of this species through legal harvest than promoting further growth and geographic expansion (which could increase human–bear conflicts).</p>","<p>American black bears are primarily a species of temperate and boreal forests, but they also range into subtropical areas of Florida and Mexico as well as into the subarctic. They live at elevations ranging from sea level to 3,500 m, and inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican deserts and scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the grizzly bear; Veitch and Harrington 1996).&#160; Between these extremes they occupy assorted deciduous and coniferous forest types, each providing a different array of foods.<br/> <br/> The American black bear is a generalist, opportunist omnivore. Depending on location and season, they consume herbaceous vegetation, roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion.&#160; Moreover, they readily consume various human-related foods, from garbage and birdseed to a variety of agricultural products from cropfields and orchards, including corn, oats, soybeans, sunflowers, wheat, and apples, and brood and honey in apiaries.&#160; Black bear predation upon livestock has also been documented in some areas. The ability of black bears to adjust their diet to the circumstances has enabled them to persist not only in a diversity of habitat types, but also in highly fragmented forested areas in proximity to humans (Pelton 2003, Benson and Chamberlain 2006, Ditmer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> A key habitat feature in many areas is a source of fall mast that enables black bears to increase their fat reserves for winter hibernation.&#160; Historically, American chestnuts (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) likely were a key fall food for bears (and other wildlife) in eastern North America, but after a blight eliminated this food source in the early and mid-1900s, oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.) acorns and beechnuts (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) have become the principal fall foods for bears throughout this region (Vaughan 2002).&#160; However, oaks are now declining in eastern North America due to forestry practices, insects, disease, and over-abundance of deer (McShea <em>et al. </em>2007), and a disease accidentally introduced in the late 1800s is now spreading widely across beech forests in northeastern U.S. (Morin <em>et al. </em>2007). In parts of the range where oaks and beech are absent or uncommon, hazelnuts (<em>Corylus</em> spp.), whitebark pine nuts (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>), saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) berries, madrone (<em>Arbutus xalapensis</em>), manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos</em> spp.), huckleberries (<em>Vaccinium </em>spp.), buffaloberries (<em>Shepherdia canadensis</em>), wild cherries (<em>Prunus </em>sp.), mountain ash (<em>Sorbus </em>spp.), or other fruits, or sometimes meat, are the fall dietary mainstays.&#160; In the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, succulents such as yucca (<em>Yucca</em> spp.) and cactus fruits also play important roles in providing food, especially during drought (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160; American black bears may migrate considerable distances (up to 200 km) to find more abundant food sources, especially in late summer and fall, prior to hibernation (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Beck 1991, Hellgren <em>et al. </em>2005, Noyce and Garshelis 2011).<br/> <br/> American black bears hibernate for up to 7 months in the northern portions of their range (Bertram and Vivion 2002, Chaulk <em>et al. </em>2005), but for considerably shorter periods in more southerly areas (Wooding and Hardisky 1992, Waller <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; In some southern and low-elevation areas, where food is available year-round, some bears may remain active during winter (Hellgren and Vaughan 1987, Graber 1990, Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Hightower <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; However, all parturient females den to give birth to cubs, typically in January–February.&#160; American black bears use a wide variety of den structures: existing caves or tree cavities, underground chambers that they excavate, root masses, brush piles, or even above-ground nests. Adequate denning sites or structures are rarely thought to be limiting, except in habitats that flood (because young cubs may drown or die of exposure; White <em>et al.</em> 2001), or where bears preferentially choose certain types of dens, such as hollow trees, that are being reduced through logging (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Mating typically occurs in May–July, but may be extended in southern latitudes (Garshelis and Hellgren 1994, Spady <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Females can have as many as 3 estrous cycles (B. Durrant, personal communication, 2014). Implantation is delayed, and active gestation is only 2 months.&#160; Females give birth beginning at age 3–10 years: their rate of growth and maturity varies with food availability, and hence tends to be especially delayed in northern boreal forests.&#160; They can produce cubs every other year, but in places with less food, this interval may be extended to 3 years.&#160; Average litter size is approximately 2.5 cubs in eastern (ranging up to 5 or rarely 6 cubs) versus &lt;2.0 cubs in western North America (Alt 1989, Garshelis 1994, Bridges <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160; Reproductive rate in this species is highest among the ursids, although there is a clear dichotomy between Eastern (including Midwestern) and Western populations.</p>","<p>Throughout most of its range, this species is not threatened.&#160;Legal sport hunting is well controlled by state and provincial agencies to fit management objectives, and most states and provinces that harvest bears have a management plan (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;American black bears are harvested as a game species in all 12 Canadian provinces and territories where they exist and in 31 U.S. states.&#160;Since the early 2000s, 6 states with increasing bear populations opened bear hunting seasons ― Florida, New Jersey and Maryland, after 21-, 33- and 51-year closures, respectively, and Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Nevada for the first time in their management history. The sport harvest for this species in Canada and the U.S. totals 40,000–50,000 annually.&#160;Currently, black bears are not legally hunted in Mexico, but some conditional permits are allowed for depredation cases.<br/> <br/> A few small, isolated populations of American black bears may be threatened with extirpation, simply due to small population size, effects of fluctuating food (and in some cases water) resources, or direct human-caused mortality.&#160;A very small (&lt;20 black bears), isolated population in western Florida may persist only if tenuous travel corridors to other, more robust populations are made safer for bears (Larkin <em>et al. </em>2004). An isolated population on a peninsula in Ontario was judged to have a high probability of extirpation unless all non-natural mortality was eliminated (Howe <em>et al. </em>2007). A black bear population on a large island in Québec was extirpated apparently from introduced deer excessively browsing berry-producing shrubs, and thus eliminating an essential food supply for the resident bears (Côté 2005).<br/> <br/> Most small, isolated populations are in the southern U.S. In a particularly dramatic case, a severe drought in 2000 prompted a number of bears from Big Bend National Park, an isolated population in southwestern Texas, to travel to Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, apparently in search of better fall mast — most never returned (they either remained in Mexico, died naturally when crossing the desert, or were killed by people).&#160;As a result, the entire Big Bend population was reduced to 5–7 bears, including only 2 adult females (Hellgren et al. 2005).&#160;However, since that time, this population has rebounded to higher numbers than were there before the exodus in 2000, likely supplemented by bears immigrating from Mexico. Mexico served as the original source of the recolonization of bears in southwest Texas after they had been eradicated during the 1940s (Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Movements by bears across the seemingly harsh, xeric environment of southwestern U.S. and Mexico once appeared to be anomalous (Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Onorato <em>et al. </em>2004), but it is now recognized as an integral part of the ecology of bears in this region.&#160; In 2011, northern Mexico experienced record drought and wildfires that not only caused high direct bear mortality, but also prompted immigration of bears of both sexes into unburned, previously unoccupied habitat in both Mexico and Texas.<br/> <br/> Increased public awareness of bears and protection from human-caused mortality are likely enabling bears to successfully traverse areas of Mexico where they once would have been persecuted.&#160; Additionally, reports of bears using deer feeders on game ranches in northern Mexico and south Texas have become commonplace, and may be playing a role in promoting bear movements and population growth.&#160; Conversely, recently constructed barriers and human activity spurred by illegal human immigration and drug-related violence could thwart the natural interchange of bears across the U.S.–Mexican border (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/> <br/> Conflicts with humans have been a threat to black bears since European colonization of North America (Cardoza 1976). Human–bear conflict stems from humans and bears competing for space and bears being attracted to food items produced or managed by people. Due to their generalist food habits, black bears are readily attracted to many human sources of foods, such as garbage, agricultural crops, apiaries, and sometimes livestock, especially when their preferred wild foods are scarce. People kill bears in retribution, to prevent property damage, or in fear for their safety.&#160; Encounters between black bears and people have increased as people have encroached upon bear habitat, and as bear populations have increased and expanded into areas occupied by people.&#160; Most states and provinces with a significant population of black bears report common or increasing conflicts between bears and people (Hristienko and McDonald 2007, Spencer <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Recent studies suggest that variation in abundance of natural foods tends to be a key driver of human–bear conflict levels (Howe <em>et al. </em>2010, Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urban areas provide attractive sources of anthropogenic food for bears during periods of natural food shortages, but also are a source of increased mortality (Ryan <em>et al. </em>2007, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014). Urban areas are expected to increase across American black bear range in the future (Bierwagen <em>et al. </em>2010), which, coupled with the potential frequent natural food shortages in arid bear habitats as a result of global climate change, may threaten small or isolated bear populations.<br/> <br/> Increasing density of roads, with increasing traffic volume, is another growing threat to American black bears.&#160; Without immigration from an adjacent national forest, bear numbers in a rural residential community in north-central Florida would have declined as a result of increased adult female mortality from vehicle collisions (Hostetler <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; A stretch of highway in North Carolina that was upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane, with increased speed limits and a new alignment, caused increased bear mortalities that negatively affected the nearby population, even though underpasses were made available (van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012). Poor food years tend to spur wide-scale movements of black bears, resulting in increased mortalities from vehicular collisions (Wooding and Maddrey 1994).</p>","<p>Heavily persecuted since European settlement of North America, compounded by loss of forest cover, American black bear populations rapidly declined, and probably reached a nadir in the early 1900s. Greater state and provincial protection for bears enabled populations to slowly recover.&#160; More rapid growth occurred with increasing protective measures since the late 1980s (Williamson 2002).&#160; By 1999, 60% of U.S. and Canadian states and provinces reported increasing populations, and other jurisdictions appeared to be either stable or fluctuating with no clear trend (Garshelis and Hristienko 2006).&#160; Many of these trend assessments, though, were not derived from serial estimates of population size.<br/> <br/> Based on sums of estimates for individual states, the total U.S. population, excluding Alaska, is estimated at somewhat greater than 300,000.&#160; No reliable estimate exists for numbers of black bears in Alaska, although authorities presume there to be 100,000–200,000 animals.&#160; Similarly, large populations in most parts of Canada are not reliably known, but countrywide estimates center around 450,000 (principally in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec).&#160;Thus, the total number of black bears in North America is likely within the range 850,000–950,000.&#160; No population estimates exist for the country of Mexico, although some areas within Mexico have high and increasing black bear densities (SEMARNAP 1999, Doan-Crider 2003).<br/> <br/> Many population size or density estimates have been derived using rigorous mark–recapture approaches.&#160;Densities have been reported as high as 155 independent black bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (on an Alaskan island with legal hunting and abundant natural foods; Peacock <em>et al. </em>2011) and 214 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (coastal North Carolina with abundant agricultural crops consumed by bears; van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012) to as low as 5 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (interior Alaska; Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997; and pine forest with little food or cover in coastal South Carolina; Drewry <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Some mark–recapture population estimates have been conducted over large geographic areas, encompassing whole states or provinces or numerous study sites across the state or province (e.g., Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ontario: Garshelis and Visser 1997, Garshelis and Noyce 2006, Dreher <em>et al.</em> 2007, Belant <em>et al. </em>2011, Howe <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lackey <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Population trend information is also commonly derived from mark–recapture or from population reconstruction or modelling using ages of legally-harvested bears (Fieberg et al. 2010).&#160; Population size and trend information are routinely used by management agencies to regulate harvest pressure and inform trends in human–bear conflicts.&#160; Detailed demographic studies have revealed that survival and recruitment of American black bears is closely tied to year-to-year variation in natural food abundance (Costello <em>et al. </em>2003, Reynolds-Hogland <em>et al. </em>2007, Obbard and Howe 2008, McCall <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Once portrayed as having one of the lowest rates of reproduction of any land mammal in North America, American black bears in some parts of the range, especially in the East and Midwest, are now known to have higher reproductive rates than previously reported (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160; With controls on human-caused mortality, populations can increase rapidly, and spread through immigration. A black bear population in interior Alaska that was almost entirely removed to reduce predation on moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) completely recovered in 4–6 years by immigration (of both sexes) from the surrounding landscape (Keech <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>",Increasing,"<p>American black bears range across three countries: 12 provinces and territories of Canada (all except Prince Edward Island, where they were once abundant, but the last known one shot in 1927; Sobey 2007); 41 U.S. states (with sightings but undefined ranges in 5 other states); and 6 states of northern Mexico (Scheick and McCown 2014) (with sightings in 4 other Mexican states and a recent record of a dead bear farther south in the state of Hidalgo; Rojas-Martínez and Juárez-Casillas 2013). The species never existed outside of these three countries, although the southern historic limit is not well known. The present range falls within 69°29´ to 23°14´ N (with the incidental record in Hidalgo at 21°05’30” N) and 52°49´ to 164°10´W.<br/> <br/> In western parts of their range, American black bears broadly overlap and compete with grizzly/brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) (Mattson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013). Black bears occupy several islands off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia, but do not coexist with brown bears on any islands.&#160; Northward, black bears narrowly overlap with polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) along the Québec coast of Ungava peninsula, the Ontario and Québec coasts of James Bay, and along the Ontario and Manitoba coasts of Hudson Bay.&#160; Climate change seems to have enabled black bears to range farther north. For example, there have been recent sightings of black bears near Salluit, the second northernmost Inuit community in Québec (62°12'N) (S. Côté, Laval University, Québec City, personal communication, 2015).&#160; Along the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut, local hunters from the community of Arviat (61°5'N) have observed black bears about 50 km west of the village.&#160; These sightings have occurred since 2005, were of single individuals, and are considered to be rare (D. Lee, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, personal communication, 2014) but are farther north than similarly rare excursions noted by Jonkel and Miller (1970).<br/> <br/> Loss of habitat and unregulated hunting/persecution resulted in extirpation of black bears across large portions of their range by the early 1900s.&#160; Present occupied range covers 10.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, representing 65–75% of the historical range, depending on whether Midwestern prairies are counted as historical range (Scheick and McCown 2014). &#160;Black bears were documented along some wooded river courses through the Great Plains (e.g., Lewis and Clark expedition, 1804–1806; Laliberte and Ripple 2003), but were likely scarce in the grasslands. More of the original distribution remains in Canada (&gt;95%; 6.9 million km<sup>2</sup>) than the U.S. (45–60%; 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup>). However, recolonization from growing neighboring populations, in some cases assisted by translocations, have occurred across the U.S., including several previously extirpated states: Rhode Island and Connecticut in the Northeast (Cardoza 1976, Scheick and McCown 2014), Kentucky in the Southeast (Unger <em>et al</em>. 2013), Ohio, Oklahoma and Missouri in the Midwest (Bales <em>et al</em>. 2005, Scheick and McCown 2014, Wilton <em>et al</em>. 2014; although genetic studies suggest that Missouri bears may not have been completely extirpated ― Faries et al. 2013, Puckett <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Texas (Onorato and Hellgren 2001) and Nevada in the Southwest (including areas that were erroneously thought to be outside historic range; Lackey<em> et al</em>. 2013). The current distribution in Mexico (at least 99,000 km<sup>2</sup>) is believed to have been drastically reduced from an unknown historical extent due to deforestation, hunting, and incidental killing from predator poisoning (Delfín-Alfonso <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, these bears are also now expanding and reoccupying portions of their former range, and possibly new areas because of artificial water and food sources.</p>","<p>A looming concern, but not a widespread problem in North America, is the poaching of bears for their paws and gall bladders, which may be sold commercially. Those products, particularly bile from gall bladders, are highly valued by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine.&#160; Several U.S. states and Canadian provinces allow the sale of bear parts taken legally by hunters, either within that jurisdiction or transported into that jurisdiction from elsewhere (Williamson 2002). An argument can be made that this creates opportunities for poachers to employ an illicit pathway into the legal, commercial trade. However, illegal trade appears to be very limited.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>n the U.S. and Canada, black bears are managed by individual states and provinces, so although an IUCN conservation action plan exists for this species (Pelton et al. 1999), each state and province sets their own goals and methods for achieving those goals.&#160; As a whole, this has worked well to re-establish robust populations of black bears across their range. Several key factors aided the rapid rebound of American black bears since the 1980s: (1) improved habitat, (2) large dispersal distances in high-quality habitat (Moore et al. 2014), (3) relatively high reproductive rates, (4) reduced human-caused mortality, and (5) better information about the biology and ecology of bears combined with better population monitoring techniques (Miller 1990).<br/> <br/> Much forested habitat, essential for black bears, was cleared indiscriminately for agriculture during the 1700s–mid-1900s, but has since returned in many parts of the U.S. Most notably, northeastern U.S. (New England) has been naturally reforested back to near its pre-colonial extent (~400 years ago; Hall <em>et al. </em>2002), although tree composition is different (fewer hard mast-producing trees as food for bears; Thompson <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Some states and provinces also manage habitat to benefit bears (e.g., space, foods, travelways, den sites; Pelton <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/> <br/> Through the 1800s and early 1900s in some areas, black bears were extensively hunted for meat, skins, and grease (i.e., market hunting; Smith <em>et al. </em>1991, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013) or hunted or poisoned with the intent of eliminating or severely reducing their numbers to reduce damage to crops and livestock (Cardoza 1976, Raybourne 1987).&#160; Governments often paid a bounty to encourage the killing of black bears.&#160; Protection and recovery occurred state-by-state and province-by-province during 1902–1983 as laws were changed and bears gained protection as a big game species (Miller 1990).&#160;Thereafter, the number and sex of bears killed were more closely controlled through hunting regulations and restrictions on numbers of hunters.&#160; By the 1980s, under the belief that black bears reproduced slowly and were easily over-harvested, most management agencies took a conservative approach to black bear hunting to enable populations to increase (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;Moreover, an infrastructure of wildlife management agency personnel and hunters policed illegal take.<br/> <br/> Wildlife management agencies have also taken an increasingly active role in reducing the number of bears killed in conflict situations through stricter laws against shooting and feeding (in some jurisdictions, feeding bears is illegal), and educational programs aimed at coexisting with bears by reducing attractants, promoting public tolerance, and recognizing that black bears are typically not a threat to human safety (Treves <em>et al. </em>2009, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> In Mexico all hunting seasons for American black bears have been closed since 1985, and the species is considered nationally endangered.&#160;Numerous conservation initiatives established by large private ranches and land cooperatives in northern Mexico have created large blocks of suitable habitat (e.g., oak-dominated forests) with protection from poaching (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160;Changing public attitudes toward bears in Mexico have also contributed to the recovery and expansion of the species (SEMARNAP 1999, Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Although bear populations are clearly increasing, population estimation and monitoring efforts are lacking because funding (normally associated with hunting fees in the U.S. and Canada) is not available.&#160;Hunting bans will likely not be lifted without better documentation of population size and trend.<br/> <br/> In the southeastern U.S., where black bears now occupy 27–37% of their historic range (depending on whether primary range or total bear range are counted as occupied range; Scheick and McCown 2014), population recovery was aided by the establishment of national parks and other sanctuaries in the Appalachian Mountains and the Coastal Plain (Pelton and van Manen 1997).&#160;These large areas protect the habitat (especially mast-producing trees) and restrict hunter access.&#160;Beginning in the early 1970s, additional areas were established where bear hunting was prohibited, thus linking protected areas to other forested lands, including many private lands.&#160;the resulting conglomerates serve as dedicated or defacto sanctuaries, especially for adult females, that are a source for bears expanding into other areas (Beringer <em>et al. </em>1998, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> In some areas, populations of American black bears have either been augmented or reintroduced after former extirpation by transplanting bears from elsewhere (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; Reintroductions into Arkansas during the 1960s were highly successful (Smith <em>et al. </em>1991).&#160; Licensed hunters in this state now harvest several hundred bears annually, and bears from Arkansas have expanded into neighboring states. Further reintroductions within Arkansas have been conducted more recently (Wear <em>et al. </em>2005). A successful reintroduction augmented a newly-spawning population in Kentucky (Unger <em>et al. </em>2013). Augmentation of several populations in Louisiana during the mid-1960s likely contributed to population recovery there.<br/> <br/> The Louisiana black bear (<em>U. a. luteolus</em>), a recognized subspecies of American black bear, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1992 as a result of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality (Bowker and Jacobson 1995).&#160;At the time of the listing, and since then, the validity and integrity of this subspecies has been debated (Pelton 1991, Kennedy <em>et al</em>. 2002, Csiki <em>et al. </em>2003, Puckett <em>et al. </em>2015). Under this ruling, all bears within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear, from east Texas to southern Mississippi, have been protected.&#160;Much of the bottomland hardwood forest that the Louisiana black bear historically inhabited had been converted to agriculture.&#160;Since 1992, remnant bottomland hardwoods have been protected, and some marginal farmland converted to hardwood trees.&#160; Moreover, a new population of bears within Louisiana was established by translocating bears from other Louisiana populations (Benson and Chamberlain 2007) in order to create a stepping-stone between two separated populations; this enabled bears to travel between them (Laufenberg and Clark 2014).&#160;One irony is that the stepping-stone successfully linked a population that was believed to be native Louisiana black bears with a population that had previously been established by translocating <em>U. a. americanus</em> bears from Minnesota (1964–1967). The Minnesota bears had clearly adapted to the very different habitat and weather conditions in Louisiana, as they have been established there for three generations and their numbers have been increasing.&#160;However, if the <em>luteolus</em> subspecies has any merit, the successful establishment of a conservation corridor reduced the purity of that genetic stock.<br/> <br/> The conservation efforts in Louisiana have been further enhanced through public information and education.&#160;This management program is organized by a broad coalition of state and federal agencies, conservation groups, forestry and agricultural industries, and private landowners.&#160;As a result, bears have been noticeably increasing in numbers and distribution in all three range states, although a breeding population does not yet exist in east Texas.&#160; Large, contiguous forested habitat capable of sustaining a population of black bears exists within the historical range of the subspecies in east Texas (Kaminski <em>et al. </em>2013); however, surveys of local people indicate concern over potential conflicts with an established bear population in the area (Morzillo <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the Louisiana black bear, based largely on a rigorous study (Laufenberg and Clark 2014) that showed that all of the population criteria for recovery had been attained and adequate safeguards against future threats were in place (Fuller 2015).<br/> <br/> Another typically-accepted subspecies of black bear (<em>U. a. floridanus</em>) was listed as threatened by the state of Florida in 1974, although legal hunting continued in some population strongholds until 1994.&#160;Habitat degradation, and bears being killed on highways and in conflicts with people are the primary threats to these bears. The fragmented habitat contributes to the high vehicle kills and human interactions. A public petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the Florida black bear as a federally threatened species was denied in 1992.&#160;A black bear management plan, adopted in 1993, directed the state management agency to conserve habitat and reduce human-caused bear mortalities. These efforts, particularly habitat conservation measures and changes in human attitudes toward bears, supported a steady population increase (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;Florida black bears have been expanding into areas of unoccupied habitat as regrowth of understory and forests improve habitat quality, even as development reduces habitat quantity.&#160; In 2010 the status of the Florida black bear was re-evaluated using IUCN redlisting criteria, and after a thorough, peer-reviewed biological assessment and development of a management plan, the species was removed from the state’s threatened species list in 2012 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;A hunt was initiated in 2015.<br/> <br/> In British Columbia much conservation attention has been directed toward the Kermode subspecies <em>(U. a. kermodei</em>).&#160;This animal is commonly referred to as the “spirit bear” because it possesses a gene that when homozygous is manifested as white pelage (Ritland <em>et al. 2</em>001).&#160; White-phased animals have long been protected from hunting.&#160; A large system of protected areas was established in 2006 (Great Bear Rainforest Agreement) to ban or severely restrict logging within &gt;200,000 ha of coastal temperate rainforest inhabited by this subspecies of black bear, as well as by brown bears.&#160; Additionally, the spirit bear was selected as the official provincial mammal of British Columbia.<br/> <br/> Since 1992 all American black bears have been listed in Appendix II of CITES, under the similarity of appearance provision (Article II, para 2b).&#160; This listing stipulates that documentation of legal harvest is necessary for the import and export of body parts in order to prevent these from being confused as parts from illegally obtained bears.&#160; This listing was not designed to protect American black bears, but rather other species of threatened bears, particularly the Asiatic black bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), whose parts might otherwise be sold under the guise of being from American black bear.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

No major population declines are reported, with a number of populations occurring in large and well-managed protected areas.","An inhabitant of grasslands, sagebrush plains, deserts, and foothills; avoiding closed habitats with limited lines of sight. They range from near sea-level to 3,350 m (O'Gara 1999). Their need for free water varies with the succulence of the vegetation in their diet. Some populations undertake seasonal movements, sometimes moving as much as 160 km from their summering area (O'Gara 1978). They usually occur in small bands, but large winter herds disperse in spring. Forms separate bachelor and female-kid groups in spring and summer. Males associate with females in late summer and early fall. Breeding takes place mid-September to early October in the north, and from late July to early October in south.<br/><br/>In winter, northern populations depend heavily on browse, especially sagebrush; forbs are most important in summer. Southern populations use more forbs and less browse. They also take grasses, and, in some areas, cacti.","The original decline in numbers of Pronghorn was most likely due to hunting, combined with a drastic reduction of available habitat due to habitat loss from agricultural, urban, and mining expansion onto historic lands; fencing across routes of seasonal movements; removal of native vegetation by rangeland rehabilitation projects; and heavy livestock grazing (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998). However, effective law enforcement, and habitat and wildlife management techniques during the mid-1900s helped Pronghorn stage a remarkable recovery (Yoakum 1968).<br/><br/>Today, there are no major range-wide threats, although localized declines are taking place, particularly to the Sonoran Pronghorn, mainly as a result of, among others, livestock grazing, the construction of roads, fences and other barriers that pose barriers to historical habitat, illegal hunting (mainly in Mexico), insufficient forage and water, and lack of recruitment (see U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998 for review). Pronghorn usually inhabit large expanses of contiguous habitat and once such regions become fragmented beyond some threshold, use by Pronghorn generally decreases.","In the early 1800s, there were probably upwards of 35 million Pronghorn. By 1924, they were believed to be near extinction with less than 20,000 animals remaining. From 1924 to 1964 the population increased ten-fold  (O'Gara 1978). <br/><br/>Today, numbers are estimated at about 1 million with around half occurring in Wyoming though numbers fluctuate with the severity of droughts and winters (O'Gara 1999, Byers 2011). They are generally declining in Mexico, although more stable in the remainder of the range. Many local populations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>It is estimated that there are fewer than 300 individuals of Sonoran Pronghorn in the United States and 200-500 individuals in Mexico (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998). There are around 200 Peninsular Pronghorn in and around breeding centres in Baja California (Byers 2011).",Stable,"The Pronghorn occurs in western North America, from the southern Prairie Provinces of Canada (southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan) through the western U.S. to northern Mexico (Baja California, Sonora, Hidalgo).<br/><br/>The Sonoran Pronghorn&#160;occurs in southwestern Arizona (USA) and northwestern Sonora (Mexico). The Baja California or Peninsular Pronghorn is endemic to Baja California (Mexico).<br/><br/>Pronghorn was introduced onto Lanai Island (Hawaii) in 1959, where it reached a  population of about 250 in the mid-1960s; however, there were less than  12 in 1983 and it seemed headed for extinction (Tomich 1986).",Pronghorn are hunted for meat and as trophies across their range.,Terrestrial,"Populations of the Sonoran Pronghorn in Arizona and Mexico are protected under the US Endangered Species Act (since 1967), and a recovery plan for this subspecies has been prepared by the USFWS (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998).

115080297,6091,Cynomys ludovicianus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-09-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern because it is very widespread, there are estimated to be millions of individuals, and its populations are not declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a threatened category. Although it has declined in many parts of its range, there are parts of its range where they are not affected by any threats at present.","Habitat consists of dry, flat or gently sloping, open grasslands with low, relatively sparse vegetation, including areas overgrazed by cattle. The species occurs in open vacant lots at town edges in some areas. Young are born in underground burrows. <br/><br/>Habitat includes all major grassland types - short, mixed and tall; most abundant and an important community member in the Mixed Grass Prairie and Short Grass Plains associations (Carpenter 1940, in Osborn 1942). Tallgrass prairie habitat is mainly areas where wild or domestic ungulates or other disturbance has reduced the stature of the tallgrass; prairie dogs maintain the vegetation in a low stature.<br/><br/>Fine to medium textured soils are preferred (Koford 1958), presumably because burrows and other structures tend to retain their shape and strength better than in coarse, loose soils. However, sandy soils often support larger, coarser graminoids with lower forage quality; prairie dogs may avoid these forages and thus associated sandy areas. Colonies commonly are found on silty clay loams, sandy clay loams, and loams (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 1986). Encroachment into sands (e.g., loamy fine sand) occurs if the habitat is needed for colony expansion (Osborn 1942). <br/><br/>By colonizing areas with low vegetative stature, prairie dogs often select areas with past human (as well as animal) disturbance. In North Dakota and Montana, colonies tended to be associated with areas heavily used by cattle, such as water tanks and long-term supplemental feeding sites (Licht and Sanchez 1993).<br/><br/>Breeding system is harem-polygamous, with most females copulating with one male and males with several females (Hoogland and Folts 1982). Litter size typically averages about four. Individual females produce one litter per year.","Threats fall into four main categories. 1) Exotic disease, particularly sylvatic plague (<em>Yersinia pestis</em>) to which prairie dogs are highly susceptible. 2) Loss of habitat to agriculture and urbanization. 3) Habitat fragmentation and its many effects. 4) Control activities by government, private organizations, and individuals via poisoning and shooting. <br/><br/>EXOTIC SPECIES/DISEASE: Sylvatic plague was introduced to North America around 1899 (Cully 1989) and first reported in black-tailed prairie dogs from Texas in the mid-1940s (Reading <em>et al.</em> 1989). It is a serious threat given its pervasiveness and efficacy, as it can kill more than 99% of prairie dogs in a colony (Cully 1989), and numbers do not appear to fully recover (USFWS 2002). Though prairie dogs have persisted in the presence of plague since about 1900 and prairie dog numbers are high given habitat loss and control efforts, plague is still of concern to local populations and for long-term persistence. Plague is not well documented in black-tailed prairie dogs across their range though there is no reason to believe that plague is not as significant in black-tailed as it is in white-tailed prairie dogs (Cully 1992). On large areas originally selected as possible ferret reintroduction sites, declines of up to 90 per cent from about 1985-2000 are ""generally attributed to sylvatic plague"" (USFWS 2000). Only about 10 percent of the historical range is both plague-free and available (not cropland) (USFWS 2000). Widespread outbreaks in 2001 may indicate the beginning of an 'up' cycle in plague occurrence (USFWS 2002). The significance of plague in range-wide prairie dog mortality is unclear, though experts agree that where plague occurs it is extremely important in population dynamics (Cully 1992). Plague may be introduced into a colony by other species or by dispersing prairie dogs, which bring plague-ridden fleas into a colony.<br/><br/>USFWS (2004) noted that: (1) High exposure doses of plague bacilli may be necessary for disease contraction in some individuals; (2) limited immune response has been observed in some individuals; (3) a population dynamic may have developed in low-density, isolated populations that contributes to the persistence of these populations; (4) the apparent ability of some sites to recover to pre-plague levels after a plague epizootic; and (5) approximately one-third of the species' historic range has not been affected by plague. Based on this and on recent estimates of occupied habitat, USFWS (2004) concluded that plague no longer appears to be as significant a threat as previously thought and that plague in combination with other factors is not likely to cause the black-tailed prairie dog to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION: Habitat loss has been an important factor in prairie dog declines in the past. Cheatheam (1977) estimated that about 36% of the land area in regions used by prairie dogs was covered by water developments, urban expansion, cropland, and improved pasture. Similarly, Bishop and Culbertson (1976) detected extensive colony loss on river terraces as a result of farming activities. Conversion of native prairie to farmland does not necessarily represent habitat loss to prairie dogs, but farmers will not tolerate prairie dogs in their fields (Merriam 1902). Similarly, prairie dogs prosper in empty urban lots and fields, yet this is not often tolerated given the plague risk. However, in New Mexico, urban (Gunnison's) prairie dogs are often allowed to remain because colony fleas are killed instead. Still, developments that destroy patches of grassland (e.g., roads, buildings, water impoundments) result in loss of potential prairie dog habitat and restriction of area for colony expansion.  <br/><br/>USFWS (2004) concluded that present or threatened habitat destruction is not a threat to the species, although considerable effects due to this factor have occurred in the past. Additionally, USFWS concluded that present or threatened habitat modification as it relates to plague is not a significant threat to the species.<br/><br/>CONTROL: Control by humans, interacting with low forage production, is probably the main cause of loss of the prairie dog from the more arid parts of its range, including southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona (Cully 1992) and Texas (see map in Cheatheam 1977). For most of the 20th century, Animal Damage Control, its forerunners, and other control agencies worked hard to eliminate prairie dogs over wide areas (Cully 1992). Towns were poisoned primarily with strychnine and zinc-phosphide baits (e.g., oats mixed with rodenticide). Poisoning was immediately followed up with extermination of any remaining living prairie dogs (Cully 1992). Indeed, control efforts, with some help from plague, resulted in a reduction in prairie dog acreage from 700,000,000 to 1,500,000 in 1971 (Cain <em>et al.</em> 1971, in Fagerstone and Biggins 1986; Cully 1989). Today prairie dog poisoning efforts are limited to local, problem populations and entail control, not extermination. Public control agencies, including ADC, do very little prairie dog control work, as most control is practiced by land managers. These agencies do provide technical information and assistance, however.<br/><br/>USFWS (2004) acknowledged extant and potentially significant local population reductions due to chemical control of prairie dogs but concluded that impacts due to this factor are not a threat to the extent that the species could become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>USFWS (2004) acknowledged that recreational shooting can reduce population densities at specific sites and that extirpation possibly may have occurred in isolated circumstances due to this factor. However, USFWS noted that populations can recover from very low numbers following intensive recreational shooting and therefore concluded that effects due to recreational shooting do not constitute a significant threat.<br/><br/>Distribution, abundance, and trend data indicate that inadequate regulatory mechanisms are not limiting black-tailed prairie dog populations at present, nor are they likely to within the foreseeable future (USFWS 2004).","The total population size in the early 2000s was estimated at between 3,684,000 and 33,156,000; using average density figures, the estimated population was 18,420,000 (USFWS 2004). <br/><br/>This species is represented by a very large number of occurrences or subpopulations. Most occurrences are represented by relatively small populations, and it is unknown how many are viable in the long term, but certainly there are at least several dozen occurrences with good viability.<br/><br/>Currently, the species is declining in some areas, increasing in others; overall trend at present is probably stable or slightly decreasing, with a long-term outlook of slow decline (USFWS 2002). A small stable population exists in Canada (USFWS 2004). Range and abundance appear to be relatively stable in Mexico in recent decades (USFWS 2004).<br/><br/>Area of occupancy has been reduced from about 40 million hectares historically to about 766,400 hectares (USFWS 2004), a decline of about 98 per cent. Range contractions have occurred in the southwestern portion of the range in Arizona, western New Mexico, and western Texas through conversion of grasslands to desert shrublands; in the eastern portion of the range, range contractions are largely due to habitat destruction through cropland development in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas (USFWS 2004). Approximately 37 per cent of the historical habitat has been converted to cropland, now generally unavailable due to continuous disturbance. <br/><br/>Prairie dog towns formerly were much larger than at present. For example, one town in central Oklahoma stretched 35 km (Tyler 1968). In 1998, maximum town size in Oklahoma was 427 ha; length 2.1 km) (Lomolino and Smith 2001).<br/><br/>Density of prairie dogs fluctuates within and between years according to colony demographics, environmental conditions, forage availability, and soil and/or vegetation sites within towns (Koford 1958). Typical adult densities are about 12 per hectare (Koford 1958).",Decreasing,"This is primarily a Great Plains species, originally occurring from extreme southern Saskatchewan in Canada (Frenchman River Valley), and Montana south through the western and central Great Plains to the desert grasslands of western Texas, New Mexico, southeastern Arizona (formerly) in the United States, and northeastern Sonora, and northern Chihuahua in Mexico (Koford 1958).

Listed as Least Concern.","Inhabits mountain steppes and alpine meadows (up to 4000 m) spreading over gentle slopes.  Fewer live in stony mountain steppes strewn with boulders. Where the Gray Marmot lives in sympatry with the Siberian Marmot, the Gray Marmot occupies only tips of ridges characterized by alpine vegetation while the Siberian Marmot inhabits productive highland valleys. This species, like most marmots, is highly social, and lives in colonies with many burrows.  Summer and winter burrows are usually separate; winter burrows are deeper, while summer burrows are just as long, but not as deep; both types may hold 2-3 marmots, but in winter, up to 10. Marmots eat a wide variety of food plants, which vary with season. Early spring foods include Artemisia frigida; by late spring and early summer their diet consists mainly of grasses; and by late summer, herbaceous vegetation. Sometimes can eat animals.  Mating begins in early May and ends by the beginning of June.  Gestation lasts 40 days. Reproduces once a year, litter size is 2-6 pups.  Hibernation is initiated at different times in different places, from August to October, and appears influenced by local weather and food resources. Hibernation lasts 7-8 months.

115130419,15951,Panthera leo,Vulnerable,A2abcd,2016,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>  </p>The Lion population is inferred to have undergone a reduction of approximately 43% over the past 21 years (approximately three Lion generations, 1993-2014).<br/><br/>We infer a decline of 43% based on time trend analysis of census data for 47 relatively well monitored Lion subpopulations. These subpopulations approximately totalled an estimated 7,500 Lions in 2014 and comprise a substantial portion of the total species population, so that we feel confident in applying observed trends to the species as a whole as well as on a regional basis.<br/><br/>The overall classification of the Lion as Vulnerable masks a dichotomy: we observe that sample Lion subpopulations increased by 12% in four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in India, while an observed decline of 60% in sample subpopulations outside these countries is inferred for the remainder of its African range. In other words, in the majority of its range the Lion meets the A2 criterion for Endangered with the inferred rate of decline over 50% in three generations, but this trend is numerically mitigated by a small number of subpopulations in a restricted geographical range.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is reflected in listings of the species in different Red Lists: in South Africa, the Lion will be categorized as Least Concern on the national Red List in preparation (Child <em>et al</em>. In prep.), whereas in India it is Endangered (as subspecies <em>P. l. persica</em> on the global IUCN Red List: Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2008) and in the region of West Africa meets the criteria for Critically Endangered (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015).&#160; The range state list in Table 1 (attached Supporting Material) further illustrates the high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, as Lions have been recently extirpated in 12 African countries and we suspect possible recent extirpation in another four.<br/><br/>Among the causes of decline, the most important are indiscriminate killing in defence of human life and livestock, habitat loss, and prey base depletion. Prey base depletion is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al</em>. 2013). An emerging threat is trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (IUCN 2006a, b; Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, although trophy hunting contributes positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices have been recommended (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2013, Edwards<em> et al</em>. 2014), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Croes <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). While attention is currently focused on Lion hunting reforms to ensure sustainability, the leading causes of population decline are more difficult to address and are likely to continue. The observed and inferred reductions are based on direct observation; appropriate indices of abundance; declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality; and actual and potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in southern Africa. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is properly funded; fencing is one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets are low, leading to local decline and even extinction, for example in West Africa (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160; Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic and South Sudan, but we fear drastic declines especially for the latter two.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we assess the Lion as Vulnerable based on criterion A, more specifically A2abcd. Lion range and abundance exceed the Vulnerable thresholds for criteria B, C and D, respectively, so these criteria do not contribute to the present assessment, whilst criterion E was not applied. Vulnerable A2abcd is the same listing as the previous assessment but with a different underlying method. Previous assessments were based on a suspected decline of the total estimated number of Lions, which necessarily included low quality data. In the present assessment we did not use total Lion estimates, because we had a better alternative. We now have enough good quality data for a representative sub-set of Lion subpopulations to calculate an observed decline, from which we infer a decline for the species as a whole.<br/><p>  </p>","The Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer 2013). Although Lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but Lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills.<br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting. Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266-4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001).<br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic Lion is dry deciduous forest. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al</em>. 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic Lion's diet, although the most common prey is the Chital Deer. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","<p>The main threats to Lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock) and prey base depletion. Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hazzah <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol <em>et al</em>. 1985, Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Loveridge <em>et al</em>. 2007, Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunter<em> et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>Disease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Trinkel <em>et al</em>. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).<br/></p>","<p><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>This assessment is based on a time trend analysis of census data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013, plus additional unpublished data provided by contributors). Census estimates were obtained by scientific research methods including total count, individual identifications, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photo databases, spoor counts and density estimates based on direct observations corrected for patrol effort.&#160;These methods are rated as producing the most reliable type of Lion population estimates by background papers for the 2006 IUCN regional Lion workshops (Table 5 in Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b).&#160;We did not include population estimates for sites which were based on extrapolation of Lion densities obtained by research in other areas, or informed guesstimates by researchers. The minimum number of census surveys per site over the assessment time period is two, but some sites have been more regularly monitored (Table 3 - Data Points column, in Supplementary Material).&#160;In some cases census methodology varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em>et al</em>. (2013):</p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR</p><p>Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; R<sub>span</sub> = 15.5 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 12 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013)</p><p>Thus GL = 12*0.29 +3.5 = 6.98 yrs<br/><br/>To fill gaps between censuses conducted in non-consecutive years, we interpolated population sizes, assuming a linear change between years. For surveys conducted for only a few years between 1993 and 2014, we extrapolated to the beginning and end points based on an exponential rate of change taken from the observed growth rate for each respective subpopulation. However, all extrapolations are capped by the estimated carrying capacity for each reserve so that subpopulations that experienced dramatic population change were not assumed to have been at implausibly high totals in either 1993 or 2014. Subpopulations were first categorized according to whether or not the reserves were surrounded by a fence; unfenced subpopulations were further categorized according to geographical location with the exception of Niassa Reserve (Mozambique), treated as an outlier as discussed below.<br/><br/>In graph form (Figures 1-4 in the Supplementary Material) we summarize the repeated censuses of 46 different African Lion subpopulations using all available repeat-survey data. Figure 5 (in the Supplementary Material) addresses the 47th Lion subpopulation in our analysis, the only Asian subpopulation.<br/><br/>Outside parts of southern Africa, Lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62% between 1993 and 2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).&#160; Although these totals only included about 4,600 Lions in the year 1993, several surveyed areas are restricted to the best-protected portions of much larger ecosystems (e.g., the phototourism areas of Selous and Serengeti).<br/><br/>In contrast, the total number of Lions in six unfenced reserves in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe only declined by about 11% (Figure 2, Supplementary Material). Note that the overall stability in southern Africa masks considerable heterogeneity: between 1993 and 2014 the monitored Lion subpopulation in a portion of the Okavango ecosystem is estimated to have declined by 46%, whereas the much smaller subpopulations in Gonarezhou and Kunene have increased dramatically.<br/><br/>The striking contrast between these three countries in southern Africa and the rest of the continent is probably related to the equally striking differences in human population densities (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013) in Namibia (2.5/km²), Botswana (3.4) and Zimbabwe (26) vs. Benin (78), Burkina Faso (57), Cameroon (40), Cote d’Ivoire (64), Ghana (102), Kenya (67), Nigeria (189), Rwanda (420), Senegal (68), Tanzania (48), Uganda (137) and Zambia (45).<br/><br/>The unfenced Niassa subpopulation is estimated to have increased by over 250% since 1993 (Figure 3, Supplementary Material); despite severe bushmeat poaching the Lions are still recovering from excessive prey depletion during civil war. In addition, on a shorter time scale, Lions have benefited from extensive ivory poaching, which has provided them with sizeable quantities of elephant meat (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2014). Human population density in Mozambique is 74/km² with sizeable numbers of people living inside Niassa Reserve, so unless management is further strengthened, this unfenced Lion subpopulation may soon experience declining food supplies and increased human-lion conflicts. These arguments strongly suggest that the ‘boom’ in the Niassa Lion subpopulation has stopped and is unlikely to be repeated in the future. We therefore consider Niassa to be a special case and treat it as an outlier in our analyses, we believe that this offers a better understanding of trends, but we note that this does not alter the assessment (with Niassa included, the assessment would still be Vulnerable A2abcd).<br/><br/>The 16 fenced African subpopulations (10 in South Africa, and all but one in southern Africa) have grown by 29% since 1993, most having already reached their presumed carrying capacities by 2013 (Figure 4, Supplementary Material). Note that although these numbers now total over 3,226 lions, our data come from the great majority of fenced reserves in Africa and that little further growth can be expected in these subpopulations.<br/><br/>Asia is home to a single contiguous subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat (Figure 5, Supplementary Material). While the population has stabilized inside the Gir Reserve, the so-called “satellite” population in the surrounding countryside has expanded by ~400% in the past 21 years.<br/><br/>The 47 sample Lion subpopulations totalled an estimated 9,615 lions in 1993 (excluding Niassa, which is treated as an outlier as described above); that number shrank by 22% to 7,455 lions in 2014 (Table 2, Supplementary Material).&#160; However, as described above, there are significant regional differences evident in population trend, and we use these to inform our inferences about population trend for the species as a whole. Table 2 (Supplementary Material) groups the sample subpopulations by region in Africa, following the IUCN (2006a, b) regional Lion conservation strategies, but combining West and Central Africa due to a small sample size for Central Africa.&#160; In Southern Africa, the sample population grew by 8%, while in sharp contrast, sample populations declined by 59% in Eastern Africa and 66% in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Table 3 (Supplementary Material) shows the estimated Lion population size in 1993 and 2014 for each of the 47 sample subpopulations with percentage change, and it can be seen that most countries had a declining trend for sample Lion subpopulations, with only four countries (India, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) seeing a growth trend. Table 4 (Supplementary Material) groups these countries with Botswana, which had a relatively low average rate of decline for its sample populations; two out of three sample subpopulations increased; the decline documented in the Okavango subpopulation was restricted to only part of the protected area; and overall 2012 estimates for the national population suggest that it his increased since 2003 (C. Winterbach unpubl. data). Mozambique is not included in this group as the increasing trend in its Niassa subpopulation is treated as an outlier in this analysis. The sample Lion population in five countries (Botswana, India, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) grew by an estimated 12%, whereas the Lion population in the remaining African range countries declined by an estimated 61% (Table 4, Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We infer population trend for the total Lion species population based on these two rates of change, as follows. In 2002, two separate country compilations of population estimates for Lions in Africa estimated the number of Lions in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to comprise between 1/4 to 1/3 of the total African Lion population, as shown in Table 5 (Supplementary Material). We suspect that this proportion was somewhat lower in 1993, given that the number of Lions is inferred to have increased in these countries while decreasing in the remainder, and use a figure of 1/4 or 25% for our species population trend calculation. If 25% of the Lion population increased by 12%, and 75% decreased by 60%, this results in an inferred trend of (0.75*-60%) + (0.25*12%) = -43% between 1993 and 2014 (Table 6, Supplementary Material).</p><br/>This qualifies the Lion as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that the vast majority of the population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the criteria for Endangered. Since our sample subpopulations were all monitored, we suspect an even greater average rate of decline for unmonitored unfenced subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort.<br/><br/><strong>Abundance</strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers, we present no new data. A recent paper summarized and updated efforts to estimate the population size of the African Lion leading to the most recent estimate of 32,000 lions in 67 Lion areas (Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). The paper presents some recent data, but where no new data were available it included unaltered numbers from earlier sources, such as Bauer and Van der Merwe (2004) and Chardonnet (2002). As a consequence, Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) include numbers from 2002 and 2004 for areas where we believe the downward trend described above occurred. We therefore consider these sources to be insufficiently precautionary for our purpose and feel that an assessment on numbers is less robust than our assessment based on trends. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative (see above), we decided not to use total Lion numbers for the present assessment<br/><br/>However, we do attempt to correct for outdated sources in the Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimate by application of the regional trends we found (Table 3, Supplementary Material) to the 2002 population size estimates within the respective regions (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004, Chardonnet 2002). These are two largely independent and reasonably comprehensive sets of estimated numbers that were coherent in time. Rather than presenting these numbers as in any way current, we look at how they might be expected to have changed.&#160;We calculated estimated present Lion numbers per region (Table 7, Supplementary Material) by applying the observed trend over the subsequent 12 years, except that numbers for West Africa were taken from a comprehensive recent survey (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014) because of their greater precision. As a small modification from Chardonnet (2002) we moved the estimate for Selous ecosystem to Eastern Africa to be consistent with the regional divisions used here. The two 2002 estimates were compared in detail (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2005a,b), showing the ALWG study (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004) was more conservative and stricter on data quality. Most notably, Bauer and Van Der Merwe (2004) lacked data for Ruaha and Tarangire which may hold close to 5,000 Lions. With all these considerations, we have greater confidence in an estimate of closer to 20,000 Lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000.<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty&#160;</strong>We do not have sufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates to employ them to estimate trend and for this assessment have used groupings of scientific time series site estimates as a proxy. &#160;Although these data are more numerous for Lions than for other big <em>Panthera </em>cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2015) and our treatment of it to estimate species population trend. Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2014) state that, ""All attitudes (towards uncertainty) should be explicitly documented. &#160;In situations where the spread of plausible values (after excluding extreme or unlikely values) qualifies a taxon for two or more categories of threat, the precautionary approach would recommend that the taxon be listed under the higher (more threatened) category.""&#160;<br/>As noted in Table 2 (see Supplementary Material), if the species trend is inferred directly from the total sample population trend, the result, a decline of 22%, would qualify the species as Near Threatened rather than Vulnerable. However, considering the demonstrated significant regional differences such an approach would be inappropriate.&#160;<br/>We treated Mozambique's Niassa subpopulation trend as an outlier and removed it from our trend analysis for reasons described above, but we also documented the effect of the exclusion. Some contributors proposed a second outlier: Tanzania’s Katavi subpopulation. Katavi has been consistently and repeatedly monitored, but the survey methodology was imprecise (vehicle transects: Caro 2011), this yielded a significant decline rate approaching 100% in a large population of over 1,100 estimated lions in the study site portion of the park in 1993 (Table 3). If Katavi would have been treated as an outlier and excluded from the analysis, inferred rate of decline would be 33%, and the rate of decline for Lions in East Africa would be 37%. Lions are still extant in Katavi (as shown in our map), although well below carrying capacity (Kiffner <em>et al.</em> 2008). Rather than using an arbitrary low value, we used the value documented by surveys (zero); Lions are extant but at a density so low as not to be detected. While the methodology is imprecise, it has proved reliable for carnivore monitoring in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al</em>. 2011). Furthermore, the extent of decline may have been measured with lack of precision, but population decline remains uncontested. Since it is one of only two long-term monitoring programmes in Tanzania (Caro 2011) we decided that it was important to include these data and decided that there was insufficient ground to treat it as an outlier.<br/>Another uncertainty that needs to be documented is our treatment of small fenced reserves in southern Africa. Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where intensive management practices include translocations, stocking, contraception and euthanasia. Such management is atypical, and as pointed out by Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) the Red List Guidelines are ambiguous as to the inclusion or exclusion of fenced areas. Their exclusion from the analysis would raise the inferred Lion decline rate to 49%. Following through on our supposition that unmonitored Lion populations have undergone an even higher rate than our monitored sample, this could potentially have been interpreted as a suspected rate of decline over 50%, qualifying the Lion as Endangered. However, we did not exclude fenced populations from our assessment. Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) state that such decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific. We consider that management of Lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes, aims to retain adaptive potential and follows a meta-population management approach. We further consider that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer<em> et al</em>. 2013). We find this sufficient justification for inclusion of these reserves.<br/>National estimated rates of population change are most meaningful in practice, and these are given in Table 3 in the Supplementary Material. &#160;We did not use national rates to gauge species decline, as the sample sizes are generally small and estimates of national Lion populations imprecise.",Decreasing,"Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from Northern Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lions are found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The last assessment of extant Lion range is provided by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013); they identified 67 Lion areas comprising 3.4 million km², which is 17% of historical range or about 25% of savanna Africa. We took those layers as a starting point, but made a few modifications to reflect the cautionary approach used by the IUCN Red List. Like with population numbers (see Population section), Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) copied old layers in the absence of new information. <em>De facto</em>, this means that large swathes of land are classified as Lion range based on the group exercises led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; they found 86 Lion Conservation Units (LCUs) covering 4.6 million km² or 22% of historical range (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008). Henschel <em>et al</em>. (2010, 2014) found that many of these LCUs in West and Central Africa no longer contained Lions, and the range map was adapted accordingly for this assessment. Similarly, the survey and mapping unit at Panthera conducted further range updates based on new survey results and other properly documented information from other regions. Furthermore, some of the mapped LCUs are located in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on lion persistence (e.g. Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof of the contrary, and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as Possibly Extinct but maintained Protected Areas inside them as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as Possibly Extinct could contain relict Lion subpopulations, and should be prioritized for field surveys aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Areas where we consider Lion populations Possibly Extinct total 1,811,087 km², over half (52%) of the range classified as extant by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013). We estimate extant Lion range, areas where we are reasonably confident that lions persist, based on recent records, at 1,654,375 km², or 8% of historical range. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and&#160; the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> in CITES Appendix I. CITES listing of the Lion is currently undergoing a Periodic Review process to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the present situation, with a final recommendation of the Animals Committee expected at its 28th meeting in 2015. The Animals Committee also noted recent information regarding possible changes in the nomenclature of Lions and requests its nomenclature expert to&#160; review this information (CITES AC27 WG8). <br/><br/>In Africa, Lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way Lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for Lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2006). These regional strategies have been used in many countries to develop Lion Conservation Action Plans. While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em></em>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Although a recent survey has indicated the possibility of a higher total population, up to 4,000, even if this figure is confirmed by further survey work, the number of mature individuals is likely to remain below the threshold of 2,500.","Mountain Nyalas occur at elevations of 1,800-4,300 m but are most abundant from 2,400-3,200 m (Atickem in litt. 2009, Sillero-Zubiri 2013). They frequent montane woodlands and the fringes of montane grasslands (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). Highest densities (up to 21/km²) have been recorded in the montane grasslands of Gaysay, Bale, where there is a combination of browse and grass with woodland cover to retreat to during the day (Hillman and Hillman 1987).<br/><br/>The formerly large continuous blocks of suitable woodland and Afroalpine habitat have now been reduced to a series of habitat islands in a sea of cultivated fields. It seems likely that mountain nyalas have been forced into higher areas by human increase and livestock grazing, and are also found above 3,400 m in heath forest and heathlands and on Afroalpine grasslands&#160;up to 4,300 m (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). In the eastern extreme of its distribution, a relict population was recorded in forests as low as 1,800 m (Bolton 1973).","Threatened by illegal hunting, destruction of montane forest and heathlands, encroachment by cattle, expansion of high-altitude cultivation, roads, and harassment by dogs. Permanent occupation of suitable habitat as a result of increasing human and livestock populations is exerting tremendous pressure on Mountain Nyala habitat throughout the range, with anecdotal evidence suggesting they actively avoid livestock (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). Its restricted range, and fragmented populations, make it highly vulnerable to human activities and stochastic events.","The population was estimated at 7,000-8,000 (and perhaps up to 12,500) in the 1960s (Brown 1969), and at 2,000-4,000 individuals in the 1980s (Hillman 1988). Numbers have declined since then. Mountain Nyalas may be extinct in the eastern and southern extremes of their distribution, but a few may still occur in Asba Tafari and in the border between Bale and Sidamo, south of Kofele. East (1999) calculated the population at 2,650, but subsequent information indicates that this may have been an overestimate. The main population formerly occurred in and around the Gaysay grasslands at the northern end of the Bale Mountains, and its numbers have been monitored since 1983. Numbers here increased to 1,050 by the late 1980s (Hillman 1988) as a result of creation of a national park in the 1970s which provided protection from poaching and excluded cattle grazing. Woldegebriel (1996) estimated the population prior to 1990 at 1,500 to 1,900. Unfortunately, following political unrest after the end of the war in 1991, most Mountain Nyala habitat in northern Bale was encroached by cattle and there was extensive hunting. As a result, the Gaysay population decreased to a fraction of what it was earlier. National Park staff estimated it to be 150 to 260 by 1994 (Woldegebriel 1996). There has been some  recovery since, and the Gaysay population was estimated at 550 by Refera and Bekele (2004) and Malcolm and Evangelista (2005).<br/><br/>In addition to Gaysay, there may be 80 to 120 mountain nyalas in other parts of Bale Mountains National Park, less than 100 in adjacent hunting areas to the north of the National Park, and 30 to 60 in Somkaro in west Bale (C. Sillero-Zubiri pers. obs). Malcolm and Evangelista (2005) estimated as many as 500 Mountain Nyala may occur in hunting blocks east of Bale. This would give a total population estimate for the Bale massif of 1,000-1,400. Small fragmented populations found in Arsi (Galama, Chilalo, Kaka and Munesa), and elsewhere (Kuni Muktar, Din Din, Arba Gugu) would total around 600 (Malcolm and Evangelista 2005). Therefore, it is likely that only 1,500 to 2,000 Mountain Nyalas survive throughout the range. A recent survey has indicated the total population may be higher, perhaps up to 4,000 (2,800 mature individuals) (Evangelista <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/>    <p>Recent research has shown that the largest population currently occurs outside Bale National Park on the eastern escarpment of the Bale massif, mainly in Besemena Odobullu and Shedom Berbere (Anagaw Atickem in litt. 2009). </p>",Decreasing,"The Mountain Nyala is endemic to the highlands of Ethiopia, south-east of the Rift Valley, between 6°N and 10°N. Formerly it occurred from Gara Muleta in the east to Shashamane and north Sidamo in the south, but has been eliminated from a large part of its former range. Currently, the main area of its distribution is the Bale Mountains National Park   and the eastern escarpments of the Bale massif. Smaller relict populations occur in Chercher (Amhar) Mountains (Asba Tafari, Arba Guggu, Din Din), Arsi Mountains (Chilalo, Galama, Mt Kaka, Munessa), and West Bale (Somkaro-Korduro ridge) (Hillman 1988, East 1999, Malcolm and Evangelista 2005, Atickem in litt. 2009, Sillero-Zubiri 2013).","Mountain Nyalas are extensively hunted for meat and horns, the latter used for local medicine and to make nipples for traditional milk bottles (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). Trophy hunting blocks in Arsi have been hunted out and hunting concessions have moved to Bale (legal hunting is restricted to adult males); with continued pressure by the industry for additional hunting blocks and larger quotas. Effects of current trophy-hunting programs are not well understood and current trophy hunting quotas may be unsustainable in the long-term (Sillero-Zubiri 2013). On the other hand, sustainable trophy hunting has very high potential for generating the revenue needed to fund effective conservation of this species.",Terrestrial,"Protected by law but enforcement is generally absent. Effective protection is limited to around 20 km² of habitat in Gaysay and around Bale Mountains N.P. headquarters. The Bale Mountains N.P. harbours around half the total population of Mountain Nyalas. The small Kuni-Muktar Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1990 as a second protected area for Mountain Nyala, but by 1996 this sanctuary had suffered severely from poaching, deforestation, cultivation and gully erosion, and the species no longer occurred. The recent (2011) establishment of an additional protected area in the Arsi Mountains may deliver some conservation benefit for the species (Sillero-Zubiri 2013).<br/><br/>The Mountain Nyala, along with the Ethiopian wolf, is a key flagship species for Bale Mountains N.P. and its future will be closely tied to the future of this protected area.

Forest clearings and mineral licks are important for geophagy and socialization (Elkan and Smith 2013, and references therein). Bongo are primarily browsers, but exhibit some seasonal grazing on grasses (Elkan and Smith 2013). There is a record from 4,300 m on Mount Kenya (Young and Evans 1993).","The Lowland Bongo faces an ongoing population decline as habitat destruction and hunting for meat (mainly through snares) and Bongo trophies increase with the relentless expansion of commercial forestry exploitation and human settlement (East 1999, Elkan and Smith 2013). Despite its large size Bongo is a shy and reclusive species, attributes that may offer some degree of protection from hunting.<br/><br/>Threats to Mountain Bongo include hunting with dogs and loss of habitat in the Mau and Eburu forests to illegal logging. The decline of Mountain Bongo populations in the Aberdares in recent years has been attributed to increased hunting by local people and habitat loss, and even to the increased numbers of Lion in the area (Elkan and Smith 2013). Although these factors have no doubt contributed to the decline of Mountain Bongo, the impact of disease has probably been underestimated: the grazing of cattle in the forest reserves of Mount Kenya and the Aberdares as high as the Hagenia forest on the Aberdares plateau may have greater implications for Bongo conservation than hunting pressure in terms of disease transmission (L. Estes pers. comm. in Elkan and Smith 2013). Percival (1928) reported that rinderpest drastically reduced the populations of Mountain Bongo in the 1890s, and populations are thought to have suffered greatly in later epidemics in the early 1900s.","East (1999) estimated the total population of Lowland Bongo at 28,000, with populations in the order of a few thousand in West Africa (where populations are fragmented), and tens of thousands in the Central African forest zone. It tends to be naturally rare or absent over large parts of the equatorial forest zone. Dense forest habitat, patchy distributions, wide-ranging patterns,  retiring behaviour and crepuscular/nocturnal activity patterns hinder  any reliable estimation of Bongo densities (Elkan and Smith 2013).  Hillman (1986) estimated 1.2/km² in South Sudan based on observations of  group size and distribution of mineral licks. There are no reliable estimates of current population size.<br/><br/>The current population estimate (Mountain Bongo Surveillance Project&#160;2015) for the Mountain Bongo is <em>ca</em>. 100 individuals: Aberdare Mts (&lt;50); Mt Kenya (10-15);&#160;Eburu Forest (<em>ca</em>. 10);&#160;Maasai Mau Forest Complex (20+;&#160;new Bongo groups discovered May 2013); and SW Mau Forest (&lt;10).",Decreasing,"Bongo has a disjunct distribution in three separate patches. The Western or Lowland Bongo ranges from Sierra Leone to Togo (where they now probably only occur in Fazao National Park) and Benin (where a few may still exist in the Mt. Kouffe area); and then from SW Cameroon through Central African Republic to SW South Sudan, NE Gabon, N Republic of Congo and the northern half of DR Congo (East 1999, Elkan and Smith 2013). The gap in distribution is assumed to reflect patterns of expansion and contraction of forest habitats resulting from climatic fluctuations.<br/><br/>The Eastern or Mountain Bongo formerly occurred in and around forested mountains zones of Mt. Kenya, the Aberdares, Mau forest, Cherengani hills and Chepalungu hills in Kenya and Mount Elgon in Kenya and Uganda (Elkan and Smith 2013). Mountain Bongo was exterminated from the Uganda side of Mount Elgon around 1913-1914 (Kingdon 1982) and it is now confined to four completely isolated populations in patches of forest on Mt. Kenya, Mau Forest, Eburu Forest and the Aberdares in Kenya&#160;(Elkan and Smith 2013, Mountain Bongo Surveillance Project&#160;2015).","Lowland Bongo are subject to snare hunting associated with expanding commercial forestry exploitation and high demand for Bongo trophies (Elkan and Smith 2013). In fact, Bongos are the primary target of tourist safari hunting in the forests of central Africa and increasing demand over the past decade, the use of dogs and inadequate regulation has resulted in over-hunting in several areas (Elkan 1995, 2003). In contrast, trophy hunting also has the potential to provide economic justification for the preservation of larger areas of Bongo habitat than national parks, especially in remote regions of Central Africa where possibilities for commercially successful tourism are very limited (East 1999). Traditionally, due to taboos against eating of the meat, Bongo are not considered a preferred game species by local people, at least in some sites (Hillman 1986; Elkan 1995, 2003), although there is still heavy loss due to indiscriminate snaring. Furthermore, the erosion of traditional beliefs and expanding commercial hunting are creating new pressures and its meat is sometimes smoked and sold as 'buffalo' (Elkan and Smith 2013). There has been an increase in hunting of Mountain Bongo by local people, including hunting with dogs.",Terrestrial,"As the largest and most spectacular forest antelope, the Lowland Bongo is both an important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by international sport hunters during the 1990s. Both of these factors are strong incentives to provide effective protection and management of Lowland Bongo populations.<br/><br/>East (1999) estimated that perhaps 60% of Bongo numbers were confined to protected areas. In Central Africa, these include Dzanga-Ndoki National Park and Bangassou areas of the Central African Republic, Lobeke National Park (Cameroon), and in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park and Odzala National Park (Republic of Congo); in West Africa, strongholds include Taï (Côte d’Ivoire), Sapo (Liberia), and Kakum National Parks (Ghana) (East 1999, Elkan and Smith 2013). However, because the highest known abundances of Bongo in Central Africa occur in logging concessions not protected areas, an approach is needed that incorporates both protected areas and logging concessions (Elkan 2003, Elkan and Smith 2013).<br/><br/>The Mountain Bongo’s survival in the wild is dependent on more effective protection of the surviving remnant populations in Kenya (East 1999). Two conservation initiatives are currently in progress on Mountain Bongo. A program to reintroduce Bongo to Mt Kenya began in 2004, when 18 animals where flown from North American zoos to a captive-breeding facility at Mount Kenya Game Ranch, on the north-western slope of the mountain. A second phase began in 2005, with the commencement of a research program into the Mountain Bongo’s ecology. This project will attempt to determine the configuration of Bongo habitat on both the Aberdares and Mount Kenya, using recently collected field and remotely sensed data (L. Estes pers. comm. in Elkan and Smith 2013). Meanwhile, the Bongo Surveillance Program, initiated in 2004, has been investigating the status of the remaining wild Bongo populations in Kenya (L.

Numbers are considered to be generally declining except in some core areas, but the extent of this decline overall is estimated to remain below 20% over 14 years (three generations). Given continuing habitat degradation and intensive meat hunting in parts of its range, if present trends continue, the Sitatunga may disappear from many areas where it still occurs and viable populations will eventually be largely restricted to those regions which currently support substantial, stable or increasing populations.","Sitatunga occur in tall and dense vegetation of perennial and seasonal swamps, marshy clearings within forests, riverine thickets, and mangrove swamps. In savanna environments, they are typically found in extensive monospecific stands of papyrus <em>Cyperus papyrus</em> and the reeds <em>Phragmites</em> spp. and <em>Echinochloa pyramidalis</em> (May and Lindholm 2013). Sitatunga usually avoid open water devoid of vegetation. They are selective mixed feeders taking a range of grasses, sedges and browse (May and Lindholm 2013). Sitatunga coexist with the Nile Lechwe in the Sudd of South Sudan, and with Southern Lechwe in Zambia, Botswana, and Angola.","Loss of habitat is the main threat to the future persistence of Sitatunga. The ever-increasing loss of wetlands throughout their range has cut off former routes of dispersal and many populations are becoming isolated. Sitatunga are vulnerable to long-term changes in water level because it alters vegetation structure, which in turn largely determines their distribution and abundance. Habitat fragmentation, and both lower and higher water levels make them more vulnerable to predation and meat hunting in many parts of its range (May and Lindholm 2013). Swamps are also extremely vulnerable to fire; vast areas of Bangweulu and Busanga are burnt each year (May and Lindholm 2013). Nonetheless, the Sitatunga shows a remarkable ability to survive near human habitation, provided suitable habitat remains.","The cryptic nature of Sitatunga and the relative inaccessibility of their habitat makes reliable estimates of abundance difficult. Aerial surveys tend to grossly underestimate this species’ numbers (East 1999). Densities of up to 64/km² in Akagera N.P.

East (1999) estimated a total population of 170,000, but this is likely to be an overestimate (May and Lindholm 2013). Its numbers are probably decreasing in densely settled areas but stable elsewhere.",Decreasing,"The Sitatunga probably occurred formerly alongside waterways throughout the lowland forest zone of West and Central Africa, extending into swamp systems in the savanna zones of Central, East and southern Africa. It is now rare and localized in West Africa, with a very small range in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. It may have once occurred more widely in this part of West Africa. It remains widespread elsewhere, from southern Ghana and Benin through the Congo Basin forests and in swamp systems within the savannas of Central, East and southern Africa as far as the Okavango. Long extinct in Niger and probably now also in Togo, but have been confirmed as still surviving in Ghana (May and Lindholm 2013).","Hunting has probably not had a significant effect in the past because of the inaccessibility of their habitat, but with fragmentation of swamps, increasing human population and modern technology this is changing (May and Lindholm 2013). Hunting for bushmeat throughout West Africa is now a major threat (J. Mason pers. comm. in May and Lindholm 2013).&#160;In some areas, sustainable trophy hunting is an economically important form of utilization of this species, for example, in northern Botswana, which has produced some of Africa’s largest Sitatunga trophies.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"About 40% of the population survives in and around protected areas (East 1999), with major, generally stable populations occurring in Dja and Lobeke (Cameroon), Bangassou (Central African Republic), Odzala N.P. and L.

At present, only a few of these areas receive moderate-high levels of protection and management. The current survival of good Sitatunga populations in other areas, such as Lobeke, Bangweulu and Okavango, is a product of low human population densities rather than active conservation (East 1999). <br/><br/>The large areas of swamp within the Okavango Delta currently provide the Sitatunga with a safe refuge (from hunting in particular) to persist in. They should continue to do so, as long as the ecology of the Delta is not altered significantly by factors such as cattle grazing within the swampland, uncontrolled burning, overhunting and hydrological schemes that would affect the water levels in the perennial or seasonal swamps. Moremi Game Reserve contains a limited area of permanent swamp with moderate numbers of Sitatunga, but proposals to incorporate the Xo Flats within this reserve would significantly increase the protected population of this antelope (East 1999). The species’ significance as a trophy animal is an important economic incentive for the conservation of its habitat, and hunting zones adjoining national parks and equivalent reserves have the potential to play an increasingly important role in the conservation of the Sitatunga (East 1999).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It is naturally absent from arid and semi-arid regions and from extensive areas of closed-canopy forest. They range from low altitudes near the coast in southern, East and West Africa up to 4,000 m on the mountains of East Africa (Plumptre and Wronski 2013 and references therein).&#160;Its ability to survive in human-dominated landscapes and to withstand heavy hunting pressure has enabled it to persist over much of its former range (East 1999). Bushbuck are primarily browsers; in some areas, they enter agricultural fields to eat crops and may be considered a pest (Plumptre and Wronski 2013).","Bushbuck have disappeared from some areas in the drier parts of its former range because of habitat destruction and increasing aridity, but it is expanding its distribution within the equatorial forest zone as this is opened up by human activities. There do not seem to be any major threats to its long-term conservation, although numbers may be gradually decreasing locally as hunting pressures increase in parts of its range (East 1999).","The Bushbuck reaches high densities in localized areas of favourable habitat; for example, 78 resident individuals were identified within a 2.6 km² area of open forest within Nairobi National Park (Kenya) giving a population density of 30/km², and faecal counts gave population density estimates of 11 - 44/km² in montane forest and adjoining habitats within Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda). Aerial surveys undoubtedly grossly underestimate the Bushbuck’s population density because of its preference for cover and its secretive habits. Ground surveys have produced density estimates of 0.08-1.0/m², but again the Bushbuck’s tendency to remain concealed probably results in significant undercounting in some ground surveys (East 1999, Plumpre and Wronski 2013, and references therein).<br/><br/>East (1999) estimated the total population of Bushbuck at 1,340,000, likely an underestimate.

It also occurs on some small islands off the African mainland including Orango N.P. in the Bijagos Archipelago off the coast of Guinea-Bissau (East 1999). The only sub-Saharan country from which Bushbuk has not recently been recorded, and where they may formerly have occurred, is Lesotho (Lynch 1994).","The Bushbuck is hunted for food and for sport. The proportion of animals taken from the wild and from ranches is unknown.

Numbers are considered to be in decline in much of the range, as a result of hunting, overgrazing, and outbreaks of rinderpest. In some other areas, bush encroachment has increased the amount of suitable habitat, and local range expansion and population increases have been reported. Nevertheless, the level of decline is suspected to have reached at least 20% over a period of 13 years (three generations), so approaching the threshold for Vulnerable under criterion A2cde. The Lesser Kudu will probably persist in the arid scrublands of northeastern Africa, as long as human and livestock densities remain relatively low in extensive parts of its range such as northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. It nevertheless faces a continuing, long-term population decline as meat hunting and pastoralism increase within its remaining range. Its status may eventually decline to threatened.","The Lesser Kudu is closely associated with <em>Acacia-Commiphora</em> thornbush in semi-arid areas of north-eastern Africa; it generally avoids open spaces and long grass (East 1999, Leuthold 2013). They are largely confined to lowland areas up to 1,200 m (Stewart and Stewart 1963) but have been recorded at about 1,740 m near Mt Kilimanjaro (Grimshaw <em>et al.</em> 1995). The Lesser Kudu is primarily a browser, consuming mainly leaves of trees, shrubs and herbs (Leuthold 2013).","Its shyness and preference for thick cover enable it to withstand considerable hunting pressure, e.g., it is relatively plentiful throughout the Ogaden region wherever there is sufficient dense bush, despite widespread, uncontrolled hunting by local people (East 1999). On the other hand, its susceptibility to rinderpest resulted in a substantial decrease in its numbers in eastern regions of Kenya during the mid-1990s. These populations can be expected to recover following the subsidence of this rinderpest outbreak. There are relatively few parts of the Lesser Kudu’s range where protection against poaching reaches moderate levels or better, and eradication of rinderpest from cattle would be a major step towards reducing current pressures on its populations (East 1999).","Citing various authors, East (1999) indicated that population estimates based on recent aerial surveys are available for considerable areas of the Lesser Kudu’s range, but aerial surveys substantially underestimate this species’ true numbers. In addition, its populations are unknown in the remainder of its range.

However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
121707666,12519,Lynx lynx,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Listed as Least Concern given its wide range and stable populations in the north of Europe and in large parts of its range in Asia (Bao 2010, Bersenev <em>et al. </em>2011, Kaczensky&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). A recent assessment of the status of Eurasian Lynx (hereafter just Lynx) in Europe shows that some isolated subpopulations remain Critically Endangered or Endangered (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2012).</p>","The Eurasian Lynx occurs in a wide variety of environmental and climatic conditions (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2011). Throughout Europe and Siberia, it is primarily associated with forested areas which have good ungulate populations and which provide enough cover fur hunting. It inhabits extended, Temperate and Boreal forests from the Atlantic in Western Europe to the Pacific coast in the Russian Far East (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>In Europe it can be found in Mediterranean forests up to the transition zone of taiga to tundra and lives from sea level up to the tree line (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008).<br/><br/>In Central Asia, Lynx occur in more open, thinly wooded areas and steppe habitats. The species probably occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the tree line (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003, Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Lynx occur sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau, and are found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Armenia Lynx are strongly associated with true forests and arid sparse forests and to a lesser extent with subalpine meadows. Lynx have been observed up to 5,500 m (Guggisberg 1975).<br/><br/>The Eurasian Lynx is the largest lynx, and the only one to primarily take ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller species where ungulates are less abundant. Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smaller ungulate species, such as Roe Deer, Chamois, Reindeer and Musk Deer. Occasionally, Lynx also hunt foxes, hares, marmots, wild pigs, beavers, birds or domestic animals such as sheep and goats, or, in Scandinavia, semi-domestic reindeer. In European Russia and western Siberia, where Roe Deer are absent, Mountain Hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base. Hares and birds are important prey also in other Central Asian regions where habitats are dryer and less forested (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).<br/><br/>Home range size varies widely from 100 to over 1,000 km² (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Home ranges averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland’s Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 1997). Average home range sizes in Switzerland were 90 km² for females and 150 km² for male Lynx. Male home ranges generally enclose 1-2 female territories (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Densities are typically 1-3 adults per 100 km², although higher densities of up to 5/100 km² have been reported from Eastern Europe and parts of Russia and lower densities of 0.3/100 km² from Scandinavia (Jedrzejewski <em>et al</em>. 1996, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sunde <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Saihanwula nature reserve in Inner Mongolia the density was estimated at 1.7-2.1/100 km² by camera trapping and track survey (Bao <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Turkey, a density of 4.2/100 km² has been estimated for the Ciglikara Nature Reserve, Antalya. However, this high Lynx density may be temporarily and may decline with major prey (hare) fluctuation (Avgan <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p></p>","The major threats to Lynx in Europe are low acceptance due to conflicts with hunters (and in northern Europe also with livestock farmers), persecution, habitat loss and fragmentation mainly due to infrastructure development, poor management structures and accidental mortality (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the Jura Mountains human related mortalities (traffic accidents, poaching) were responsible for 70 % of the known losses (Breitenmoser-Würsten <em>et al</em>. 2007). There are also concerns in regard of the low genetic diversity and small population sizes shown in some of the populations (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff 2003, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sindicic <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx is mainly threatened by poaching, loss of prey base and habitat degradation (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Asia the major threats are habitat fragmentation and loss mainly due to livestock farming, infrastructure development, resource extraction and logging activities, and poaching, mainly as retaliatory killing due to livestock depredation or for the fur trade (Kretser <em>et al</em>. 2012, Mousavi <em>et al</em>. 2014). In areas where livestock is the primary livelihood source, the conflict is even enhanced. Other threats include accidental mortality through trapping or dogs and human disturbance (Bao 2010). In Russia the Lynx is still important for the skin market and the pelt industry. In Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Pakistan prey base depletion due to poaching is considered a major threat (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ud Din and Nawaz 2010). In Turkey and Nepal low population size is assumed to be problematic.<br/><br/>Poor management structures and insufficient law enforcement and the lack of capacity and funding facilitate poaching and lead to higher habitat fragmentation, aggravating the situation of the Lynx (Shkvyria 2012).","The European Lynx population (excluding Russia and Belarus) has been estimated at 9,000-10,000. In Europe, the Lynx is divided into ten distinct subpopulations which are: Alpine, Balkan, Baltic, Bohemian-Bavarian, Carpathian, Dinaric, Jura, Karelian, Scandinavian and Vosges Palatinian (Kaczensky<em> et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Most Lynx populations in Europe are generally stable. However, status and trend varies greatly within the European range (Kaczensky<em> et al</em>. 2012, Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Balkan and the Vosges-Palatinian subpopulations have decreased and the Jura and the Scandinavian ones have increased (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). The autochthonous populations in north and east Europe (Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic and Carpathian) number each around 2,000 individuals. All the re-introduced populations are of small size (less than 200 or even less than 100 animals) and are classified as Endangered (Alpine, Dinaric and Jura subpopulation) or Critically Endangered (Bohemian-Bavarian, Vosges-Palatinian subpopulation) (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). The European population with the greatest conservation concern is the Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx subpopulation estimated at only 40-50 individuals (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013, Melovski 2012). In the Ukraine the Lynx is considered to be decreasing (Bashta and Dykyy 2013, Shkvyria and Shevchenko 2009).&#160; Its population in the Carpathian region has been estimated at 350-400 and the one in the Polysya region in the north of the country at 80-100 animals. Detailed status and trend information on European subpopulations can be found on <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm</a>.<br/><br/>Although a large portion of the Lynx’s range is in Asia, status and trend in many countries are poorly understood due to insufficient data. The following information has been gathered through a questionnaire sent to range country representatives (see supplementary material). In Russia the Lynx is thought to be stable in some regions and to be decreasing in others (Bersenev <em>et al</em>. 2011). The Russian Lynx population has been estimated at around 22,510 individuals in 2013 (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl)). The numbers are based on different methods in different regions, but mainly on winter tracking plus expert corrections. More accurate censuses are performed in regions with lower lynx densities than in areas where they are abundant. Lynx has been estimated to number 1,940 in the Central region, 4,110 in North-western region, 680 in the Northern Caucasus, 40 in the Southern region, 2,400 in the Volga region, 1,070 in the Ural, 6,390 in the Siberian region&#160; and 5,890 in the Russian Far East for 2013 (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl) and with help of V.V. Rozhnov 2014). In Mongolia the Lynx population was estimated at around 10,000 (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). The Lynx population in China has been estimated at around 27,000 by the State Forestry Administration in 2009 and is listed as Vulnerable (Wang 1998, Bao 2010). Its population and range is thought to be increasing in Inner Mongolia.<br/><br/>In Afghanistan the presence of the Lynx has been confirmed by camera trap surveys in the Wakhan District of Badakhshan and in the Northern Plateau, Yakawlang District of Bamyan provinces, since 2006. In Armenia the lynx is thought to be a common species, especially in some protected areas but the population trend is unknown. In Azerbaijan Lynx populations are thought to be stable in the Talysh Mountains, Zangezur Ridge and the foothills of the Greater Caucasus, and in arid and semi-arid landscapes around the Mingechaur Water Reservoir. In Bhutan the lynx is thought to occur in the Jigme Dorji National Park and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, however, no concrete evidence exists (Wangchuck <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Lynx is proposed as Vulnerable in Iran (Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Iraq, except a Lynx sighting in 2006 in Darbandikhan and the first confirmed record of Eurasian Lynx in 2011 from the Barzan area, there are no recent observations (Barzani 2013). The population in Kyrgyzstan is thought to be stable but not very high and classified as Near Threatened (Sludsky 1978). The Lynx is thought to be decreasing in Nepal and classified as Vulnarable (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2011), but there is no hard evidence. The only indication for its presence comes from the northwestern district of Humla, from the Dhorpatan hunting reserve and upper Mustand area in the Annapurna conservation area in 1996 (Fox 1985). Jnawali <em>et al</em>. (2011) maps the distribution of the lynx additionally in the Rara National Park and Shey-Phoksundo National Park. The Lynx might be declining in Pakistan and its long-term survival is not assured, although it is listed as Least Concern (Sheikh and Molur 2004). In 2003 the Lynx population in northern Pakistan has been estimated at 80-120 animals and the permanently occupied area in the whole country at around 25,252 km² (Sheikh and Molur 2004). In Tajikistan the Lynx is considered as rare and is mainly found in the southern part of the country in the Darvaz range, westernmost part of the Pamir Mountains, the Ghunda valley and the Wakhan valley. In Uzbekistan, the Lynx is considered Vulnerable and thought to be decreasing but seems to be stable in the Gissar Nature Reserve, with an estimated population of 130 in 2013.",Stable,"<p>The Eurasian Lynx has a very broad distribution. It occurs along forested mountain ranges in southeastern and Central Europe and from northern and eastern Europe through the Boreal forests of Russia, down into Central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Kaczensky <em>et al.</em> 2012, Nowell and Jackson 1996,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The Lynx's stronghold is a broad strip of southern Siberian woodland stretching from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). Subpopulations in the southeast of its range (Europe and southwest Asia) are generally small and widely separated, whereas the bulk of its historic range from Scandinavia through Russia and Central Asia is largely intact.<br/> <br/> In Europe, it was probably absent from some of the larger islands such as Ireland and Sicily and from countries with few forests. It was also absent from the Iberian Peninsula, where the smaller Iberian Lynx<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>Lynx pardinus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;occurs. Lynx have been extirpated from most of Western and Central Europe with the exception of the Carpathian Mountains. It survived in a small area in the Balkans (Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro). Larger populations persisted in Fennoscandia, the Baltic States, and European Russia. Lynx have been released in several countries of Europe in an effort to bring back this elusive predator, including in Switzerland, Slovenia, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and France (IUCN 2007).</span></p>",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II and protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix III). The Lynx is protected and hunting prohibited in Afghanistan, Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In Sweden, Finland and Romania the lynx is protected but a limited number of Lynx can be killed under derogation. In Estonia and Norway the lynx is listed as a game species with an open hunting season and in Latvia Lynx can be exploited to a limited extent by sports hunting (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Lynx is also subject to hunting in Iraq and Russia. In Russia, the Lynx is only hunted in places where it is abundant as in some areas of the Central region and the Volga region, in most areas of the North-Western region, the Ural, the Sibirian region and the Russian Far East. Hunting is not allowed in the Northern Caucasus and in the Southern region. The Lynx is not protected in Armenia.<br/><br/>Since 2006, a programme for the recovery of the Balkan Lynx is being implemented and range wide conservation strategies were developed (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). In several European range states, prevention measures to counteract livestock depredation are in place and awareness has increased but measures for managing conflicts with hunters are still missing (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>There is a need for improved monitoring activities in the Carpathian and Dinaric Lynx populations in Europe and many parts of Asia (a.o. Ud Din and Nawaz 2010, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2012). Connectivity between small isolated European lynx populations should be enhanced to allow gene flow and prevent inbreeding depression (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer Ruff 2003). In Italy and Austria a reinforcement project has started to address the threat of genetic deterioration due to low population size and lacking connectivity by translocating Lynx. Detailed recommendations for the conservation of the European subpopulations are given in <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm</a>.<br/><br/>Genetic monitoring is also needed in parts of Asia to detect the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the Lynx (Bao 2010).<br/><br/>In some parts of its range awareness for the species was enhanced as for example in Iraq, where stakeholders, students and social media were engaged to stop illegal hunting or as in Afghanistan, where public awareness has been raised among local communities, particularly in Badakhsahn and Bamyan Provinces, wildlife laws have been enforced in some areas and the Border Police and Customs office in certain parts of the country have been trained to control fur trade. In China the patrolling by local police was strengthened and a nature reserve network was established to expand suitable Lynx habitat. In Iran a preliminary status assessment of the lynx was conducted from 2006-2009 and a country wide status assessment in 2010-2012 (Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010, Mousavi <em>et al</em>. in press). In Pakistan measures specific for carnivore conservation have been introduced which benefit also the Lynx. In 2010 a project focusing on lynx research and conservation education has been implemented and the protected area network has been increased. In Tajikistan measures adopted to reduce conflicts with Snow Leopards are working for Lynx as well.<br/><br/>From most range states there is only sparse information on the lynx available. Data on population trend is mainly missing. There is a need for management improvement, better monitoring and more research on Lynx ecology and distribution in Asia to increase the knowledge on the population status and trend, as well as on threats and conservation needs (Moqanaki <em>et al</em>. 2010, Bao 2010).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
121745669,712,Ailuropoda melanoleuca,Vulnerable,C2a(i); D1,2016,2016-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) produced an estimated range-wide population of 1,864 Giant Pandas, excluding dependent young &lt;1.5 years of age (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although no formal demographic analysis is available, there are demographic data available to enable estimation of age-related population composition (Sichuan Forestry Department 2015): if the population consists of 9.6% cubs, then the total population of Pandas is approximately 2,060. Mature adults are estimated to compose 50.5% of the total population, yielding an estimate of 1,040. Although this estimate does not contain confidence intervals, clearly the lower confidence interval would fall below 1,000 mature individuals, which meets the small population size criteria (D1) for Vulnerable.<br/><br/>Additionally, the species falls under criteria C2. The Panda population is fragmented into subpopulations, each of which contains &lt;1,000 adults (given that the total population is &lt;1,000 adults); however, the size of the largest population is unknown given uncertainty in how much connectivity remains. It appears that at least one distinct populations in the Minshan mountains contains &gt;400 mature individuals (State Forestry Administration 2015), so the species does not meet the criteria for Endangered (EN). The most tentative part of listing under C2 is a continued population decline.<br/><br/>Evidence from a series of range-wide national surveys indicate that the previous population decline has been arrested, and the population has started to increase (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although inconsistencies in data collection methods, analysis, and sampling area make direct comparisons from survey results difficult, population estimates have consistently increased across survey since the Second National Survey conducted during 1985-1988. Initial uncertainties regarding whether modest population increases observed in the Third National Survey (2000-2004) were real warranted maintaining the Endangered status for the Giant Panda in the previous Red List assessment. Recent data from the Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) remove this uncertainty (State Forestry Administration 2015), and it is widely believed that the population has stabilized and has begun to increase in many parts of the range.<br/><br/>An increase in available habitat and an expanding occupied range provide further support for the contention that Panda numbers are increasing. Forest protection and reforestation measures have increased forest cover in China (FAO 2010), and have supported an 11.8% increase in occupied habitat and 6.3% increase in unoccupied but suitable habitat between the Third and Fourth National Surveys (State Forestry Administration 2015). A survey of expert opinion among Giant Panda experts in the IUCN Bear Specialist Group was consistent with the results of the national survey: all believed that the Panda population was stable or increasing and that available habitat was increasing.<br/><br/>Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate &gt;35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Under this scenario, the species fits the criteria for VU under C2a(i).<br/><br/>Whereas the decision to downlist the Giant Panda to Vulnerable is a positive sign confirming that the Chinese government's efforts to conserve this species are effective, it is critically important that these protective measures are continued and that emerging threats are addressed. The threat of declining bamboo availability due to climate change could, in the near future, reverse the gains made during the last two decades. The Giant Panda will remain a conservation-dependent species for the foreseeable future. The Chinese government's plan to expand existing conservation policy for the species (State Forestry Administration 2015) should receive strong support to ensure its implementation.","A member of the order Carnivora, Giant Pandas have evolved to specialize on a diet of bamboo (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Bamboo is a poor food source, low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, and wild Giant Pandas can only digest an average of 17% of dry matter and about 27% of hemi-cellulose (Dierenfeld <em>et al.</em> 1982, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1985). Thus, to meet their daily energy requirement, Giant Pandas must consume a large amount of bamboo, up to 12.5 kg per day, and defecate more than 100 times daily (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Pandas have large, muscular jaws with skeletal features to accommodate the musculature and its famous “pseudothumb” used to hold and manipulate bamboo for processing. However, compared with other herbivores, the Panda has very low digestive efficiency because its digestive tract still resembles that of its carnivorous ancestors. The Panda’s feeding strategy emphasizes volume, requiring it to allocate much of its time to foraging (approximately 14 hours daily).<br/><br/>While morphological and behavioural adaptations provide some compensation for poor digestive efficiency, the Panda’s ability to survive on such a low-quality food source remained mysterious for decades. Even whole-genome sequencing found no specific genes responsible for the digestion of cellulose and hemi-cellulose (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010). An explanation was uncovered in a recent metagenomics study that found the Panda’s gut microbes play an important role in digesting bamboo fibers (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Additional adaptations to poor quality diet are found in the Panda’s extreme strategy of energy conservation, with daily energy expenditure comparable to that of a sloth or reptile (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Pandas demonstrate a suite of adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. The thick pelage conserves energy lost through body heat, and it has long been known that pandas are conservative in movement and physical activity. Smaller than expected organs also are indicative of energy-conservation adaptation, and down-regulation of resting metabolic rate has been achieved through a mutation in the synthesis pathway for thyroid hormones.<br/><br/>Giant Pandas also compensate for digestive inefficiency by selecting the most nutritious parts of bamboo plants and by altering diet selection seasonally commensurate with changes in nutritional profiles of bamboo species (Schaller<em> et al.</em> 1985, Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015b). They demonstrate strong preference for seasonally available new bamboo shoots, rich in nutrition and energy and low in fibre. Outside the late spring bamboo shoot season, Pandas favour leaves, although more stems are incorporated into their diet during the winter months when leaf quality and quantity diminishes. This convergence of foraging strategies across variations in climate, bamboo species, and topographic profile indicates an adaptive strategy that serves the species well. Still, as an energy-limited species that spends more than 50% of its time foraging, Panda numbers may be limited by the availability of high quality bamboo and the time required to process bamboo in the digestive system.<br/><br/>Early coarse-scale radio tracking using VHF transmitters provided foundational data on home range size and documented the solitary nature of the Panda’s existence (Schaller<em> et al</em>. 1985, Yong <em>et al. </em>1994, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). Although Panda home ranges overlap generously, direct encounters between individuals are rare. Seasonal elevational migration has been documented in the Qionglai (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985) and Qinling mountains (Yong <em>et al.</em> 1994, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). At both sites, the seasonal movements track changes in resources, providing access to bamboo species that provide greater nutritional value. Research integrating behavioural, nutritional, and movement data provide new insights into these seasonal migration patterns, demonstrating that these movements facilitate consumption of higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of key nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca) (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014). Female-biased dispersal has been demonstrated with genetic data in the Minshan and Liangshan Mountains (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hu <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Fine-scale documentation of |Panda movement behaviour had to await the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Published accounts using high-resolution GPS telemetry revised and added to previous findings (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hull <em>et al. </em>2015). VHF-based radio tracking inevitably leads to large amounts of missing data when animals at more distant locations are not detected, thus it is unsurprising that GPS tracking substantively revised home range size upwards, and that core area overlap and opportunity for social interactions is now understood to be greater than previously believed. Other interesting phenomena were also detected, such as the documentation of female-biased dispersal (confirmed with genetic data; Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007), and sudden, large movements that temporarily took a female far outside of her home range during the mating season. Fine-scale movement data showed that Pandas exhibited individualistic and multiphasic movement paths within seasonal core habitats and large-scale movements between habitats. Tortuous movement paths indicated when pandas searched for and found foraging resources. Pandas frequently return to the same foraging patches, indicating that they likely have well-developed spatial memory.<br/><br/>Using various measures of habitat suitability, efforts to map Panda habitat have proven valuable for guiding the establishment of the Panda reserve system (Shen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Feng <em>et al.</em> 2009, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant Pandas typically occupy temperate montane forests at altitudes of 1,500–3,000 m (Hu and Wei 2004). Range-wide analysis of ecological covariates associated with Panda presence suggested that Giant Pandas are associated with old growth forests, a finding previously unrecognised in studies implemented on smaller spatial scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). As an obligate bamboo specialist, the Giant Panda’s reliance on this resource is clear, yet it has usually been ignored in habitat suitability models because mapping bamboo understory using remote sensing techniques is difficult (Linderman<em> et al. </em>2005). Including understory bamboo in habitat models dramatically decreases estimates of available habitat and increases measures of fragmentation. Advances in remote sensing techniques, such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), combined with new analytical techniques, such as artificial neural network analysis, have helped remove obstacles to including bamboo understory in maps of habitat suitability (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2009; Viña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Enhanced understanding of Panda habitat requirements and improvements in mapping technologies provide managers and policy makers with better tools for conservation decision-making (Loucks <em>et al.</em> 2003, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Qi <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Giant Pandas are a solitary and seasonal-breeding mammal, only coming together during the breeding season, from March to May, for reproductive purposes (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Male Pandas occupy large home ranges overlapping several females and are known to congregate around oestrous females. Male Pandas are able to locate females across large areas, and demonstrate fierce and injurious aggression in competition for access to females. Early in these encounters escalated aggression is common, but, in a possible strategy to conserve energy and minimize risk of injury, once dominance is established, contact aggression is largely replaced with non-contact aggression. Individual males are able to locate and mate with multiple females sequentially, so the mating system might be considered scramble competition polygyny.<br/><br/>Because Pandas live a solitary existence, they must rely heavily on chemosignals to communicate with one another without necessitating face-to-face encounters. Giant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations that provide them with reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other Pandas (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985). Studies documenting habitat characteristics of preferred marking sites, including tree species and microhabitat (Nie <em>et al. </em>2012a), extend our understanding of habitat requirements for the species. If habitat that promotes communication is not maintained, then poor communication may hinder breeding in the wild, as has been shown for captive Pandas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Denning ecology is an important field of study among ursids, and other species giving birth in dens, because access to adequate dens can be important for offspring survival. Forest management practices that affect the availability of suitable dens can either significantly harm or enhance cub survival (White<em> et al. </em>2001). Ursid young, being extremely altricial, are particularly vulnerable. The Giant Panda lies at the extreme end of this continuum, with the mother weighing nearly 1,000 times the cub’s weight at birth (Gittleman 1994). Den quality may therefore be critical for Pandas. Giant Pandas do not hibernate, but females use rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every 2–3 years (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2001). Preferred dens are characterized by a small opening to buffer against the elements and provide a warmer and drier environment for rearing offspring (Zhang<em> et al. </em>2007). Dens tend to be located close to water, presumably so the mother can leave the vulnerable cub (almost always a single cub) unattended for a shorter period of time while she drinks. It has also been proposed that tree dens, once more numerous in primary forests before logging converted many forests in Panda habitat to second growth, are a limiting resource for Giant Pandas (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). The importance of this resource may explain why national survey data indicate that pandas are more often found in primary than secondary forest.<br/><br/>It was once believed, and sometimes still mis-stated, that Pandas’ biological deficiencies were responsible for their own decline. Because of early problems with captive breeding, Pandas gained a reputation for having notoriously low levels of interest in mating; however, Pandas in the wild experience no mating problems and have high reproductive rates (Wei and Hu 1994, Pan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Once a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of the species was incorporated into husbandry practices, captive Pandas began to mate naturally and experienced exponential population growth (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2006, Zhang and Wei 2006, Martin-Wintle <em>et al.</em> 2016). Moreover, its well-known specialization on bamboo is not (as once thought) an evolutionary cul de sac, as it opens up a foraging niche with plentiful resources and few competitors (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dietary specialization is often seen as an extinction risk factor, but this may not be the case for the Panda, which specializes on widespread and abundant bamboo. Thus, pandas are well-adapted to their environment and have reproductive rates sufficiently high to explain the recovery of populations once bans on poaching and habitat restoration efforts commenced (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The primary threat facing Giant Panda populations is the continuing effects of previous habitat loss, resulting in highly fragmented habitat and, in many cases small, isolated populations. According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>Although microsatellite analysis (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Shan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and genomics (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.<br/><br/>Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin <em>et al.</em> 2010; Zhang, L. <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.<br/><br/>Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li <em>et al.</em> 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species.","The Giant Panda is the subject of one of the largest, most intensive efforts to estimate population size for an entire species. The Chinese government has carried out four national surveys, approximately every 10 years since 1974. The most recent, the Fourth National Survey conducted from 2011 to 2014, mobilized more than 2,000 people who spent more than 60,000 person-days surveying 4.36 million ha. The population estimates derived from these surveys should be considered rough estimates due to difficulty associated with extrapolating sign survey data to determine the number of individuals. Idiosyncratic feeding styles among individual pandas produce bamboo fragments that vary somewhat distinctively in size (“bite-size”) between individuals and thus provide some information that helps distinguish faeces from different individuals, especially when combined with information about home range size. However, as a population census tool, this method has never been fully validated (Pan<em> et al. </em>2014). Evidence suggests that sign survey data may have under-estimated population size in one reserve (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wei <em>et al. </em>2012), but it is not known to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other reserves. Although DNA has been extracted from faeces collected during the Fourth National Survey, these data have not yet yielded a population estimate because most of the faeces collected were not sufficiently fresh to provide adequate DNA. Thus, the best available population estimate for the species relies on bite-size analysis.<br/><br/>Another limitation of the national survey data is that the methods have been altered and improved since they commenced in 1974, and the range and effort of the survey have been inconsistent. The same methods were used for the third and fourth national surveys; although survey effort increased in the fourth survey, most of this increase can be attributed to the larger area covered to capture the expanding range that Pandas now occupy. Thus, comparisons between surveys may not be completely valid, but they are still informative. The first survey (1974–1977) produced an estimate of 2,459 pandas, which decreased dramatically in the second survey (1985–1988) to 1,216 individuals. This approximately 50% drop in population size provided the impetus for the 1988 Wildlife Protection act, which banned Panda poaching, and China’s <em>National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat</em>, which established a reserve system for Pandas (Reid and Gong 1999). By the time of the third survey (2000–2004), the population estimate increased to 1,596, indicating that these protective measures may have been successful. However, uncertainties remained due to the inconsistencies in the methods by which the surveys were implemented (as well as a lack of confidence limits on the point estimates). Although these same limitations still apply, the recent fourth survey showed the Panda population increased further to 1,864, removing most remaining uncertainties regarding population trend. Additionally, Pandas have been documented in many areas outside their known range, including an animal shot in 2015 in Yunnan Province, where they have not been recorded for centuries. An increasing population was not surprising, given that available and occupied habitats have increased. <br/><br/>The optimism engendered by these positive trends is dampened by evidence indicating that some Panda populations are decreasing, particularly those found in the smallest and most degraded habitat patches such as Liangshan, Xiangling and Niuweihe. Approximately 223 pandas occupying 23 isolated habitat patches are considered at high risk of local extinction, and will require increased protection and management (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011b; State Forestry Administration 2015).",Increasing,"Once widespread throughout southern China, and as far north as Beijing and south into Southeast Asia, the Panda’s distribution is now confined to its previous western extremity in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Pleistocene range shifts were associated with the disappearance of the Panda’s principal source of food, bamboo, due to warming climate; whereas rapid range contraction in the past several hundred years is attributed to the conversion of bamboo forests to agricultural cultivation and rapid expansion of human populations (Li <em>et al.</em> 2015). The largest populations are currently found in the Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai mountain ranges, and smaller, more isolated populations remain in the Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiangling mountain ranges (State Forestry Administration 2015).<br/><br/>The Giant Panda’s range is highly fragmented, resulting from centuries of human encroachment and loss of forested habitat at lower elevations. Rapidly expanding industrialization, beginning in the early 1900s and accelerating since 1949, is associated with severe contraction of the Panda’s range (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li<em> et al. </em>2015). While they once occupied forests below 1,000 m in elevation, current populations are restricted to mountain ranges, separated by valleys and flatter landscapes that have been altered by human activities. China lost more than 30% of its forests between 1950 and 2004, coinciding with a precipitous drop in Panda populations, but forest cover has increased in the past two decades (FAO 2010).","Although historically the Giant Panda was sometimes hunted for its pelt, law enforcement mechanisms appear to have eliminated this trade.",Terrestrial,"The Giant Panda has been the focus of one of the most intensive, high profile efforts to recover an endangered species. In 1981, China joined the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which made trade of Panda skins illegal. Enactment of the 1988 Wildlife Protection Law banned poaching and conferred protected status to the Giant Panda (listed as Category I, the highest level of protection). The National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat of 1992 laid out a masterplan for Panda conservation and established a Panda reserve system, which today has grown to 67 reserves. Enlarged by more than 50% since the Third National Survey, this reserve system currently protects 67% of the Panda population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of Panda habitat (State Forestry Administration 2015). The biological diversity of these reserves is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems (Mackinnon 2008), thus making the Panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other sympatric species (Noss 1990).<br/><br/>These efforts to end poaching and protect Panda habitat played a significant role in Panda recovery. The Chinese government also invested in infrastructure and capacity building for reserve staff, established anti-poaching patrol, curtailed human activities inside reserves, and in some cases relocated human settlements from inside to outside of reserves. Other measures directed at broader conservation problems also benefited the Panda. The Natural Forest Conservation Program was implemented in 1997 to reduce the devastating impacts of flooding on human communities due to deforestation and erosion. The program banned logging in most forests in Panda habitat, slowing habitat degradation. Additionally, the Grain-to-Green Program incentivized farmers to plant trees on steep slopes to slow erosion. The result of these policies was the addition of 3 million hectares of forest cover in China annually, an increase of 1.6% per year from 2000 to 2010 (FAO 2010). As a consequence, Panda habitat is recovering and the total occupied habitat has increased by 11.8% between the Third and the Fourth National Surveys; an additional 6.3% increase in suitable but unoccupied habitat was also observed. In the Wolong Nature Reserve, implementation of the Grain-to-Green Program brought about measurable increases in connectivity of Panda habitat (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007). Thus, these habitat conservation policies are associated with increasing Panda population size, increasing range, and better habitat connectivity. Efforts have also commenced to restore habitat corridors (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a) and to reintroduce captive-born pandas to increase genetic diversity in small, isolated populations.<br/><br/>Ecocompensation has been proposed as an important component of a conservation strategy for pandas (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2015; Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 15% of the remaining unprotected habitat occurs in collectively-owned forests. Payment for ecosystem services, which has already been shown to benefit Panda conservation under the Grain-to-Green Program, could extend conservation measures into these unprotected areas.<br/><br/>Finally, the Giant Panda has been the beneficiary of a massive scientific effort conducted in partnerships between the Chinese government and institutions and international conservation NGOs and zoos (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a, State Forestry Administration 2015). Once poorly understood, there has been an explosion of scientific studies across many disciplines, and this knowledge has increasingly been applied management and policy decisions. Future directions would benefit from even better coordination between science and policy, and the application of adaptive management principles in which experiments are conducted to evaluate management actions that may increase carrying capacity inside protected areas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a).<br/><br/>China's State Forestry Administration, while rightfully proud of its accomplishments, fully realizes that more work needs to be done to further Panda conservation and to avoid losing ground so painstakingly gained. They plant to continue investing in habitat protection, population monitoring, and protection patrols, and to further develop capacity of reserve staff (State Forestry Administration 2015). They recognize the challenges the future holds, and in particular will seek to address problems of habitat connectivity and population fragmentation.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
123789863,2815,Bison bison,Near Threatened,C2a(i),2017,2016-09-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is listed as Near Threatened in light of its dependence on ongoing conservation program to persist beyond the next 5 years, a very limited number of viable populations (five), and large number of small (13 of 20 less than 400) isolated populations. The North America bison population underwent a drastic decline in the 19th century caused by over hunting but has since partially recovered. There has been a modest increases in the number of conservation herds and individuals in populations managed for species conservation and ecological restoration, however, all mature individuals occur within active management programs which if ceased would result in the species qualifying for a threatened status. About 97% of the continental population is managed for private captive commercial propagation; very few of these herds are managed primarily for species conservation and none is managed in the public interest for conservation. Herds managed for conservation purposes in the public interest are typically small (&lt;400), and populations are widely dispersed with few geographic situations that provide conditions for natural movements between subpopulations. The total number of mature individuals in wild free-ranging and semi-free-ranging populations is estimated to be approximately 11,248-13,123 and only 4 subpopulations have more than 1,000 individuals, thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). The species is not currently in decline but wild mature individuals could be greatly reduced if current management regimes are changed or removed. This is a conservation dependant species.<br/> <br/> The current number of ecologically restored large populations managed primarily for conservation (populations exceeding 1,000 and managed in the presence of most natural limiting factors) is small. The species is most limited in Mexico, where only one herd may remain in the wild; it is subject to adverse policies when individuals move across the international border into the United States where they are classified as livestock. Creation of opportunities for a few additional, large-scale ecological restoration projects is dependent on cooperation between government agencies and non-government organizations. Future progress in conservation and recovery of the North American bison will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by federal and state/provincial agencies, harmonization of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organizations, and public tolerance and support of wild, free-ranging bison managed as wildife on limited, large-scale landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different agencies or organizations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">The likelihood of wild bison increasing over the next five years is entirely dependent upon conservation interventions.&#160;Currently six of the 20 wild herds representing 11,956 animals (63.7%) are anchored by National Parks, Refuges or Sanctuaries. Without these large protected landscapes bison would not likely survive and the future survival of American bison would be in serious jeopardy. Beyond these 6 herds in protected areas the remaining 14 wild herds are dependent upon conservation actions and management decisions by conservation programs of States, Tribes and Provinces who regulate the populations to assure sustainability of these herds.&#160;None of the 20 wild bison herds would persist without the management prescriptions and subsequent actions of the managing authorities.&#160;Wood bison are currently protected under the Species at Risk Act and are managed under a National Recovery Strategy.&#160;Hence, wild bison (wood or plains) are totally dependent upon conservation actions and protected lands.&#160;American Bison would not persist without those intensive conservation measures.</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">North American bison are primarily grazers and forage primarily in grassland and meadow vegetative communities. They had the widest natural range of any North American herbivore, from the arid grasslands of Chihuahua State in northern Mexico, through the grasslands of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, to the riparian meadows of interior Alaska. They can persist in arid regions (e.g. Mexico and New Mexico) and in areas experiencing deep snow cover (e.g., Yellowstone National Park). Grasses and sedges form the mainstay of the annual diet in all regions. However, summer and fall diets may be broader, including flowering plants, woody plant leaves, and lichens, in addition to grasses and sedges, depending on local availability. Bison excavate snow at foraging sites by sweeping it away using side to side motions of their muzzle. The plains bison undertook seasonal migrations when they were abundant prior to European settlement of the continent. Bison no longer migrate owing to land use change contributing to range restriction and depopulation. The Wood Bison was not migratory and remains so. Both subspecies exhibit strong seasonal aggregation during the calving through breeding seasons (May through August).</p>","In the 19th Century, market, subsistence and recreational hunting nearly eliminated the bison throughout its range in North America. Conservation measures have brought about limited recovery in the wild and in captive conservation herds. Private commercial production of bison has resulted in significant numerical recovery, but does not provide for conservation of the bison as wildlife in the sense used for Red List designation. Existing threats include: habitat loss; genetic manipulation of commercial bison for market traits; small population effects in most conservation herds; few herds are exposed to a full range of natural limiting factors (natural selection); cattle gene introgression; loss of genetic non-exchangeability through hybridization between bison subspecies; and the threat of depopulation as a management response to infection of some wild populations hosting reportable cattle diseases. Canada, the United States and Mexico list bison nationally as both wildlife and domestic livestock. Legal status varies among State and Provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, four provinces and two territories classify bison as both wildlife and livestock. Bison are legally classified as livestock in the United Sates only 10 states classify bison as wildlife in all or portions of the state. An additional threat to populations of this species is culling to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.","There are approximately 31,000 total bison in 68 conservation herds (herds managed in the public interest by governments and environmental organizations) in North America. These include about 20,000 Plains Bison and 11,000 total Wood Bison. For this assessment we applied a rigorous set of criteria to classify herds as functioning as wild, functioning as wild with limitations and not functioning as wild. We excluded from this assessment 30 of 68 conservation bison herds that are very small (&lt;300) and managed on small landscapes (&lt;10,000 acres) for education, public viewing and research. Based on our criteria these bison cannot function as wild bison under current management schemes. We also did not include 9,523 bison in 18 herds managed behind fences and held in captivity, although these are important conservation herds. These herds are considered captive, intensively husbanded and culled by artificial selection.<br/><br/>There are 14,703 bison in eight herds that are in populations &gt;400 and function as wild bison subject to the full range of natural selections forces. Another 4,044 wild bison are found in 12 herds that free-range but suffer from small populations size (&lt;400) and may experience limited predation from large carnivores. For this assessment we considered the wild bison population to be 18,748 bison from these 20 free-ranging herds occupying large landscapes and primarily subjected to the forces of natural selection. We conducted Population Viability Analyses (PVA) for the eight largest herds to determine both the demographic and genetic viability of each population and their viability if they were managed as a meta-population out to 200 years (see the attached PVA report).<br/><br/>The number of calves and yearlings in a bison population will vary considerably between populations and years (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2008). Therefore It is difficult to establish the exact number of mature individuals in each of 20 bison herds but demographic data from many show that 30-40% are individuals under 2 years of age. We estimated that there are between 11,248 and 13,123 mature bison in the current populations of wild free-ranging bison in North America.<br/><br/>Populations are considered viable in the long term if they exceed 1,000 individuals (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are two Plains Bison conservation herds and two Wood Bison conservation herds each exceeding 1,000 individuals—therefore according to this criteria the total number of viable populations is only four. However, a specific population viability analysis was performed on the eight bison herds functioning as wild and results demonstrate that all are demographically viable but all but the two largest herds will lose 5-8% of their genetic diversity over the next 200 years (see the PVA report in the Supplementary Material).",Stable,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The original North American range <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">for <em>Bison bison</em> extended from northern Mexico to Alaska. Plains Bison (<em>B. b. bison</em>) occurred from Northern Mexico to central Alberta, Canada. Wood Bison (<em>B. b. athabascae</em>) occurred from central Alberta, Canada to Alaska, USA. The species' current range is restricted by land use and wildlife management policies in the southern area and by wildlife and reportable disease management policies in the northern portion of the North American range.

Conservation practices vary widely among private owners and are not regulated. Escapes from private commercial herds have been documented in Montana, Alberta, and British Columbia. Artificial selection for market traits is a cause for concern: escaped individuals may become established in the wild or interbreed with established wild populations.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">A recovery program for wood bison has existed in Canada since the early 1960s where the subspecies was designated as 'Threatened' by the Committee on Endangered Species of Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). In May 2004 COSEWIC assessed the status of plains bison and recommended listing them as 'Threatened' in Canada. National Refuges and Parks and State parks play an important role in maintaining conservation herds in Canada and the United States. Wild free-ranging herds are managed by government agencies. The Nature Conservancy manages 13 captive herds and the American Prairie Reserve manages one fenced bison herd primarily for conservation objectives. Restoration of large populations of plains bison are being considered in Alberta, southern Colorado, Arizona and northern Montana. The State of Alaska recently reintroduced wood bison to the wild in the Yukon region. Better coordination among various federal initiatives for plains bison conservation is being accomplished by a designated Department of Interior Bison Working Group commissioned by secretarial order in 2008. A Plains Bison reintroduction is scheduled for Banff National Park in spring 2017.<br/> <br/> The Bison Specialist Group (North America) produced a bison conservation assessment and action plan that provides support and guidance for policy development and conservation planning and management for public and private sector projects, including: numeric, geographic and genetic status of North American bison, including public and private herds; a review of legislation and policies of individual range states regarding bison conservation; geographic assessment of priority conservation areas in North America (Gates <em>et al</em>. 2010); enhancing the capacity of members of the Bison Specialist Group and organizations they represent to provide timely, innovative and practical solutions to conservation challenges; guidelines for management in support of species’ conservation and ecological restoration. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are potential opportunities for ecological restoration of herds managed primarily for conservation on federal, state, provincial lands in some jurisdictions (Sanderson <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al.</em><span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, Freese <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recently the U.S. Department of Interior published a document titled “looking forward” where they enumerated potential restoration sites in the United States (National Park Service 2014a). In addition the U.S. National Park Service has identified bison restoration as a key activity in their plan for the next 100 years.

136266699,9194,Giraffa camelopardalis,Vulnerable,A2acd,2018,2016-07-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2 due to an observed, past (and ongoing) population decline of 36-40% over three generations (30 years, 1985-2015). The factors causing this decline (levels of exploitation and decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality) have not ceased and may not be reversible throughout the species’ range. The best available estimates indicate a total population in 1985 of 151,702-163,452 Giraffes (106,191-114,416 mature individuals), and in 2015 a total population of 97,562 Giraffes (68,293 mature individuals). Historically the species has been overlooked in terms of research and conservation, but in the past five years, considerable progress has been made in compiling and producing a species-wide assessment of population size and distribution by the members of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group. Some Giraffe populations are stable or increasing, while others are declining, and each population is subject to pressure by threats specific to their local country or region. The populations of Giraffes are scattered and fragmented with different growth trajectories and threats, but the species trend reveals an overall large decline in numbers across their range in Africa.","About one million years ago, multiple ungulate species, including at least three Giraffe species, spread over the African continent along with the emerging savanna/woodland biome (Mitchell and Skinner 2003, Robinson 2011). But between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, only a single species, <em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>, is found in the fossil record. The adaptive radiation of Giraffes across Africa occurred during a period of environmental instability, climate change, and geological upheavals that produced distinctive lineages living in mostly disconnected areas of Africa (Bock <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Fennessy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Groves and Grubb 2011, Brown <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Hassanin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Continued natural, as well as human-induced, changes in habitat have yielded a suture zone in Eastern Africa, as well as possibly Northern and Southern Africa, that impedes our ability to mark specific boundaries between the various kinds of Giraffes. Hence, Giraffes evolved an ability to adapt to a variety of ecosystems and, as they did so, lineages emerged in different regions where they evolved distinctive characteristics, but whether these traits are significant enough to consider the differences as species or subspecies is unclear at the moment.<br/><br/>Giraffes are most often found in savanna/woodland habitats, but range widely throughout Africa. They are browsers that subsist on a variable diet that includes leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. They do not need to drink on a daily basis. Across the continent, detailed records of Giraffe feeding ecology have noted that each population has a very diverse diet of up to 93 different species, but that usually a half dozen plant species comprise at least 75% of the diet. <em>Acacia</em> is fed on in high proportions wherever Giraffes are found, but during the dry season, the preferred plant species varies by location. <em>Faidherbia, Boscia, Grewia</em>, and <em>Kigelia</em> have all been identified as the most common plant species in the diet of giraffes in the dry season in different locations. Some populations have seasonal shifts in home ranges.","Four major threats to Giraffes can be identified, although the severity and presence of these threats varies by region and population: (1) habitat loss (through deforestation, land use conversion, expansion of agricultural activities and human population growth) (2) civil unrest (ethnic violence, rebel militias, paramilitary and military operations), (3) illegal hunting (poaching), and (4) ecological changes (mining activity, habitat conversion to agriculture, climate-induced processes). In Southern Africa, the main perceived threats are habitat loss and conversion of land for human development, and illegal hunting. In West Africa, the main threats are habitat loss due to increasing human populations and human-wildlife conflict. In Eastern and Central Africa the main threats are habitat loss through rapid conversion of land for farming and increasing human populations, drought, illegal hunting for meat and hide, and armed conflict throughout unstable regions.<br/><br/>Some of the highest human fertility rates in the world (&gt;4%) occur in countries where Giraffes are present. Natural habitat changes from weather irregularities result in situations generating human movement, sometimes into protected, or semi-protected, areas. Drought conditions have become more common and increase the prospects of bush fires, loss of habitat, and human population movements. Substantial human population migration also characterizes regions and areas with military operations in giraffe habitats. In some countries (e.g., Namibia, South Africa) the hunting of Giraffes is legal, but Giraffe population sizes there are increasing; in other countries (e.g., Tanzania) the poaching of Giraffes is associated with declines in Giraffe population size. Habitat fragmentation and degradation are probably the most widespread and greatest threats to African wildlife, including Giraffes, often arising as a consequence of mineral extraction and/or habitat conversion to agricultural crops.","Historically this species has been overlooked in terms of research and conservation, but in the past five years, considerable progress has been made in compiling and producing a species-wide assessment of population size and distribution by members of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group (IUCN SSC GOSG).<br/><br/>The generation length calculated by Pacifici <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2013) is not based upon lifetime data from field work. They report maximum longevity of 37.4 years, despite the consensus among field biologists that Giraffes live for less than 30 years in the wild (Dagg and Foster 1982, Estes 1991, du Toit 2009, Bercovitch and Berry 2010b). They suggest a reproductive lifespan of 32.4 years, which surpasses the interval between average age at first birth in the wild (6.4 years, Bercovitch and Berry 2010b) and the oldest documented age at giving birth in the wild (24 years, Bercovitch and Berry 2010b). Given that no age-specific reproductive rates have been published for Giraffes in the wild, and that the only lifetime data to have been published indicates a maximum breeding lifespan of less than 18 years, the IUCN SSC GOSG consensus is that a generation length of 14.4 years is inaccurate and assumes a more likely generation length of 10 years. Therefore this assessment is based upon the best information available from the last 30 years (1985-2015). However, because the species resides in discrete subpopulations living in different regions of Africa that have not been the subject of a systematic survey from a single date, we have based historic estimates on the best available information for each subspecies that was obtained the closest in time to 1985 (three generations).<br/><br/>Historic and current estimates adopted a variety of methods that included both aerial and ground surveys, as well as photographic capture/re-capture, interviews and best estimates. Therefore, whilst the accuracy and quality of the data are somewhat inconsistent, the population counts contain the most reliable information currently available. The historical and current estimates of population size in all nine recognized subspecies, and the global totals are summarized in Table 1 (see the Supplementary Material). Several populations of Giraffe, resident in northern Botswana, northwest Zimbabwe, northeastern Namibia and southwestern Zambia, are potentially either <em>Giraffa c. angolensis</em>, or <em>G. c. giraffa</em>. These are provisionally lumped into <em>G. c. angolensis</em> for purposes of establishing the total population counts, pending further taxonomic research.<br/><br/>These estimates show in total that numbers were 151,702-163,452 in 1985 and 97,562 in 2015. The IUCN SSC GOSG pan-African database revealed that approximately 70%  of individuals within a population could be considered ‘mature’ for  status assessment purposes (IUCN SSC GOSG meeting, August 2015). These figures therefore represent approximately 106,191-114,416 mature individuals in 1985 and 68,293 in 2015, representing a decline of 36-40% in the number of mature individuals over the three generations. The factors causing observed population declines (levels of exploitation and decline in area of occupancy) have not ceased and may not be reversible throughout the species’ range. Some Giraffe populations are stable or increasing, while others are declining, and each population is subject to pressure from threats specific to their local country or region, but the species-level trend reveals an overall large decline in numbers across their range in Africa.<br/><br/>The populations of Giraffes are scattered and fragmented with different growth trajectories and threats. Based upon the IUCN SSC GOSG population assessments and subspecies status surveys, the number of Giraffes in Eastern Africa is generally decreasing, while populations in Southern Africa are generally increasing. The only Giraffe population in West Africa is increasing, while those in Central Africa are, in general, decreasing. The population sizes of the nine subspecies varies widely, with two of them (<em>G. c. giraffa </em>and <em>G. c. tippelskirchi</em>) accounting for close to half of Giraffes living in Africa, while the other seven subspecies live in scattered, fragmented populations, with some numbering fewer than 1,000 animals.<br/><br/>Of the nine subspecies, four are increasing (<em>G. c. angolensis, G. c. giraffa, G. c. peralta,&#160;</em><em>G. c. rothschildi</em>), four are decreasing (<em>G. c. antiquorum, G. c. camelopardalis, G. c. reticulata, G. c. tippelskirchi</em>), and one is stable (<em>G. c. thornicrofti</em>). See Table 1 in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/>One possible indicator of a continent-wide trend in population-wide declines over time relates to Giraffe herd sizes. Late 19th and early 20th century explorers and hunters commented on the large size of Giraffe herds, often some 20-30 animals. However, on average many Giraffe herds studied today contain fewer than six individuals (Brand 2007, Bercovitch and Berry 2010a, Carter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, VanderWaal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). In the Seronera region of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, from the mid-1970s to 2010 both the average herd size, and the maximum herd size, have halved, from nine to 4.3 and from 77 to 38, respectively (Strauss <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). However, smaller herd sizes need not reflect declines in population sizes, but could reflect more segmented and scattered groups resulting from human changes to the landscape. In general, larger herds are sighted in more open areas (Bercovitch and Berry 2010a), and over 50 animals are still sometimes recorded (M. Brown unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In Eastern Africa, <em>G. c. camelopardalis</em> has declined from an historic estimate of 20,577 individuals in 1979/1981 to the current estimate of 650 individuals (-97%, Wube <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. tippelskirchi</em> has declined from an historic estimate of 63,292 individuals to the current estimate of 35,000 individuals (-50%, Bolger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. reticulata</em> has declined from an historic estimate of 36,000-47,750 individuals to the current estimate of 8,661 individuals (Kenya Wildlife Service in preparation, Doherty <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. rothschildi</em> has increased from an historic estimate of 1,331 individuals in the 1960s to the current estimate of 1,671 individuals within their natural range (26%, Fennessy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. thornicrofti</em> has stabilized at close to 600 individuals since 1973 (Berry and Bercovitch 2016), following an increase from approximately 300 giraffes in the early 1970s (Bercovitch <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Southern Africa, <em>G. c. angolensis</em> has increased from an historic estimate of 5,000 individuals to the current estimate of 13,031 individuals (+161%, Marais <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. giraffa</em> has increased from an historic estimate of 8,000 individuals to the current estimate of over 21,387 individuals (+167%, Deacon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). The population resident in the north eastern Namibia, northern Botswana, northwestern Zambia and northwestern and central Zimbabwe are of uncertain taxonomic status and are considered as <em>Giraffa c. angolensis</em> for this report, and are estimated to have increased from approximately 10,000 historically to the current estimate of 17,551 (J. Fennessy, unpubl. data). <br/><br/>In Central Africa, <em>G. c. antiquorum</em> has decreased from an historic estimate of 3,696 individuals to the current estimate of 2,000 individuals (-46%, Fennessy and Marais 2016).<br/><br/>In West Africa <em>G. c. peralta</em> has increased from an historic estimate of at least 50 individuals to the current estimate of 400 individuals (+700%, Fennessy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).",Decreasing,"This species is the world's tallest land mammal and remains widespread across southern and eastern Africa, with smaller isolated populations in west and central Africa. Giraffes inhabit eighteen African countries and have been reintroduced to three others (Malawi, Rwanda, and Swaziland). Giraffes from South Africa have been introduced to Senegal. Giraffes appear to have gone extinct in at least seven countries (Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal). Giraffes have adapted to a variety of habitats, ranging from desert landscapes to woodland/savanna environments, but live in non-continuous, fragmented populations across sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Table 1 in the Supplementary Material summarizes the current conservation status of the nine subspecies. West African Giraffes (<em>Giraffa c. peralta</em>) are limited to an isolated population in the south-western corner of Niger and in 2008 this subspecies was categorized as Endangered on The IUCN Red List (Fennessy and Brown 2008). In Central Africa, <em>G. c. antiquorum</em> inhabit Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. East Africa is home to four subspecies of Giraffes, with three of them living in Kenya. <em>G. c. camelopardalis</em> occurs in both South Sudan and Ethiopia, although information regarding the area of occupancy of this population of Giraffes is limited. Giraffes living in north-eastern Kenya, and across the borders in south-eastern Ethiopia and south-western Somalia, are <em>G. c. reticulata</em>, those living in Uganda and introduced to central and southwest Kenya are categorized as <em>G. c. rothschildi </em>– and in 2010 this subspecies was categorized by the IUCN Red List as Endangered (Fennessy and Brenneman 2010), and those in southern Kenya, along with large tracts of Tanzania, are considered to be <em>G. c. tippelsckirchi</em>. In Southern Africa, the population living in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia, is <em>G. c. thornicrofti</em>. Angola, southern and northern Botswana, Mozambique, northeast Namibia, South Africa, and southwest Zambia are home to <em>G. c. giraffa</em>, whilst <em>G. c. angolensis</em> occurs in central Botswana and Namibia. Confusion still exists as to whether the giraffes in northern Botswana, north-eastern Namibia, south-western Zambia and north-western Zimbabwe are <em>G. c. angolensis</em> or <em>G. c. giraffa</em>, and for purposes of establishing the total population counts and trends here are lumped into <em>G. c. angolensis</em>.",Legal hunting of Giraffes occurs in parts of southern Africa. Illegal hunting for meat takes place in several parts of the range. There is some trade in live specimens between game ranches in southern Africa.,Terrestrial,"Given that some Giraffe populations are increasing, some are decreasing, and one seems to be stable, the conservation actions most useful and appropriate for Giraffes will differ as a function of Giraffe population dynamics, ecological stability, national policies, and legislation. Giraffes are subject to various degrees of legal protection in their range states. Large populations occur in national protected areas and on private farms, but many populations also exist in unprotected and communal areas. The main threats to the conservation of Giraffe populations are habitat loss, encroachment and conversion, and poaching.<br/>&#160; <br/>Conservation measures typically include habitat management and protection through law enforcement and community based conservation initiatives. Successful protection of habitat and cessation of habitat encroachment with the use of fences and border protection can result in large herds building up within an area. The continued growth of these populations however is limited by the ability of that ecosystem to support a particular number of Giraffes due to space, water and forage availability (i.e., limited carrying capacity).<br/><br/>In Niger, conservation projects and targeted community education and awareness programs have facilitated the re-bounding of the Giraffe population from a low of 49 individuals in the absence of official protected areas. However, habitat loss and drought remain as significant threats in this area. Importantly, the government was the first and remains the only range state to have developed a National Giraffe Conservation Strategy, and through this the conservation of the species has increased nearly eightfold in twenty years.<br/><br/>Kenya is finalising a National Giraffe Conservation Strategy which seeks to identify and implement a number of conservation interventions to conserve the three Giraffe subspecies (<em>Giraffa reticulata, G. rothschildi, G. tippelskirchi</em>) in the country. Rothschild’s Giraffes are accorded full protection under the Kenyan Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act (Chapter 376) and in the Republic of Uganda Giraffe are protected under the Game (Preservation and Control) Act of 1959 (Chapter 198) and listed under Part A of the First Schedule of the Act as animals that may not be hunted or captured.<br/><br/>Throughout Eastern and Southern Africa, an increasing number of Giraffe translocations have repopulated former habitats with Giraffes, fostering wildlife enterprises including tourism and consumptive use, and maintaining genetic diversity given small, enclosed and fragmented populations.<br/><br/>Although one of the smallest populations in Africa lives in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia, the population has been stable for a number of years, so intervention as a conservation action is probably not warranted. Instead, continued monitoring of the population, combined with efforts to limit and control mineral extraction and land conversion, would be useful.<br/><br/>In Southern Africa, private ownership of Giraffes sometimes facilitates the gene flow between populations as animals are bought, sold and traded between farms. Perhaps a more controlled and systematic pattern of Giraffe translocations would help in the conservation of Giraffes.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
143160967,811,Alcelaphus buselaphus,Least Concern,,2019,2015-08-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"East (1999) estimated numbers of all Hartebeest subspecies at <em>ca</em> 360,000. The most numerous subspecies, Red Hartebeest (130,000) is increasing, although population trends in the other subspecies are declining. On this basis the species as a whole does not meet the criteria for threatened or Near Threatened status.","More tolerant of woodland areas and high grass than other alcelaphines, Hartebeest prefer the edge to the middle of open plains; for example, in open areas such as the grassland of the Serengeti N.P. in Tanzania, they are typically found around the edge of woodland (Estes 1991, Gosling and Capellini 2013). They thus appear to be an edge or ecotone species (Booth 1985), generally avoiding more closed woodland. They have been recorded to 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). Almost exclusively grazers, Hartebeests feed selectively in medium-height grassland; they are less water dependent than other alcelaphines, but nonetheless dependent on the availability of surface drinking water.","Hartebeest have decreased markedly in numbers across their range, and their distribution has been increasingly fragmented, as a result of over-hunting for meat and the expansion of settlement and livestock. As has already occurred over much of the rest of the species’ former range, some key populations are currently decreasing because of poaching, and/or other factors such as drought and disease in some cases. In Comoé N.P., for example, numbers declined by 60% from 18,300 in 1984 to an estimated 5,200 in 1998 (Fischer and Linsenmair 2001). The distributions of most Hartebeest subspecies are likely to become increasingly fragmented until they are confined to those areas where there is effective control of poaching and encroachment by livestock and settlement.","East (1999) estimated the total populations of Hartebeest at about 362,000 animals (including Lichtenstein's). However, this total is clearly influenced by the number of surviving Red Hartebeest in southern Africa, which East (1999) estimated to number about 130,000 (with 40% on private land and 25% in protected areas). In contrast, less than 800 Swayne’s Hartebeest survive in Ethiopia, with the overwhelming majority of the population in the Senkele sanctuary and Mazie N.P. (Refera 2005). Estimates of population size for the remaining subspecies were: 36,000 Western Hartebeest (&gt;95% in and around protected areas); 70,000 Lelwel (about 40% in protected areas); 3,500 Kenya hartebeest (6% in protected areas and most of the rest on ranchland); 82,000 Lichtenstein's Hartebeest; and 42,000 Coke’s Hartebeest (about 70% in protected areas). The surviving number of Tora Hartebeest (if any) is unknown. Lelwel Hartebeest may have undergone a major decline since the 1980s, when its total numbers were estimated to be &gt;285,000, mainly in CAR and southern Sudan (East 1999). Recent survey work conducted in the dry season estimated totals of 1,070 and 115 animals for Southern N.P. and Boma N.P., respectively (Fay <em>et al.</em> 2007); the latter is a significant decline from the more than 50,000 animals estimated in the dry season of 1980 by Fryxell (1980).",Decreasing,"Hartebeest (<em>Alcelaphus buselaphus</em>) formerly ranged from North Africa and the Middle East throughout the savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa and the miombo woodlands of south-central Africa down to the tip of southern Africa; they are absent only from desert and forest, notably the Sahara and the Guinea and Congo Basin rainforests (Gosling and Capellini 2013). <br/><br/>In North Africa, the Bubal Hartebeest occurred in Morocco, Algeria, southern Tunisia, Libya, and parts of the Western Desert in Egypt (the precise southern limits of distribution are not known). Numerous Hartebeest remains have been found in excavations of fossils in Egypt and the Middle East, especially Israel and Jordan, and these, together with illustrations in the tombs of ancient Egyptians, are assumed to be Bubal Hartbeest (Gosling and Capellini 2013). Bubal Hartebeest are now Extinct, the last animals having been shot between 1945 and 1954 in Algeria (De Smet 1989). The last report from south-eastern Morocco was in 1945 (Panouse 1957). <br/><br/>The historical and current ranges of the remaining subspecies can be summarized as follows (after East 1999, Gosling and Capellini 2013):<br/><br/>Western Hartebeest ranged from Senegal eastwards to western Central African Republic and south-west Chad, although they have always been marginal in these last two countries. They have disappeared from much of their former range in this region, surviving mainly in and around protected areas; they no longer occur in The Gambia (though migrants may enter from Senegal).<br/><br/>Tora Hartebeest formerly occurred in western and southwestern Eritrea, north-western Ethiopia and the adjacent border regions of Sudan; they may survive in low numbers in the savannas of Eritrea and some inaccessible parts of Ethiopia, but there have been no reports for many years and it is considered possibly extinct.<br/><br/>Swayne’s Hartebeest occurred throughout the Rift Valley in Ethiopia into northwest Somalia, but now survive in three protected areas: Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, Nech Sar N.P. and Mazie N.P. (Gosling and Capellinin 2013). They became extinct in north-west Somalia early in the 20th century because of rinderpest.<br/><br/>Lelwel Hartebeest range from southern Chad through Central African Republic, southern Sudan, northern and north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, south-west Ethiopia, north-west Kenya, northern Uganda and extreme north-western Tanzania. They have undergone dramatic reductions in numbers particularly in Uganda and Central African Republic, where they are now reduced to a few protected areas. <br/><br/>Coke’s Hartebeest occurred widely throughout southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. They have lost much of their range, but populations still occur in the Serengeti and Tarangire in Tanzania and Tsavo, and the Mara in Kenya.<br/><br/>Lichtenstein’s Hartebeest formerly occurred widely in the miombo woodlands of south-central Africa (probably as far south as KwaZulu-Natal), but now occur mainly in wildlife areas in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia; they are extinct in Burundi. <br/><br/>Red Hartebeest occur throughout much of southern Africa (and marginally into Angola near the Namibian border), and although much reduced by European colonists, they are now expanding their range again as they have been reintroduced into many protected areas and private game farms (and widely introduced outside their former range).","The Hartebeest is hunted for food and sport and&#160;are particularly valued for their high-quality meat (Gosling and Capellini 2013). As the bushmeat trade escalates out of control, partly fuelled by the increase in modern guns, many Hartebeest populations are being hunted to extinction, although the use and trade of Red Hartebeest appears to be sustainable and the species is in fact increasing (Gosling and Capellini 2013).",Terrestrial,"The largest numbers of the more abundant subspecies occur in the following areas: Western Hartebeest: Niokolo-Koba (Senegal) - although this population declined by half in the 1990s alone, Comoé N. P. (Côte d’Ivoire) - although as noted this population also declined by 60% between 1984 and 1998 (Fischer and Linsenmair 2001), Nazinga and Diefoula (Burkina Faso), Mole (Ghana), Pendjari (Benin) and the national parks and hunting zones of North Province (Cameroon); Lelwel: Zakouma and eastern Salamat (Chad), Manovo-Gounda-St. Floris and Sangba (Central African Republic), Garamba (Congo-Kinshasa), Mago-Murule (Ethiopia) and Murchison Falls (Uganda); Coke’s Hartebeest: Tsavo, Masai Mara, Kajiado and coastal hinterland (Kenya) and Serengeti, Tarangire and Sadani (Tanzania); Lichtenstein's Hartebeest: Selous ecosystem, Moyowosi-Kigosi, Ugalla River, Katavi-Rukwa and Ruaha-Rungwa-Kisigo (Tanzania) and in Kafue National Park and the Luangwa Valley (Zambia); Red Hartebeest: private farmland (Namibia), central and south-western protected areas and adjoining rangelands (Botswana) and protected areas and private farmland (South Africa) (East 1999, Gosling and Capellini 2013)<br/><br/>Swayne's Hartebeest are confined entirely to three protected areas: Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, Nech Sar N.P.,&#160; and Mazie N.P. (Gosling and Capellini 2013); the survival of Swayne’s in Ethiopia depends on improved protection of these remaining populations. Surveys are urgently required to determine the presence, distribution and status of the Tora Hartebeest in areas such as western Eritrea, as a precursor to the development and implementation of protective measures.<br/><br/>Although Hartebeest are present in captivity, no individuals of Swayne’s and Tora Hartebeests are held in captivity .",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
144226239,3746,Canis lupus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-05-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)<br/>EU 28 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)<br/><br/>Following the bottleneck of the 1960s and 1970s, the European wolf subpopulation&#160;is generally increasing in number and expanding its distribution range. Based on the best available data, the total number of wolves in the EU 28 Members States is likely to be in the order of 13,000-14,000, and the number of wolves in geographic Europe (excluding Russia) is likely to exceed 17,000, a marked increase over the last ten years. Consequently, the species qualifies as Least Concern at both the European and EU 28 level. The quantity and quality of data on population size and structure varies greatly between European countries: see Appendix 1 for an explanation of the methods used to obtain the numbers for each subpopulation.<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Near Threatened. The Iberian subpopulation&#160;is large (about 2,500 wolves) and expanding towards the south and east. It does not qualify for the category Vulnerable and it is maintained in the Near Threatened category because of the fragmentation in management regimes, the lack of a subpopulation-level management plan, the occurrence of largely unpredictable events of human persecution (poison, shooting, etc.) that may threaten the subpopulation&#160;at the local level and the near isolation of some of its subpopulation&#160;segments. Wolf presence in the Sierra Morena area is limited to few signs (last recorded in 2014): the species is below functional levels and is possibly locally extinct.<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>Vulnerable (D1). The Alpine subpopulation&#160;was founded based on a recent expansion of the Italian peninsula wolf subpopulation&#160;and has grown rapidly and steadily (10-20% /year) to about 420-550 wolves in 2015/2016. It may be estimated to be 550-700 in 2017/2018. However, it has limited genetic and demographic contacts with the adjacent source subpopulation&#160;in the Apennines (Fabbri <em>et al.</em> 2007), meaning that it qualifies as a discrete subpopulation under IUCN Red List guidelines. Its relatively small size with an estimated at least 330-415 mature individuals, its relative isolation and dispersion over a large range justifies its assessment in category Vulnerable (D1).<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Near Threatened. The Italian peninsula wolf subpopulation&#160;is estimated to be 1,100-2,400 individuals. The shape of the range is narrow and elongated, mainly restricted to the Apennines mountains. The subpopulation&#160;has limited exchange with the subpopulation&#160;of the western-central Alps and recent genetic evidence indicates a flow of genes only in the direction toward the Alps. In spite of the recent increase in numbers and range, the Italian peninsula wolf subpopulation&#160;is locally vulnerable to local extermination from human pressures (poison, shooting) and the locally high prevalence of wolf-dog hybridization. The stochastic nature of these events suggests that the subpopulation&#160;may easily reverse its current favourable status. If considered at the lowest limit of the estimate (1,100), the subpopulation&#160;would qualify for the category Vulnerable (D1) as the number of mature individuals would be less than 1,000. However, it is likely that the true size of the subpopulation&#160;is between the upper and lower estimates, hence the use of Near Threatened.<br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>Least Concern. This wolf subpopulation&#160;does not qualify for any Threatened categories because of its large size (c.4,000 animals) and wide distribution. However, several parts of the range may be subject to excessive pressure from lethal control and poorly regulated hunting. In many countries the data quality is poor, and management plans are poorly developed or absent.<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>Least Concern. This large wolf subpopulation&#160;(c.3,460-3,840 animals) appears to be maintaining its conservation status mainly due to the management implemented in Romania. Some of the peripheral areas of the range may be subject to excessive hunting and poaching pressure (e.g. Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria), limiting the recovery of the subpopulation&#160;in those areas (Kutal <em>et al.</em> 2016) and may require appropriate conservation measures to limit mortality. In other countries, wolves are fully protected (e.g. Poland and the Czech Republic). These peripheral areas are under threat because of completely different management regimes implemented in neighbouring countries (Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) (Nowak <em>et al.</em> 2008). To ensure the viability of these peripheral parts of the Carpathian subpopulation&#160;it is important to coordinate management at the international level. <br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>Least Concern. The relatively large number of wolves (c.1,713–2,240) in the EU members (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) and the continuity of its range into Russia and Belarus support its assessment in the category of Least Concern. A large part of the subpopulation&#160;is fully protected in eastern Poland (1,040 wolves). However, the portions of the subpopulation&#160;in some of the Baltic States are intensively hunted with high hunting quotas at 40-50% and may require conservation measures to ensure their long-term persistence. <br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>Near Threatened. The total subpopulation, shared by Finland and Russian Karelia is estimated to be 750 individuals and would qualify for Vulnerable. However, the Karelian subpopulation&#160;is generally considered to have connections with the very large Russian subpopulation, and there could potentially be a rescue effect, so the subpopulation-level assessment is downgraded by one step to Near Threatened. The total subpopulation&#160;size&#160;in Finland is small (c.200 mature individuals) and it would qualify for the category of Endangered (D1) if it was isolated. The number of wolves in Russian Karelia is not well known but is likely to be in the order of 500 and it may be declining as a result of excessive persecution. The degree of fragmentation is not known. Very little information is currently available on the status of the wolf in Russian Karelia, and this subpopulation&#160;should be reassessed if any new relevant data becomes available.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Vulnerable (D1). The subpopulation&#160;size is well known (430, CI = 340-559) and the estimated number of mature individuals (c.260) justifies the category Vulnerable. The subpopulation&#160;has low genetic variability due to a small number of founders and has little genetic exchange with the Karelian subpopulation. The management policies (low population goals and high hunting/control quotas) in Norway dramatically affect the future conservation prospects of the overall subpopulation, and there is no common management plan at the subpopulation&#160;level.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European<br/></strong>Vulnerable (D1). This subpopulation&#160;has grown very rapidly since 2000 and it is now estimated in the order of 780-1,030 wolves. The estimated number of mature individuals is 468-620, justifying the category Vulnerable. In Germany, the number of mature individuals has been estimated to be at least 150-160 (BfN 2017). In the German part of the subpopulation, the expansion is mainly occurring in a northwest direction, whereas the expansion to the southwest is taken place slowly. Although the geographic gap between the Central European subpopulation&#160;and the Baltic subpopulation&#160;is nearly closed the genetic exchange between both subpopulations&#160;appears to be limited (Pilot <em>et al.</em> 2006, Hulva <em>et al.</em> 2018).","Wolves live in diverse habitat types and their broad distribution ranges show the species' adaptability to the most extreme (both in terms of natural and anthropogenic factors) habitat conditions. The wolf's habitat has been prosaically described as anywhere where humans do not kill it and where there is something to eat. Where wolves depend on wild ungulate prey, their habitat is that of their prey. Habitat quality should thus be interpreted in terms of human disturbance, prey densities and range size. In general, large forest areas are particularly suitable for wolves in Europe, although wolves are not exclusively a forest species. The wolf has a very diversified diet and is a true generalist that feeds opportunistically on what is most available in its habitat. The wolf’s diet may include large prey, such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar, as well as small mammals and birds, invertebrates, vegetation and carcasses. Diet composition throughout the geographic range and seasonal variations depends on the relative abundance of potential prey, as well as accessibility and availability. A wolf typically requires 3-5 kg of meat per day, although it can fast for several days when food is not readily available.","Human intolerance is perhaps the most important limiting factor facing wolves in Europe today. Fear, misunderstanding and the fact that wolves do kill livestock have prompted an uneasy relationship with people in many areas, leading to direct conflicts and retaliatory/preventative persecution. In some countries, poorly regulated hunting of wolves poses a threat, while in others licenses for killing wolves are issued irrespective of biological understanding. Poaching is widespread and probably represents the most important mortality factor for the wolf in many parts of Europe. Wolf depredation on domestic animals has been a problem since man progressed from hunter/gatherer to farmer, and although the numbers of sheep or cattle taken are, as a percentage, very low, livestock depredation remains the primary reason for persecuting wolves. Wolves have also become symbolic of wider issues of social change facing rural life, such that the politics of wolf management has become very controversial and intertwined with multiple other issues. It also appears that institutions in many countries are ill-equipped to handle the biological and socio-politic challenges of wolf management. Human land use is the most significant threat to wolf habitat. Wolves can live close to humans but they require safe areas in which to retreat. This is not always considered in land use planning in wolf areas and the small, fragmented subpopulations&#160;in western Europe can result in animals moving into unsuitable habitat. Although wolves show a good ability to cross linear infrastructure like highways and railroads, these structures can be associated with wolf mortality and there is a need to ensure wildlife permeability in all infrastructure projects. Wolf-dog hybridization has been increasingly reported in most European countries but only appears to be a major issue in Italy and other Mediterranean countries because of poor dog management practices. Legislation and public attitudes towards dog management and dog control policies impede the implementation of a coordinated effort to manage the occurrence and spread of hybridization (Ciucci 2012). Specific threats to different European wolf subpopulations are as follows:<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Illegal killing is still common (estimated to account for 50% of the total mortality) and poison baits are still used. Illegal killing appears the primary cause of the (virtual) disappearance of the Sierra Morena subpopulation. <br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>Documented causes of mortality include car or train accidents and poaching. Several cases of illegal killing have been reported in France and Italy, and conflicts with hunters and farmers are constantly reported. Both France and the Regional Government of Piemonte have been carrying out extensive and continuous research and monitoring of the wolf subpopulation&#160;and damages to livestock, and excellent data is available for management purposes. The number of livestock depredations in the Italian Alps is decreasing, despite the increase in wolf numbers, due to the large efforts in the implementation of preventive practices promoted by the authorities. Although wolf presence is still far from being accepted by local farmers and livestock breeders, the general attitude is improving (<a href=""http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/"">LIFE WOLFALPS</a>).<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;is protected on paper, but the law is poorly enforced with illegal killing remaining common (and rarely prosecuted) throughout the range. Poison baits are increasingly used against dogs, foxes and wolves. Hybridization with dogs has been documented and, in certain areas of central Italy, it appears to account for at least 40% of the total wolf subpopulation&#160;(Verardi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Ciucci 2012). <br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>There is an enormous diversity in threats occurring throughout the range. Poorly regulated legal hunting and illegal killing, often with the use of poison) are taking an unknown number of wolves throughout most of the range. Other pressures that are commonly reported include; habitat fragmentation due to the construction of fenced highways and a shortage of wild prey. In many countries, there is very limited knowledge about wolf ecology or status (Huber <em>et al.</em> 2002, Iliopoulos 2005, Trbojević 2016).<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>Poison baits and illegal killing are widespread throughout the range. In Ukraine, wolves are treated as a pest species. Poorly regulated legal hunting in Slovakia hinders the recovery of the wolf in the Czech-Slovak borderlands (Kutal <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>The Baltic subpopulation&#160;is subject to hunter harvest in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Access to good quality population monitoring data is, therefore, crucial to ensure that quotas are set at sustainable levels. There is room for substantial improvement in monitoring effort in Latvia and Lithuania.<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>The main threat to wolves in this region is killing by humans. In south-central Finland, wolves cause very limited damage to livestock, but predation on domestic dogs and a perception of competition for game species is the most frequent impact that causes strong resentment from the public. In the north of Finland, potential conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer herding effectively prevent its expansion.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Due to the small number of founders the inbreeding coefficient is very high, on average higher than for full siblings mating (Liberg <em>et al.</em> 2005). Predation on domestic dogs, sheep and semi-domestic reindeer are the most frequent damages that cause continuing debate on wolf conservation. In the north of Sweden and Norway, potential conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer herding effectively prevent its expansion. Norway has a restrictive policy that officially prevents further expansion.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>The main cause of documented mortality in Germany is traffic accidents (70%). Cases of illegal killing have been reported in Poland and Germany, and complaints from hunters and farmers are constantly reported from Germany. The implementation of livestock protection measures in Germany does not keep track with the fast population growth providing the ground for permanent and growing conflict with farmers, whereas such conflicts appear to be much less in the Polish subpopulation&#160;segment. The habitat is also very heavily modified and fragmented. Coordination between the federal states of Germany and between Germany and neighbouring countries is crucial.","Because of the diversity in climate, topography, vegetation, patterns of human settlement and historical development of wolf range, wolf populations in various parts of the original range vary dramatically in&#160; density Wolf densities normally vary from about one per 12 km² to less than one per 120 km² (Mech and Boitani 2003). The overall European wolf population can be viewed as a large metapopulation with several distinct fragments, although dispersal could theoretically connect almost all fragments, and connections are being re-established in many areas. Following the bottleneck of the 1960s and 1970s, the European wolf population is generally increasing in number and expanding its distribution range. However, some European populations are still small and not all have more than 1,000 animals (see below for specific details). Dispersing animals can potentially be found anywhere in mainland Europe, for example as revealed by the appearance of transient individuals in the Netherlands and Belgium. The total number of wolves in the EU 28 is likely to be in the order of 13-14,000; some of the subpopulations&#160;are continuous with wolf populations living in countries outside the EU. The number of wolves in geographic Europe (excluding Russia) is likely to exceed 17,000.<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Subpopulation&#160;size: 2,160-2,880 wolves. The Iberian wolf (<em>Canis lupus signatus</em>) may be a distinct subspecies. After the population reduction up to the 1960s, it has increased dramatically since the 1970s and has been stable or slightly increasing in the last ten years and expanding its range across central Spain. The subpopulation&#160;occupies most of north-western Iberia and is expanding south and east after having crossed the Duero River in Spain. There are two distinct subpopulation&#160;segments within this subpopulation. The largest is that north of the Duero River&#160;in both Spain and Portugal. South of the Duero in Portugal there is a small subpopulation&#160;segment of around 50 wolves which has only limited exchange of animals with the segments north of the Duero in Portugal and east to the Spanish segment south of the Duero.<br/><br/>The nearest wolf subpopulation&#160;is in the western Alps and connections between the two are non-existent or limited to exceptional cases. In the Pyrenees (regions of Cataluña and Aragón) there are currently a few non-reproducing wolves that have been genetically identified as members of the Alpine subpopulation&#160;from where they are assumed to have dispersed naturally (Alvares <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Blanco and Cortés 2012, Jiménez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, López-Bao <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018, Torres and Fonseca 2016).<br/><br/>The isolated Sierra Morena subpopulation&#160;in southern Spain has (virtually) disappeared.<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>Subpopulation&#160;size: c.550-700 wolves. This subpopulation&#160;is of Italian Apennines origin and all wolves share the same distinctive Italian genetic haplotype. Individual wolves dispersing from the Apennines first colonized the Alps in 1992 and succeeded in establishing a permanent and expanding population which shows a highly dynamic spatial pattern spreading towards the west and north (and then to the east along the Alpine arc). Dispersing animals are regularly reported in Switzerland where there are about 30 wolves. More recently (2015) dispersing individuals from Dinaric-Balkans and the western Alps formed a pack in the central Alps. The total number in 2015/2016 was estimated to be about 420-550 wolves (65 packs and 12 pairs; WAG 2018, Marucco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), and in 2017/18 it may be estimated to be 550-700, increasing on average by 10-20% per year. The genetic continuity with the Apennines subpopulation&#160;has been recently assessed at 1.25-2.5 individuals per generation, all of them moving from the Apennines to the Alpine subpopulation&#160;(Fabbri <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). In 2005, a young radio-marked wolf dispersed more than 1300 km from Parma (Italy) to Nice (France), providing a demonstration of the natural dispersal along the northern Apennines range to the Alps. In spite of the continuity between the two subpopulations, their ecological and socio-economic contexts are sufficiently different to justify a separation into two functional population units for management purposes (Marucco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017, LCIE 2007, <a href=""http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/Quoi-de-neuf-Le-Bulletin-d-information-du-reseau-loup-download130"">http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/Quoi-de-neuf-Le-Bulletin-d-information-du-reseau-loup-download130</a>, <a href=""http://www.kora.ch/"">http://www.kora.ch/</a>, <a href=""http://carmen.carmencarto.fr/38/Loup_presence_communale.map"">http://carmen.carmencarto.fr/38/Loup_presence_communale.map</a>, <a href=""http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/"">http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/</a>).<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 1,070-2,400 wolves. The subpopulation&#160;was described in 1921 (Altobello 1921) and confirmed in 1999 (Nowak 1999) as a distinct subspecies (<em>Canis lupus italicus</em>). It is genetically recognized by the presence of a unique mtDNA haplotype. After the population bottleneck of the 1960s, when total numbers were estimated to be about 100 animals, the subpopulation&#160;has steadily recovered throughout the Apennines and expanded into the western Alps. In 2006, the subpopulation&#160;was estimated to be 500-800 wolves, but recent estimates (2017) suggest numbers to be 1,100-2,400 with an estimate of 1600 probably being close to the real number. However, the difference between the 2006 and 2017 estimates is also due to improved estimation methods. The nearest subpopulation&#160;(apart from that in the western Alps, see above) is in Slovenia (Dinaric-Balkan subpopulation). However, a large portion of the central Alps and the agricultural Po River valley effectively separate the Italian peninsula and the Dinaric subpopulations&#160;(Galaverni <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Boitani and Salvatori 2016).<br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 3,750-4,000 wolves. There is continuity of the subpopulation&#160;and suitable habitats throughout the range although the subpopulation&#160;might be significantly sub-structured within this massive elongated range. Although the subpopulation&#160;is estimated to number almost 4,000 individuals, locally the densities may vary greatly and its overall demographic trend is unknown. In Croatia and Slovenia, the subpopulation&#160;has recovered significantly following improved management in the 1990s. In Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Trbojević 2016) it is likely that the subpopulation&#160;has decreased in recent few years due to overharvesting. To the north, the subpopulation&#160;has no functional contact with the nearest subpopulation&#160;in Italy, although dispersing animals are reported in Austria and one dispersing male successfully established a pair and a territory in Veneto (northern Italy) with a mate from the western-central Alps subpopulation. To the east, the subpopulation&#160;may exchange individuals with the large wolf subpopulation&#160;of the Carpathians which extends into northern Bulgaria and eastern Serbia (Iliopoulos 1999; Kusak <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005; Štrbenac <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005; Jeremic <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, 2015, 2016; Trbojević 2016).<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>This subpopulation&#160;is estimated to number c.3,460-3,840 animals, the majority of them living in Romania and Ukraine. The difference between the 2006 and 2017 estimates is partly due to improved estimation methods. Slovakia hosts about 300-400 wolves and southern Poland contributes with good wolf habitat in the areas along its southern borders (the wolf subpopulation&#160;in the Polish Carpathians is about 380 individuals). In the past, there was natural continuity with wolves living in northern Poland and Belarus, but this link is now constrained by large areas where wolves have been exterminated. Nevertheless, it is likely that some level of genetic exchange still occurs with the Dinaric-Balkan subpopulation&#160;in western Bulgaria / eastern Serbia, and with the Baltic subpopulation&#160;in eastern-central Poland (Okarma 1993; CLCP 1997-98, 2000, 2001, 2002; Smietana and Wajda 1997, Okarma <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Shkvyrya 2008, Cazacu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Pirga <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Rigg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>Subopulation size: about 1,713–2,240 wolves in EU countries and an additional 1,000-1,500 in Belarus and 1,600 in the adjacent Russian oblasts. At the start of the 20th-century the subpopulation was greatly reduced, but still widely present, these increased during and after World War 1. In the period between the wars, populations were greatly reduced again, but recovered to peak levels during and after World War II, only to be heavily persecuted in the 1950s such that they again reached very low levels in the 1960s and early 1970s. The populations appear to have then increased, peaking in the early 1990s – before being reduced again in the late 1990s. This subpopulation&#160;is the westernmost portion of the large Russian subpopulation&#160;and it ultimately connects with the wolf range of Russian Karelia. In Poland, although the distribution is not continuous, it is highly likely that dispersal regularly connects the Baltic and Central European subpopulation&#160;(Bluzma 2000, Sidorovich <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Linnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Nowak and Mysłajek 2016, Bragina <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018, Ozolins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Kawata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Geldon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 204-234 wolves in Finland and about 750 including Finland and Russian Karelia. Following widespread control of the subpopulation&#160;in the first part of 20th century, the subpopulation&#160;recovered after the 1980s and 1990s. The current estimates are based on counts of family groups in Finland and the subpopulation&#160;is expanding. In Russian Karelia, wolf numbers appear to be stable.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 430 (CI = 340-559) wolves. The subpopulation&#160;derives from a pair that immigrated from Finland and first reproduced in Sweden in 1983. A third immigrant in 1991 boosted the reproduction and the subpopulation&#160;is now estimated to be 440 wolves (about 85 in Norway). The subpopulation&#160;has been steadily increasing from 1983-2001, then slightly decreased in 2002-3, and then is increasing again. There is evidence of limited further genetic exchanges with the Finnish/Russian wolf subpopulation&#160;after 1991. Immigration from Russia / Finland is the only possible mechanism to increase the genetic variability of the subpopulation&#160;which is critical for its future viability (Chapron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016; Svensson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017; Wabakken <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016).<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>Subpopulation size: 780-1030 wolves. Wolves were exterminated in Germany during the 19th century, but individuals that were dispersing from Poland were shot occasionally throughout the 20th century. In the late-1990s a pack began breeding in Saxony, and there are currently 60 packs breeding regularly and 13 pairs. Wolves in western Poland have had a dynamic history of persecution and heavy harvest with periods of total absence and very low numbers in 1950 - 1990s, but since 2000 the subpopulation&#160;started to recover from immigrants originating in eastern Poland and presently there are about 60 packs in the region. Three packs were confirmed in the Czech Republic in 2016 /2017 (Kutal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017, Hulva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018). This subpopulation&#160;is highly dynamic and dispersing animals have reached Denmark (1 confirmed pack), Belgium and the Netherlands. Connections exist to the Baltic subpopulation, but the distances are in the order of up to several hundred kilometres (Fechter and Storch 2015; Reinhardt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015; Sunde and Olsen 2017; Nowak and Myslajek 2016, 2017; Nowak <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).",Increasing,"Historically wolves were found over most of Europe, including the British Isles. By the mid-20th century, their range was greatly reduced to remnants in northwest Iberia, central Italy, parts of the Baltics, the Carpathians, and the mountain areas of the Balkans. In the last 50 years, their range has greatly expanded with wolf presence being recorded in all continental European countries (with the exception of Luxemburg). The European wolf subpopulation&#160;is currently a large meta-population with several distinct subpopulations, which can be described as follows (Chapron <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014):<br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian </strong><br/>Wolves are found in the northwestern quadrant of Iberia (both Spain and Portugal). The Iberian subpopulation&#160;does not extend as far east as to the Pyrenees (although some individuals are now colonising from the Alps, via France). Wolves are expanding southwards and are now found on both banks of the Duro River in both Spain and Portugal. The subpopulation&#160;segment in the Sierra Morena mountains in southern Spain seems to be near or at extinction (Blanco and Cortés 2002, Alvares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Blanco and Cortés 2012, Jiménez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016, López-Bao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2018).<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;occupies a large area that includes most of the Western Alps in France and Italy, many wolf packs territories being transboundary along the French-Italian border, and occupies large areas of south-eastern France up to the Massif Central. Increasing numbers of wolves are found in Switzerland as far as the canton of Grisons. Numbers are rapidly building up in Veneto and Trentino and will likely expand through most of the central Alps (<a href=""http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/Quoi-de-neuf-Le-Bulletin-d-information-du-reseau-loup-download130"">Bulletin d’information du réseau Loup</a>, <a href=""http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/"">LIFE WOLFALPS</a>, KORA (<a href=""https://www.kora.ch/"">Carnivore Ecology and Wildlife Management</a>), Cubaynes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Marescot <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Duchamp <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, WAG 2014, Schnidrig <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). The first packs based on individuals from the Alps and animals from the Dinaric-Balkan subpopulation&#160;are forming in the easternmost part of its range.<br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Wolves occur in the whole Apennines range from Liguria to Calabria (Aspromonte) and extending into northern Lazio and central western Tuscany (provinces of Siena, Grosseto and Pisa) (Ciucci and Boitani 1998, Boitani 2003, Galaverni <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Boitani and Salvatori 2016).<br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;covers a vast area from Slovenia in the north to central Greece in the south and it includes the whole Dinaric mountain range through Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, western Serbia and Kosovo, Montenegro, FYR Macedonia, Albania, and western and southern parts of Bulgaria. <br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;extends across several countries, from Northern Bulgaria and Eastern Serbia, Romania, south-western Ukraine, Slovakia and southern Poland. Small numbers of wolves are also present in the Czech Republic and Hungary on the periphery of the distribution (Kutal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016, 2017).<br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>This subpopulation&#160;covers eastern Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, northern Ukraine and the neighbouring parts of Russian (including the oblasts of Kaliningrad, Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, Tver, Smolensk, Bryansk, Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod and Orel).<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>Wolves occur in Finland (mainly in the southern half of the country) and Russian Karelia. The Karelian wolf subpopulation&#160;is the western extreme of a large Russian subpopulation&#160;which is presumed to be continuous across most of the country.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>The distribution range of the subpopulation&#160;is in central Sweden and, to a lesser extent, in southeastern Norway. It is spreading slowly toward southern Sweden but is being prevented from expansion in Norway because of government policy.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>This subpopulation&#160;is expanding rapidly into the central European lowlands from its core in the western half of Poland and the eastern part of Germany. A few packs are also found in the Czech Republic. Individuals have dispersed as far as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark (which has one established pack).",The species is sometimes hunted for sport. In some&#160;countries the species is also important for the skin market and the pelt&#160;industry.,Terrestrial,"By default, the species is strictly protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix II) and Habitats Directive (Annex II and IV), meaning that wolves may not be killed except under strict conditions, and key wolf habitat must be protected as part of the European protected area networks Natura 2000 (Habitats Directive, Annex II) and Emerald Network (Bern Convention, Appendix II). However, there are many national and regional exceptions. Regarding the Habitats Directive:<br/><br/>1) in Spain, wolves north of the Duero river are not subject to Annexes II or IV, but covered instead by the more flexible regime of Annex V, which permits harvesting – and it remains uncertain which regimes apply to wolves east of the Duero river (Trouwborst 2014);<br/>2) in Greece, wolves north of 39°N have a similar status (only Annex V);<br/>3) in the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) wolves have a similar status (only Annex V);<br/>4) in Finland, wolves occurring in the reindeer herding area in northern Finland fall under Annex V; wolves outside the reindeer herding area fall under Annex IV but not Annex II;<br/>5) In Bulgaria and Slovakia, wolves are subject to Annex II and Annex V;<br/>6) In Poland, wolves are also on Annex II and Annex V of the Habitats Directive, but strictly protected under the national legislations and government has not opened for harvest.<br/><br/>A similar set of diverse situations exist under the Bern Convention, with some countries having taken total exceptions (e.g. Finland) and others treating it as Appendix III instead of Appendix II.<br/><br/>In general, habitat restoration is required in some key areas (especially in southern Europe) in the form of fostering a healthy prey base, and encouraging wolves to move back into their former range where appropriate. Conflicts with humans need to be addressed by involving local people in wolf management plans and through education programmes to increase people's understanding of wolf biology and behaviour. Problems resulting from wolves preying on domestic animals need to be tackled by livestock protection schemes and compensation systems. In general there is a need for innovative governance regimes that balance the need for large scale (international level) coordination of management with the need to give local stakeholders a voice into local level solutions to local problems. Finally, there is a need to increase investment in population monitoring in many countries in southern and eastern Europe where the largest subpopulations&#160;live. Details of specific conservation measures for European wolf subpopulations&#160;are given below: <br/><br/><strong>1. Iberian</strong><br/>Wolves are fully protected in Portugal and south of the Duero river in Spain. North of the Duero in Spain, wolves can be game species under various management regimes depending on the legislation of 8 autonomous regional governments. The autonomous regions are gradually approving their action plans. Asturias has a wolf management plan and Galicia and Castilla y León also have approved their plans. However, management coordination among the regional governments and between Spain and Portugal is very limited. By allowing the (virtual) extinction of the Sierra Morena subpopulation&#160;in southern Spain, Spain has violated its obligations under the Habitats Directive’s Annex II and Annex IV regimes, and EU law requires the Spanish authorities to restore this subpopulation&#160;(Trouwborst 2014).<br/><br/><strong>2. Western-Central Alps</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;is fully protected under the French, Italian and Swiss law. In France and Switzerland, the national Action Plans include provisions for legal take of a few wolves under strict conditions in response to damages on livestock. The three countries signed (2006) a formal agreement of cooperation for the management of the entire subpopulation, recognizing that the biological subpopulation&#160;needs to be managed through a common and accepted approach, but the agreement has not produced any concrete cooperation at the administrative or political levels. <br/><br/><strong>3. Italian peninsula</strong><br/>Fully protected by a national law, with damage compensation provided by 14 different regional laws. Compensation is paid for livestock lost to wolf predation, but the effectiveness of compensation programs has never been assessed and it is increasingly questioned. Apart from formal protection the subpopulation&#160;is not actively managed. The species occurs in several protected areas throughout its range but the size of these areas is far too small to protect any viable subpopulations. In spite of formal protection, illegal killings are estimated to take a substantial portion of the subpopulation&#160;every year (up to 15-20%). A national Action Plan setting the broad strategic ground for management has been under discussion for several years (2015-2017) but has not been approved because of disagreement between the national and regional governments (Boitani and Salvatori 2016). <br/><br/><strong>4. Dinaric-Balkan</strong><br/>Management is fragmented by multiple national laws. Most of the range is also outside the EU and therefore not bound by the protection of the Habitats Directive, although all range countries are now Bern Convention signatories. It is a game species in almost all countries, except for Slovenia, Croatia, Albania and Greece south of 39° latitude where wolves are fully protected. In Slovenia and Croatia, an effective Action Plan is in place and implemented (Štrbenac <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, <a href=""http://www.mop.gov.si/fileadmin/mop.gov.si/pageuploads/podrocja/velike_zveri/akcijski_nacrt_upravljanja_volk_2013_2017.pdf"">http://www.mop.gov.si/fileadmin/mop.gov.si/pageuploads/podrocja/velike_zveri/akcijski_nacrt_upravljanja_volk_2013_2017.pdf</a>) but no plans exists for any of the other countries. With the exception of Slovenia and Croatia, in general, law enforcement is weak or totally absent, institutions in several of the countries are not fully functional, there is very limited monitoring and research, and wildlife management structures for regulating hunter harvest of the prey base are poorly developed. There is a major need for investment in institution building in these countries.<br/><br/><strong>5. Carpathian</strong><br/>In Slovakia wolves are a game species with a hunting season; in Poland and the Czech Republic they are strictly protected by national laws; in Romania they are legally protected, but are managed as a de facto game species with hunting quotas decided yearly; in Ukraine wolves are neither a game species nor protected (often treated as “pest” species, with bounties of c.20 Euro per individual) (Salvatori <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is a need to improve monitoring, especially in Slovakia, and ensure that quotas and seasons are scaled with respect to realistic population estimates. <br/><br/><strong>6. Baltic</strong><br/>Wolves have been strictly protected in Poland since 1998, but are harvested in the three Baltic States (EU Habitats and Species Directive Appendix V) and in neighbouring Belarus and Ukraine. There is a new action plan for the conservation of the wolf in Latvia (2017). In all countries, there is a need to ensure that monitoring is effective at detecting trends in subpopulation&#160;development so that hunting quotas and seasons can be adjusted accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>7. Karelian</strong><br/>In Finland, wolves occurring in the reindeer herding area fall under Annex V of the Habitats Directive; those outside the reindeer herding area fall under Annex IV. Finland has a National Management Plan that includes removal of some wolves under controlled circumstances. In Russian Karelia, wolves are killed throughout the range and at any time. In spite of the small number of wolves, Finland has approved a plan to maintain the subpopulation&#160;within the maximum of 25 packs. The discontinuous flow of dispersing wolves from Russia allow a reasonable but cautiously positive forecast on the conservation of this subpopulation. Illegal killing of wolves remains a major problem in Finland. There are also widespread social and political conflicts that centre on wolf conservation.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Wolves are fully protected in Sweden and Norway; however, Norway applies both a zoning system and operates with very low management goal that restricts wolves to a small area (c. 5% of the country) along the border with Sweden and prevents population expansion. Both Norway and Sweden provide full compensation for damages. Both countries greatly restrict the presence of wolves in the reindeer herding areas that cover the northern part of the peninsula. The main issue for long-term viability of the subpopulation&#160;is inbreeding, which can only be improved by facilitating the movement of wolves through the northern reindeer herding areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Social and political conflicts around wolf management are intense.<br/><br/><strong>9. Central European</strong><br/>Wolves are functionally protected in all countries. In Germany, conservation is implemented by the local authority but there is a certain degree of coordination at the federal level. In Poland, wolves are strictly protected since 1995. The main threats stem from the intense social and political conflicts around wolf management.",Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

The Scandinavian part of the geographical European range is stable/increasing, but the population is small, about 800-1,000 individuals (not including cubs of the year; Eklund <em>et al.</em> 2017). The Scandinavian population is only narrowly connected with the Karelian population.<br/><br/><strong>2. Karelian</strong><br/>Endangered (EN). The Finnish part of the Karelian population is very small, about 200-250 individuals (all age classes; Luikko <em>et al.</em> 2016). There is no recent data available on the population size from the European part of Russia, but older data indicates higher density of wolverine in Russian Karelian than in eastern Finland (Danilov <em>et al.</em> 1996).","Wolverines inhabit a variety of habitats in the alpine, tundra, taiga, and boreal forest zones. They are found in coniferous, mixed, and deciduous woodlands, bogs, and open mountain and tundra habitats. Wolverines have evolved to scavenge from the kills of wild ungulates abandoned by more efficient predators such as wolves and lynx (Mattisson <em>et al.</em> 2016), as well as victims of accidents and disease. However, wolverines also prey on hares, rodents and occasionally animals as large as moose given certain snow conditions. They can also prey heavily on domestic sheep and semi-domesticated reindeer. The Wolverine has vast home ranges (Persson <em>et al.</em> 2009a) and good dispersal abilities (Vangen <em>et al.</em> 2001).","The threats are similar in the two populations. Human intolerance, which is used to justify lower conservation ambition in policies, is perhaps the greatest threat facing wolverines in Europe today.<br/>&#160;<br/>Predation on reindeer (Finland, Norway and Sweden) and sheep (Norway) are the most frequent damages that cause continuing debates about wolverine conservation and need to be addressed by livestock protection schemes and compensation systems (Landa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Hobbs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Tveraa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Zabel <em>et al. </em>2014, Mattisson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). The conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer need to be seen in a wider context of the challenges facing that industry, which include density-dependent food limitation, climate change, and loss of grazing areas due to infrastructure developments.<br/><br/>An emerging threat is climate change as wolverines are dependent on good snow conditions (deep snow that lasts long into springtime) for their natal dens (Copeland <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) and for food caches.<br/><br/>Poaching is also an important cause of mortality (Persson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, 2009b, 2015).","The European wolverine population is currently divided into two populations with some dispersal between them. During the 19th century, the wolverine population decreased, but the population has increased in both abundance and distribution during the 20th century. The total number of wolverine in the EU 28 is likely to be between 700 and 900 individuals, which correspond to about 400-600 reproductive individuals. The number of wolverine in the European part of Russia is unknown.<br/><br/><strong>1. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Population size: 800 - 1,000 wolverines (not including cubs of the year). The population has been fluctuating during the last ten years, in part due to lethal control (especially in Norway). It increased during the period from 2006 to 2012, and then has decreased in recent years.<br/><br/><strong>2. Karelian</strong><br/>Population size: The Finnish part: 200 - 250 wolverines (all age classes). The population appears to be increasing slowly.

The European wolverine population is divided into two populations, which can be described as follows (Chapron <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014):<br/><strong><br/>1. Scandinavian</strong><br/>The Scandinavian wolverines are found in mountainous areas along the spine of the Scandinavian peninsula. This includes extensive areas along the border between Sweden and Norway and also extends southwestwards and away from the border in the southern part of Norway. They are also expanding into boreal forest areas in the south as far as and including Dalarna and Värmland County in southern Sweden and Hedmark County in southern Norway. The main body of the population exists in the northern parts of Scandinavia, but the population is expanding southwards. The population extends further to the north within Finnmark County in Norway with an extension into the northwestern parts of Finland (Aronsson and Persson 2017, Eklund <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>2. Karelian</strong><br/>The Karelian wolverines are mainly found in central Finland and along the border with Russia. Wolverines are also found scattered all the way to the common borders with Norway and Sweden. Wolverines are found in the European part of Russia (west of the Urals) including Russian Karelia and Murmansk oblasts.

However, Norway manages wolverine as a de facto game species with annual quotas, set in relation to management objectives. These quotas are either filled by hunters in a specific season, or by state rangers using other means. In Sweden, wolverines are protected under Annex II of the habitat directive. Sweden and Norway provide full compensation of damages, with Sweden using a risk payment system for reindeer, whereas Norway pays ex post facto for both sheep and reindeer losses.<br/><br/><strong>2.

As suggested by Gärdenfors <em>et al.</em> (2001) and IUCN (2012): ""If the taxon is endemic to the region or the regional population is isolated, the Red List Category defined by the criteria should be adopted unaltered. If, on the other hand, conspecific populations outside the region are judged to affect the regional extinction risk, the regional Red List Category should be changed to a more appropriate level that reflects the extinction risk as defined by criterion E (IUCN 2001, 2012).

Several populations are assessed under category D (isolated and small number of mature individuals). For purposes here, mature individuals are assumed to represent 55% of the total population, and an isolated population is defined as one that has less than one female immigrant per generation (10 years). Such information is unavailable for many populations but, based on knowledge of female Brown Bear dispersal rates and distances (Swenson <em>et al.</em> 1998), it is possible to estimate the degree of isolation for populations where data on bear movements are absent.&#160;</p><p>Brown Bears in portions of northeastern Europe (Karelian and Baltic) are connected to the large North Eurasian population (≈100,000) that spreads across Russia. Other populations are smaller and isolated. All populations except two (Central Apennine - Abruzzi and Cantabrian) are shared among two or more countries. Population-level management across national borders has been generally accepted; however, the implementation of this concept is far from satisfactory, especially in countries not implementing their own national plans. Agreements between countries include various degrees of coordinated-management (France with Spain, Greece with Bulgaria, Slovenia with Croatia, Sweden with Norway), sharing information (Sweden and Norway, Croatia, Slovenia Italy and Austria), or most commonly, working groups have been established among scientists or managers. However, in no case is there a formal population level management plan as outlined in Linnell <em>et al.</em> (2008).</p><p></p>  <p><strong>Description of ten Brown Bear populations in Europe (see table attached)</strong></p>  <p></p><ul><li><u>Alpine<br/></u>In 2016, an estimated slightly increasing population of 41‒69 bears lived in 4 countries in an area of approximately 12,200 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of the Alps of Italia (Trentino, Veneto and Friuli provinces) 49-66, Switzerland 1-3, Austria 0-4, and Slovenia: 5-8. The most important potential connection is with the Dinaric-Pindos population in Slovenia. A few male bears have been shown to move between these two populations in both directions. Initiatives to coordinate and harmonize bear management between Italy, Switzerland, Austria and even Germany are currently underway. However, food conditioning and/or habituated bears remain a management challenge. Low social tolerance to even minor bear-caused damages to property and perceived risks to public safety have led to the sanctioned killing of 3 recent immigrant bears in Germany (1) and Switzerland (2), as well as in Italy (Trento) (2). Red List Category: CR - Criteria: D1.</li><li><u>Central Apennine<br/></u>Located mostly in Abruzzi area in Italy, a population of 45‒69 bears is spread over 6,400 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Gervasi <em>et al.</em> 2012). This small population appears to have been stable or slightly increasing over the last decade but has been isolated for over a century with no possibility to reestablish connectivity. Occasional losses due to poaching or other human-related accidents occur and the population has not increased in size despite regular reproduction. Red List Category: CR.Criteria: D1.</li><li><u>Eastern Balkans<br/></u>Mostly in Bulgaria in three segments with about 421 bears, but also in Greece and Serbia with about 42 (25-98) and 3-5 bears, respectively, this population occupies about 39,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The population is considered stable with 613 (468-665) bears although the estimates fluctuate as the assessment methods improved (Ministry of Environment and Waters 2008, Zlatanova<em> et al.</em> 2009). The Greek part of the Rila-Rhodope segment is near the Dinaric-Pindos population and only recently the first evidence on a possible connection between these two populations has been demonstrated (Pylidis 2015). To the north of the Stara-Planina segment there is a potential, but unproven connection to the Carpathian population. Within the Eastern Balkans the main challenge is to maintain connections among the three segments of this population. Bulgaria has developed a new bear management plan and controversies seem to have diminished. In Greece habitat fragmentation mainly due to motorways remains a conservation concern.

These bears appear to be connected with bears in the Russian Federation. Here they are separated into their own population for administrative reasons, and also to produce units of practical size with more homogeneous ecological and management conditions. Due to their connection with bears in Russia and Belarus these populations are large and occupy a large area safeguarding their favourable conservation status. However, the lack of reliable and regular information from Russia or Belarus makes it difficult to assess changes in population size or range. Red List Category: LC.</li><li><u>Cantabrian<br/></u>Totally isolated for over a century, this population of about 328 bears occupies 7,700 km<sup>2</sup> of northwestern Spain. It is subdivided into a western segment that shows an obvious increase (from 3 females with cubs in 1994 to 40 in 2016), whereas the eastern segment is possibly stable but there are few females with offspring (females with cubs are used as an index of population size). Red List Category: EN. Criteria: D1.</li><li><u>Carpathian<br/></u>With about 7,630 bears, this is the second largest of European populations (considering Karelian with NE Europe), and is shared among five countries: Romania (5,850-6,300), Poland (about 100), Serbia North (8-10), Slovakia (1,034-1,489), and Ukraine (about 320), within an area of 122,600 km<sup>2</sup>. Brown Bears are only occasionally recorded in Hungary and the Czech Republic. The closest next population is in northern Bulgaria and southeastern Serbia, but the movement of individual bears may be very restricted due to the Danube, which acts as a physical barrier. Due to a lack of knowledge about the situation within Ukraine, the connection between the Romanian bears with those in the Slovak-Polish Carpathians is uncertain. There is already an important gap along the Slovak-Polish border between the western and eastern parts of the northern Carpathian range where human infrastructures isolate the bears in western Slovakia. That linkage zone is occasionally visited by dispersing males, but no reproduction has been documented so far. Furthermore, the bears in the Apuseni Mountains in Romania are tenuously connected with the rest of Romanian Carpathians and the recent development of transportation infrastructure may cut them off completely. Red List Category: LC (assuming some bears cross the various barriers).</li><li><u>Dinaric-Pindos<br/></u>This ~3,940 bear population is shared by nine countries, with an extent of occurrence of 115,300 km<sup>2</sup>: Slovenia (564), Croatia (937), Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (1,000), Montenegro (378), The Former Yugoslav Republic of (FYRO) Macedonia (375), Albania (190), Serbia (120), Kosovo: (unknown) and Greece (450-500). The northern portion of this population is close to the Alpine population; bears in the Italian Alps and Slovenia are weakly connected by male dispersers. However, there is not a continuous distribution of female bears within the Alps. Historical connections with the Carpathian population through Serbia and with the Eastern Balkans through the FYRO Macedonia are broken. In Slovenia, human‒bear conflicts are making it a challenge to allow for the spreading of the population into the Alps. With Croatia entering the EU, the status of bears was changed from “game species” to “fully protected”. Hunting is now termed 'culling' and is justified under the EU derogation regulation, which has weakened hunters’ support for bear management (<a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN"">Habitat Directive</a>). This population is shared by many countries and subject to widely varying monitoring methods and standards.&#160;There is a general lack of information from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo and the FYRO Macedonia. There is no monitoring and no management plans in these countries. There appears to be limited or even no connectivity among portions of this population in Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo and the FYRO Macedonia dividing the population into likely subpopulations, some of which continue to decline. There is a high likelihood of increased fracturing of this population and continued decline in important portions of the distribution. Red List Category: VU. Criteria: C2a(i).</li><li><u>Karelian<br/></u>About 1,660 bears are shared by Finland (1,780) and northern Norway (35) within 381,500 km<sup>2</sup>. The Karelian population likely has some genetic exchange with the Scandinavian population to the south and west. This population is linked to the Baltic bear population via the large continental North Eurasian population (&gt;100,000 bears) with bears in Belarus and Russia. Being part of this large population enhances their conservation status. However, the lack of reliable and regular information from Belarus or Russia makes it difficult to assess population or range changes.

It has been totally isolated for over a century, and divided into western and central segments, with little interchange among these. The last female of Pyrenean ancestry died in 2004, leaving the western segment with no females. The central segment has been growing since reintroductions from Slovenia in 1996–1997, 2006 and 2016, but genetically these are not Pyrenean bears. There is no possibility of re-establishing connectivity to any other population in the short term, but future reintroductions are planned in the&#160;western Pyrenees. Some losses due to poaching or other human-related accidents still occur. Red List Category: CR. Criteria: D1.</li><li><u>Scandinavian<br/></u>The bulk of this population resides in Sweden (2,782 bears) and the rest in south-central Norway (35), within 466,700 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kindberg <em>et al. </em>2011). The population is potentially connected with the Karelian population through dispersing males, but probably not females. The major pressure in Norway remains to the issue of damages to unguarded free-ranging sheep. This chronic conflict has led to parliament setting very low population targets goals for recovery. Although conflicts have been low in Sweden, new conflicts are appearing as bears expand into more densely populated areas to the south and as Swedish authorities have become more liberal in allowing the killing of bears on the calving grounds of domestic reindeer. However, generally, the bear is well accepted and managed in Sweden. In the national Red Lists, the Brown Bear is listed as NT in Sweden and EN in Norway, both based on the D1 criterion. Red List Category: NT. Although conflicts have been low in Sweden, new conflicts are appearing as bears expand into more densely populated areas to the south. However, generally, the bear is well accepted and managed in Sweden. Red List Category: LC.</li></ul><p></p>","<p>The original distribution of the Brown Bear in Europe illustrates its adaptability to different environmental conditions. With little or no human interference, Brown Bears occupied not only forests, but also steppes and tundra. Today, most of the bear' s former range is no longer suitable habitat due to human habitat alteration and human presence. Components of habitat can be grouped into three main categories: food, escape cover, and den sites. Bear movements and habitat use are strongly affected by the availability of food. Furthermore, population density is positively associated with food availability. Areas with a high availability of preferred foods, such as berries, fruits, hard mast, colonial Hymenoptera, and ungulates, are of special importance to Brown Bears.<br/> <br/><strong> 1. Cantabrian</strong><br/>The Cantabrian subpopulation inhabits the Cantabrian Mountains, which are partly covered with mixed deciduous forest.<br/> <br/><strong>2.

Karelia and Northeastern Europe</strong><br/>The habitat is dominated by intensively exploited boreal forest.</span></p>","<p>Bears have a low reproductive rate and are vulnerable to human-related mortality. They require large habitats that make them vulnerable to changes in land use. In Eastern Europe, land use once under centralised state administration has reverted to private ownership, often with no knowledge of wildlife management. Land use developments have tended to follow western examples with more intensive use of productive areas. The best bear habitat has already disappeared in Europe through logging and forest clearance. The planting of exotic conifers has seriously altered local ecosystems in some places. Habitat fragmentation, particularly as a result of road construction, presents serious problems for a species requiring such large areas. Mortality caused by high-speed road and rail networks through bear habitat is a major threat in some areas including Greece and Croatia. Poaching remains a threat to many, but not all populations, and takes place irrespective of population size. Females with cubs, as well as males, are liable to be killed. Poaching has probably worsened in 1990s in countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, and FYR Macedonia as a result of declining economic and social conditions but seems to be less in the last decade.&#160;Poaching in Russia, to supply the lucrative market for bear parts in Asian countries, is a particular problem. Five very small, isolated bear populations in southern and western Europe (located in France, Spain and Italy), are highly threatened by their small population size. They could easily become extinct as a result of random fluctuations.<br/> <br/><strong> 1. Cantabrian</strong><br/>The main pressure is the loss of adult individuals due to human-induced mortality. <br/> <br/><strong>2. Pyrenees</strong><br/>The main pressure is the loss of adult individuals due to killing by humans. Increasing inbreeding and small effective size of the population are other threats for the long term.<br/> <br/><strong>3. Alps</strong><br/>Damages done by bears have the potential to reduce the public acceptance of this species, and of trouble-making individuals in particular. Intensive management of all bear-related problems is underway. Despite the constant increase of the Central Italian nucleus, the limited numbers of individuals characterizing all the Alpine nuclei show that all these are Critically Endangered. The loss of more than 15 bears from the central Austrian bear population and two dispersers from Italy suggest an unnatural high mortality rate of bears in the Alps. Unfortunately, illegal removals seems to be the most likely explanation.<br/> <br/><strong>4. Apennine Mountains</strong><br/>The main pressure is the loss of adult individuals due to human-induced mortality. The population is critically endangered. The bear population has been totally isolated for over a century, thus there may be genetic problems.<br/> <br/><strong>5. Dinara-Pindos</strong><br/>Political instability and the lack of human capacity, as well as financial instruments, represent a pressure in the central part of the range including h<span lang=""EN-GB"">uman-induced mortality, habitat fragmentation and disruption and degradation due to infrastructure development.<br/> <br/><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>The socio-economic developments in Romania and to varying degrees in other countries have an influence on bear population on medium- and long-term and it is considered that the parts of this bear population are vulnerable.<br/> <br/><strong>7. Balkan</strong><br/> <span lang=""EN-GB"">Human-induced mortality, habitat fragmentation and disruption and degradation due to infrastructure development Presently in Bulgaria there is liberal (poorly functioning) system of declaring the problem individuals assigned for removal, as well as poorly controlled poaching.<br/> <br/><strong>8.

Karelia and northeastern Europe</strong><br/>Due to a large total population size and large area, the population is in favourable conservation status.</span></p>","Brown Bears originally occurred throughout Europe (except the largest islands such as Ireland, Iceland, Gotland, Corsica and Sardinia), but later disappeared from most areas as the human population grew, suitable habitat was lost due to deforestation and agriculture, and the species was persecuted by humans. Today the total number of Brown Bears in Europe is about 55,000 bears (c.15,000-20,000 outside Russia) which occur within an area of more than 2.5 million km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(800,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;outside Russia). These bears are found in two large (&gt;5,000), three medium (500-2,500), one small (100-500), and four very small (&lt;100) subpopulations.<br/><br/><strong>1. Cantabrian<br/></strong>The two Cantabrian subpopulations apparently have been separated since the beginning of the century and now show genetic differences. Today, they are separated by 30-50 km of mountainous terrain and interchange between the populations is thought to be unlikely, mainly due to unsuitable habitat and a high-speed railway and motorway. In the Western Cantabrian Mountains, the population seems to be stable or increasing in the last decade and is distributed over an area of 2,600 km<sup>2</sup>. The most recent estimate using genetic methods (García-Garitagoitia <em>et al.</em> 2004) calculated 85-143 bears for the western nucleus, with an average number of 107. In the eastern Cantabrian Mountains, the subpopulation shows less potential for recovery, unless the corridor with the western portion is reestablished. The total population for both Cantabrian nuclei may be approximately 328 bears; not all of these are mature individuals.<br/><br/><strong>2. Pyrenees</strong><br/>The autochthonous western subpopulation was estimated to consist of three individuals. The last documented reproductions occurred in 1998, 2000 and 2004. In 2006 the reintroduction action provided five (4F, 1M) bears from Slovenia mostly to the&#160;central area. In 2016 an adult male was translocated from Slovenia to the&#160;central Pyrenees. The autochthonous central population was gone before the last decade of 20th century. In 1996-1997 three bears were reintroduced from Slovenia. There was subsequent reproduction, including one male dispersal to the western Pyrenees. Until recently the Western and Central Pyrenees were treated as separate units. With the dispersal of one male bear from the central to the western&#160;portion, the connectivity is now re-established. The local bears have been totally isolated for over one century and had low genetic diversity. The recent reintroductions have resulted in the influx of new genes.<br/><br/><strong>3. Alps</strong><br/>The Central Austrian subpopulation consists of about &lt;10 bears ten years ago. After increases following reintroductions and local reproductions, in recent years numbers have declined again and by 2016 all vanished. No more than four autochthonous bears survived in north-eastern Italy until ten were reintroduced from Slovenia in 1999-2003. With subsequent reproduction, the subpopulation in 2016 exceeded 50 bears, and continues to grow.<br/><br/>Several individuals from the Trentino nuclei dispersed into Austria, Switzerland and Germany. This demonstrates the connectivity of the habitat within the Alps and the potential for recolonization. One bear was legally shot in Germany in July 2006 because of the potential threat it posed to human safety (the bear repeatedly entered villages and broke into barns). For the same reason, two bears were shot in Switzerland in 2008 and 2013, respectively. Occasionally individuals dispersing from the eastern Alpine nucleus have reached the central Italian Alps, confirming a potential connectivity among all the alpine nuclei.<br/><br/><strong>4. Apennine Mountains</strong><br/>An estimate yielded a figure of 70-80 bears in 1985. However, since then there has probably been a population decrease and in 2016 the 50 bears is a realistic estimate. Some expect this subpopulation to increase as poaching has been reduced in recent years, and areas surrounding Abruzzi National Park have been protected to secure suitable habitats. However, this population exists within a densely human populated area and there are potential conflicts between bear conservation and development and recreation activities.<br/><br/><strong>5. Dinara-Pindos</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;seems to be genetically very close to the remnant bears in the Alps. The subpopulation overall has been more or less stable in recent years. However, trends vary in different areas, with steady growth in Slovenia and stable in Croatia. After a marked drop in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s due to the war, the subpopulation segment there may be recovering. The trend is probably stable or slightly decreasing trends in the south of the Dinarids, whereas in Pindos range it is characterized as growing (450-500) with local recolonization of the former range. The population size estimate of 3,940 is based on weak supporting evidence. Approximately half (1,800) of these individuals are mature. The population trend data is likewise based on little quantitative data and it is possible that the trend is stable rather than growing. In countries with bear hunting, there might be a political tendency for overestimation to justify higher quotas. In Slovenia in the north, this population is close to that of the Alps. There is not a continuous distribution of female bears in the Alps, but there is movement of male bears. In Greece in the south, the nearest bears are those of the Rila-Rhodope portion of the Balkan population along the border of Greece and Bulgaria, but there is no evidence of connection.<br/><br/><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>The Carpathian Mountains subpopulation&#160;is estimated at about 7,630 bears and is the second largest in Europe. Recent estimates of the Romanian subpopulation&#160;indicate that in Romania about 6,000 bears occur, the population trend being stable. The highest bear densities are found in the areas of Brasov, Harghita, Covasna, Mures, Bistrita, Arges, Vrancea and Sibiu counties (central part of the Romanian Carpathians). During the last 50 years, the Romanian bear subpopulation recovered from less than 1,000 individuals to about 6,000 individuals. This recovery process was influenced by both habitat conditions and wildlife management. However, recent developments (e.g. infrastructure developments) have had negative impacts on bears. Problems include behavioural changes (habituated bears), habitat fragmentation and reproductive isolation. Several areas (corridor between Apuseni Mountains and the main ridge of Carpathians, Prahova Valley, southern part of Carpathians - close to the&#160;Danube) have started to be affected by isolation processes, but there is still connectivity within the entire Romanian Carpathian subpopulation. Some dispersers from this subpopulation have entered the Czech Republic and Hungary. The next closest subpopulation&#160;is in northern Bulgaria and north-eastern Serbia, but the migration of individual bears may be very restricted, as the Danube is a major physical barrier.<br/><br/><strong>7. Balkans</strong><br/>The subpopulation consists of two segments: Rila-Rhodope Mountains (about 350 bears) and Stara Planina Mountains (65-109 bears). The connections between subpopulations were recently proven, and there may be signs of recolonisation. In the early eighties, Carpathian bears were released in Rhodope and Stara Planina Mountains. The numbers are not known since there is restricted access to the data.<br/><br/><strong>8. Scandinavia</strong><br/>After heavy persecution in both countries, the once numerous Brown Bear subpopulation in Scandinavia was reduced to about 130 individuals in four areas where they have survived since 1930. The population has increased to about 3,300 in 2008 in Sweden, with approximately 40 bears in Norway. Male bears may disperse between neighbouring female core areas, but when considering demographic viability they should be considered to be&#160;separated. This population consists of three subpopulations. In Sweden, the distribution of bears now resembles that of 1800, with bears occurring in 67% or more of the country. The population is one of the most productive in the world and is increasing at a rate of about 5.5% annually. This population is viable, both genetically and demographically, but low gene flow has been identified between the southernmost subpopulation and the other subpopulations. The population is connected with the north-eastern European population through dispersing males, but probably not by dispersing females. The increase of hunting rate in the last decade decreased the population to 2,782 bears in 2013.<br/><br/><strong>9. Karelia and Northeastern Europe</strong><br/>Densities are generally low, with the highest densities in the south-eastern part of the range and the lowest densities in the north and southwest. The total population size occurring west of 35 degrees east is estimated at c.38,000 individuals. This population is connected with the Scandinavian one.",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of North America, including Mexico, throughout Europe, Asia, and even into several countries in North Africa. It presently ranges across parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, with the largest numbers in Russia, Alaska, and Canada. Subpopulations in Europe are highly fragmented, and some are extremely small and isolated. Details of the European subpopulations are given below (following LCIE 2007):<br/> <br/><strong>1. Cantabrian</strong><br/>Presently there are two bear nuclei in the Cantabrian Mountains in Spain. They are defined as the western and eastern portions.<br/> <br/><strong>2. Pyrenees</strong><br/>Western Pyrenees: the Western Pyrenean Brown Bear subpopulation is found in a 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> area located on both sides of the national border between France and Spain in the western portion of the Pyrenees Mountain Range. However, only about one half of this area is used regularly.<br/><br/>Central Pyrenees: the Central Pyrenean Brown Bear subpopulation is on both sides of the national border between France and Spain in the central portion of the Pyrenees Mountain Range including Andorra.<br/> <br/><strong>3. Alps</strong><br/>Presently there used to be three bear nuclei in the Alps. In Central Austria there was a small nucleus originated from three bears released in 1989-1993, into an area with a naturally occurring male bear. However, this nucleus vanished during the last ten years. Another nucleus is located in the Central Italian Alps, centred in the province of Trento. This nucleus (49-66 individuals, all originated from the animals translocated in the 1999-2003 period) occupies an area of about 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>, of which only 240 km<sup>2</sup> is used regularly. A third nucleus of bears is present in the Eastern Alps (Slovenia. Italy, Austria), and originated from individuals that arrived naturally from the Dinara-Pindos subpopulation. This nucleus is estimated at ten individuals and has a clear male bias.<br/> <br/><strong>4. Apennine Mountains</strong><br/>The subpopulation is located in Abruzzi National Park and the surrounding area in the Apennine Mountains in Italy.</p><p> <br/><strong>5. Dinara-Pindos</strong><br/>This subpopulation consists of Brown Bears in the forested areas extending from the Dinara range in Slovenia in the north through Pindos Mountains in Greece in the south. The countries involved are Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, FYR Macedonia, Albania, and Greece. The forested areas in these countries are less contiguous than in the Carpathian area, separating to some degree the functional habitat into more or less isolated sub areas, although there are corridors.</p><p> <br/><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>The Carpathian subpopulation includes the Brown Bears in Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Serbia and Romania. The Carpathian Mountains population is the second largest in Europe. The bears are widely distributed within the entire Romanian Carpathian Mountains range, starting from hilly areas and extending to sub-alpine habitats. Bears in Romania occur permanently or sporadically across a total area of 62,000 km<sup>2</sup>, of which about 44,000 km<sup>2</sup> are forested.</p><p> <br/><strong>7. Balkan</strong><br/>The Rila-Rhodope area is located in south-western Bulgaria and north-eastern Greece. It includes the three connected subpopulations in the Bulgarian Rila Mountains and Pirin Mountains and the subpopulation in the western Rhodope Mountains on both sides of the national border. Of the total population of about 520 bears, only about 42 are found in Greece. The connection between the bears in Greece and Bulgaria is likely to consist of dispersing males from Bulgaria, as well as of family groups seasonally dispersing from Greece into Bulgaria.<br/> <br/>The Stara Planina subpopulation is located from Kotlenska mountain in the east to Zlatitsa-Teteven in the west, along a 120 km stretch of the Stara Planina Mountains (Balkan Range). The western end extends into Serbia and a few bears are shared over the border. The Stara Planina subpopulation was believed to be isolated from the populations to the south and west but there is recent evidence of bears in the corridors to the south towards Rila-Rhodopean Mountains, including family groups.<br/> <br/><strong>8. Scandinavia</strong><br/>The subpopulation&#160;is shared between Sweden and Norway, but much more than 95% of the individuals are in Sweden. In Norway, the bears are found mostly along the Swedish border and most individuals are dispersing young males from Sweden. The delineation is along the Swedish-Finnish border, and further north through Norway. Bears in Norway east of this line are in Karelian and northeastern Europe subpopulation. The area between the Scandinavian and northeastern Europe subpopulations is very sparsely inhabited by bears.<br/> <br/><strong>9. Karelia and northeastern Europe</strong><br/>The North-eastern European subpopulation is the largest continuous Brown Bear subpopulation in Europe. Its range stretches from the Ural Mountains in the east (continuous with the bears on the east side of the mountains making it the largest Brown Bear subpopulation in the world) to the west coast of Finland and the Baltic. It ranges from 53° N in the south to 69° N in the north. This subpopulation includes bears in north-easternmost Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus.</p>",The species is sometimes hunted for sport.,Terrestrial,"<p>Since 1992, all Brown Bear populations have been listed on either Appendix I or Appendix II of CITES. In the EU, all populations are listed in Annex A of the European Union Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97, that implements CITES in the member states (Knapp 2006). The Brown Bear is included on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex II (except Finnish and Swedish populations) and Annex IV of the EU Habitats &amp; Species Directive. Most European range states have national Brown Bear management plans.<br/> <br/>General conservation recommendations include the following: Key bear areas and corridors need to be sufficiently managed and protected. Farmers need to be encouraged to use traditional livestock guarding techniques to reduce conflict arising from livestock depredation. Public awareness and education is also needed to inform people in bear areas about bear behaviour and ecology. International and national legislation protecting bears from poaching should be enforced. More research into population dynamics, genetics and bear habitat is also required to carry out work in bear action plans.<br/> <br/><strong> 1. Cantabrian</strong><br/>The Cantabrian population is strictly protected but occasional losses due to poaching or other human-related accidents do occur (snares set by poachers for Wild Boars).<br/> <br/><strong> 2. Pyrenees</strong><br/>The species is strictly protected but occasional losses due to poaching or other human-related accidents do occur.<br/> <br/><strong>3. Alps</strong><br/>The Italian and Austrian bear nuclei are under strict protection; in Slovenia, a regulated harvest policy is in place. The removal of the bear in Germany caused a great public outcry and quite a controversy between different national and international GOs and NGOs. Fortunately, the case also raised awareness for the need of a bear management on the population level. Initiatives to coordinate and harmonize bear management between Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and Germany are underway.<br/> <br/><strong>4. Apennine Mountains</strong><br/>It is strictly protected but occasional losses due to poaching or other human-related accidents do occur.<br/> <br/><strong>5. Dinara-Pindos</strong><br/>In the largest part of this population's range (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Macedonia) the bear is a game species. In Slovenia and Croatia, the Brown Bear is hunted under status protected by Habitat Directive. In Albania and Greece, it is strictly protected. Additionally, in Greece, it is considered as a priority species under the EU Habitat Directive 92/43.<br/> <br/><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>Whereas in Romania and Slovakia bears are a hunted species, in other countries, they are harvested under various regimes, mostly related to the damage control system (but protected in Poland). Annually, in Romania, up to 250 bears are hunted (about 4% of the estimated population), but since 2017 all bear hunting has been suspended. In 2005 a national bear management plan was approved by the authorities, its implementation being started by the Ministry of Environment and Water Management together with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development. One of the first initiated actions was related to population surveys of larger areas (geographical criteria) and setting up hunting quotas based on the analysis at the national level. Compensation for damages caused by bears is paid by the game administrators, and it is foreseen that in areas where bears are not hunted these compensations will be paid by the Ministry of Environment and Water Management (the authority for protected species).<br/> <br/><strong>7. Balkan</strong><br/>Bears in Bulgaria are under protected status that allows the removal of problem individuals. The Greek portion is strictly protected, as well as are the few specimens in Serbia.<br/> <br/><strong>8. Scandinavia</strong><br/>There is a quota hunting regime in Sweden. The harvest rate allowed the further and steady population growth until it was increased to reverse the trend. In Norway only damage causing bears are removed, but such a reduction is technically sustainable only due to the influx of individuals from Sweden.<br/> <br/><strong>9. Northeastern Europe</strong><br/>Bears are game animals in most of this population range under various quota systems.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

There are 8,000-9,000 lynx (number of individuals) present in Europe&#160;excluding&#160;Russia and Belarus (LCIE in prep., Chapron<em> et al.</em> 2014) and this number has been stable since the last regional assessment in 2007. The European subpopulation doubles to 17,000-18,000 individuals when taking European Russia into account where in 2013 roughly 9,200 lynx were estimated (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl) and with help of V.V. Rozhnov 2014). Consequently, the species is classed as Least Concern at the European level.</p>  <p>The lynx population within the EU Member States remains small. With an estimated 7,000-8,000 total individuals it is below the population size threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion C (10,000 mature individuals). It does currently not meet the subcriteria, though. However, some of the larger subpopulations (Scandinavian and Baltic) have shown declining trends in the past decade and if this trend persists, the lynx population within the EU could meet Criterion C1 in the near future. Consequently, it is assessed as Near Threatened at the EU level.</p>  <p>Continued conservation measures are required to ensure the recovery of the species. This is particularly true for the Critically Endangered Balkan lynx subspecies, but also for the reintroduced populations in Western and Central Europe (Alpine, Vosges-Palatinian, Jura, Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian, Dinaric) which are still small and are classified as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Additionally, the recent negative trends in some of the larger autochthonous subpopulations (Scandinavian and Baltic) have to be reversed.</p>  <p>Note: The assessment of the subpopulations is mainly based on total population size (number of lynx individuals) or number of independent individuals (adults and subadults, based on capture-recapture estimates by means of camera trap surveys extrapolated to the distribution area of the subpopulation) as these are the estimates usually available from the range countries. The number of mature individuals is, however, lower than these numbers, which was taken into account when assessing the Category.</p>  <p><strong>1. Jura</strong><br/>Endangered (D). Lynx numbers in the Jura Mts. have increased to c.140 independent individuals and the range has expanded. It however still qualifies as Endangered under Criterion D because the subpopulation size is below 250 mature individuals. In recent years, a few male lynx from the Jura Mts. have dispersed to neighbouring regions (e.g. the Black Forest in Germany). However, there is too limited immigration of lynx from neighbouring subpopulations, e.g. the Alps, into the Jura subpopulation to provide a sufficient demographic rescue effect. Therefore, the Red List Category is not adjusted for connectivity.</p>  <p><strong>2. Vosges-Palatinian</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (C1, D). The Vosges-Palatinian subpopulation is on the verge of extinction. Numbers had dropped from 30-40 lynx in 2005 to 1-3 ten years later which is a reduction of 91% (CR Criterion C1 (25% reduction in 4 years) in addition to Criterion D for the very small population size). Since 2011, two individuals have been detected in camera-trap surveys and one collared individual from the EU LIFE project ""Reintroduction of lynx in the biosphere reserve Palatinian Forest"" has been observed in France. In the frame of this EU LIFE project, a few individuals are being released into the Palatinian Forest in Germany. Nine individuals were released in 2016-2017, with a total of 20 lynx&#160;planned to be released. However, as the reintroduction only started in 2016 and there was a continuing decline throughout the years before, Critically Endangered under Criteria C and D is still considered valid. There is so far too limited immigration from the Jura Mts. to provide a demographic rescue effect.</p>  <p><strong>3. Alpine</strong><br/>Endangered (D). The subpopulation has slightly increased to c. 163 individuals, which is however still small and the subpopulation&#160;remains Endangered. In addition, the increase was partly due to the foundation of stepping stone subpopulations through translocations of lynx. So far the subpopulation is not receiving any relevant immigration from neighbouring subpopulations&#160;which are all also small and having conservation problems themselves (e.g. Dinaric subpopulation). The Alpine subpopulation&#160;itself is fragmented into four smaller subpopulations in the Western and Eastern Alps. Consequently, the Red List Category is not adjusted.</p>  <p><strong>4. Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (D). The distribution of the Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian subpopulation&#160;has stagnated since the late 1990s (Magg <em>et al. </em>2016). The subpopulation has decreased from an estimated 75 individuals in 2005 to c.50 individuals in 2006-2011. In the past few years, it has slightly recovered to 60-80 independent individuals in 2015 and numbers seem to stabilize. 60-80 independent individuals correspond to about 45-60 mature individuals, which is just around the threshold (50 mature individuals) for Endangered under Criterion D. Considering the previous long-term negative trend and that limiting factors have not yet been reversed (Magg <em>et al.</em> 2016) suggests however a precautionary approach (thus taking into account the lower population estimate of less than 50 mature individuals) and classification as Critically Endangered. Neighbouring lynx subpopulations are small and threatened, and there are barriers to dispersal, consequently, no rescue effect from them can be expected and the Red List Category is not adjusted.<br/> <br/><strong>5. Dinaric</strong><br/>Endangered (D). The subpopulation&#160;size in total has been rather stable in the past decade at around 130 individuals, however, it has decreased in the northern part of its range. Besides a high level of human-caused mortality (Sindicic <em>et al</em>. 2016), problems of inbreeding have been noticed due to the very few founder individuals released in 1973 (Sindicic <em>et al.</em> 2013). The subpopulation is isolated and no rescue effect can be expected. It is assessed as Endangered under Criterion D. Efforts are on the way to reinforce the subpopulation with lynx from the Carpathians in the frame of the EU LIFE project “<a href=""https://www.lifelynx.eu/"">Preventing the Extinction of the Dinaric-SE Alpine Lynx Population Through Reinforcement and Long-term Conservation</a>“).</p>  <p><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>Least Concern. The Carpathians host one of the largest continuous lynx subpopulations&#160;in Europe. The overall number is about 2,100-2,400. Overall it appears to be rather stable, although in certain regions numbers have decreased, either reflecting a real trend (e.g. Ukraine and Bulgaria) or due to better monitoring systems in place which proved that previous numbers were overestimated (e.g. Slovakia, Kubala <em>et al. </em>2017). When considering the number of mature individuals, the threshold for Near Threatened under Criterion D is almost met. A careful monitoring of the situation (which requires the implementation of better monitoring systems in many of the range countries) and a re-assessment within a few years are recommended.</p>  <p><strong>7. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Vulnerable (C1). The Scandinavian subpopulation&#160;has a large range (AOO over 450,000 km²) but has further declined in numbers in the past decade. It is now estimated at c.1,300-1,800 individuals compared to c.1,800-2,300 in 2011 and c.2,000 in 2001. The drastic decline, which is at least in part due to a management goal designed to reduce conflicts related to sheep and semi-domestic reindeer depredation, would qualify for classifying the subpopulation as Endangered under Criterion C1 (less than 2,500 mature individuals and a 20% decline over two generations). However, in 2015 and 2016, the decline was halted. There is some connectivity with the Karelian subpopulation and single individuals are likely to disperse. The Category is therefore altered to Vulnerable. The extent of this connectivity and the phylogeny of these two subpopulations, however, need some further investigation. A careful monitoring of the situation, an adaptive adjustment of hunting quotas and derogations, and a re-assessment within a few years are highly recommended.</p>  <p><strong>8. Karelian</strong><br/>Least Concern. The subpopulation in Finland has further increased and is now estimated c.2,500 individuals (compared to 1,100 animals in 2004). Although there is no up-to-date information from Russian Karelia, the overall subpopulation is also thought to be stable there. It is furthermore connected with the large neighbouring subpopulation&#160;in Russia from which a potential rescue effect is to be expected. Therefore, the Karelian subpopulation&#160;is assessed as Least Concern.</p>  <p><strong>9. Baltic</strong><br/>Least Concern. The subpopulation consists of around 1,200-1,500 individuals, without considering Russia and Belarus for which no current information is available. Although there was a slight decrease – particularly in Estonia (probably due to the effect of prey declines following snow-rich winters) – this subpopulation&#160;is connected both to the Karelian and the larger Asian Russian subpopulation from which a potential rescue effect can be expected. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern. Developments in the Baltic States and Poland, however, need to be carefully surveyed as the distribution area in this part of the range is still fragmented. A further reduction in Estonia has to be prevented.</p>  <p><strong>10. Balkan</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (D). This subpopulation consists of&#160;only&#160;20-39 mature individuals and has been assessed as Critically Endangered in 2015 (Melovski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Number and distribution have not changed since, and the population is isolated. Therefore, Critically Endangered under Criterion D is still valid.</p>  <p><strong>11. Harz</strong><br/>Critically Endangered (D). This population has been newly founded through re-introduction of lynx into the Harz Mountains in Germany. Formerly treated as an “occurrence”, it is now considered a subpopulation. Between 2000 and 2006, 24 lynx were reintroduced into the Harz National Park in Lower Saxony. Since 2002, reproduction is regularly recorded (<a href=""https://www.luchsprojekt-harz.de/luchsprojekt/de/start/"">https://www.luchsprojekt-harz.de/luchsprojekt/de/start/</a>). It is currently estimated at 46 independent individuals, is isolated, and qualifies for Critically Endangered under Criterion D (below 50 mature individuals).</p>","<p>Throughout Europe and Siberia, the Eurasian Lynx is primarily associated with forested areas which have good ungulate populations and which provide enough cover for hunting. It inhabits extended, temperate and boreal forests from the Atlantic in Western Europe to the Pacific coast in the Russian Far East (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). In Europe, it can be found in Mediterranean forests up to the transition zone of taiga to tundra and lives from sea level up to the tree line (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). In the far north of Scandinavia lynx can also make extensive use of open alpine tundra habitats.</p>  <p>The Eurasian lynx is the largest species in the <em>Lynx </em>genus, and the only one to primarily depend on ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller species where ungulates are less abundant. Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smaller ungulate species, such as roe deer and chamois. Occasionally, lynx also hunt foxes, hares, marmots, wild pigs, beavers, birds or domestic animals such as sheep and goats, or, in Scandinavia, semi-domestic reindeer (Odden&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Mattisson <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the northern parts of European Russia and western Siberia, where roe deer are absent, mountain hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).</p>  <p>Home range size varies widely from 100 to over 1,000 km² (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008) depending on both prey density and social pressure (Herfindal <em>et al.</em> 2005, Aronsson <em>et al</em>. 2016). Home ranges averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland’s Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 1997). Average home range sizes in Switzerland were 90 km² for females and 150 km² for male lynx (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). In contrast, home range sizes are almost an order of magnitude larger in northern Scandinavia. Male home ranges generally enclose 1-2 female territories. Densities are typically 1-3 adults per 100 km², although higher densities of up to 5/100 km² have been reported from Eastern Europe and parts of Russia and lower densities of 0.3/100 km² from Scandinavia (Jedrzejewski <em>et al.</em> 1996, Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sunde <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>","<p>The major threats to lynx in Europe are low acceptance due to conflict with hunters (and in northern Europe also with livestock farmers and semi-domestic reindeer herders), illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation mainly due to infrastructure development, poor wildlife management structures and poor law enforcement, and accidental mortality.</p>  <p>There are also concerns in regard to the low genetic diversity and small population sizes shown in some of the populations. Besides the authochthonous Balkan lynx population this particularly concerns all the reintroduced populations which have – compared to the Carpathian source population – a considerably reduced heterozygosity and the high number of lost alleles as a consequence of genetic drift (Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2011, Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff unpubl.). This phenomenon is more pronounced in the Alpine (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff unpubl., Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff 2003), Dinaric (Sindicic <em>et al</em>. 2013), Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian and Vosges-Palatinian populations (Bull <em>et a</em><em>l.</em> 2016) while the Jura subpopulation is doing better. Inbreeding and inbreeding depression is, therefore, a potential threat to all the reintroduced, small subpopulations.</p>  <p>Additional threats to the European populations are detailed below:<br/> <br/><strong>1. Jura</strong><br/>Traffic accidents, illegal killing, conflicts with hunters and lack of knowledge about conflict mitigation.</p>  <p><strong>2. Vosges-Palatinian</strong><br/>Illegal killing due to conflicts with hunters and fragmentation used to be the major threats. Currently, the small population size is of big concern.</p>  <p><strong>3. Alpine</strong><br/>Threats include illegal killing, infrastructure development (especially road constructions), vehicle and train collisions, and limited dispersal. An emerging threat for the Alpine population is the narrow genetic base: all of the relatively few founder animals came from the same region and some of them were probably closely related. Genetic analysis indicates that the Alpine population has today the smallest level of heterozygosity of all European lynx populations.</p>  <p><strong>4. Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian</strong><br/>Intentional illegal killing, conflicts with hunters, and poor enforcement of legislation are the most relevant threats. Illegal killing is considered the most likely cause for the limited distribution (Magg <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  <p><strong>5. Dinaric</strong><br/>Poor enforcement of legislation (illegal killing), traffic mortalities and prey/food base depletion are major threats to the Dinaric population. An emerging additional threat is inbreeding depression as the population displays a considerable level of inbreeding (Sindicic <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>  <p><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>Poor integration of science into decision-making, traffic mortalities, conflicts with hunters, and lack of knowledge about species numbers and trends (lack of robust monitoring systems) are considered the most prominent threats.</p>  <p><strong>7. Scandinavian</strong><br/>The main threats are legal hunting (i.e. quotas are set too high) and illegal killing, both due to conflicts with livestock (nomadic grazing of reindeer, free-ranging sheep, Mattisson <em>et al.</em> 2014) and conflicts with hunters. Data indicate that illegal killing is an important mortality cause in some areas (Andrén <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>8. Karelian</strong><br/>Potential threats are intentional legal hunting/calling, conflicts with hunters, and lack of capacity and funding in management authorities.</p>  <p><strong>9. Baltic</strong><br/>Roads and railroads, poor dialogue with stakeholders, prey/food base, lack of knowledge about species numbers and trends, and lack of capacity and funding in management structures were considered the most important threats.</p>  <p><strong>10. Balkan</strong><br/>Poor enforcement of legislation, lack of capacity and funding in management structures, poor integration of science into decision making, corruption, accidental illegal killing and poorly regulated large-scale forestry all pose a major threat to the Balkan lynx.</p>  <p><strong>11. Harz</strong><br/>Road fatalities and diseases are the most relevant mortality factors of the released lynx so far (Anders 2016).</p>","<p>The total number of lynx in Europe is estimated at 8,000-9,000 individuals (excluding Russia and Belarus) and 17,000-18,000 individuals including European Russia, respectively. The largest subpopulations are the autochthonous ones in the north and east which have around 1,500-2,500 individuals each: Scandinavian (~1,300‐1,800), Karelian (Finish part ~2,500), Baltic (~1,200-1,500), Carpathian (~2,100-2,400). All the re‐introduced populations are still of small size. The current subpopulation sizes are as follows: Alpine 140‐170, Bohemian‐Bavarian-Austrian 60-80, Dinaric ~140, Jura ~140, Vosges‐Palatinian a few individuals, Harz 46 individuals. The subpopulation of greatest conservation concern is the fifth autochthonous one, the Balkan lynx subpopulation, which numbers only 20-39 mature individuals.</p>  <p>Most subpopulations have generally been stable in the past few years. Exceptions are the Scandinavian and Baltic subpopulations which have decreased and the Vosges-Palatinian population which has almost vanished.</p>  <p>Information on the status, distribution and developments of the European subpopulations over time are compiled in Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten (1990), Breitenmoser <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2000), von Arx <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2004), Linnell <em>et al. </em>(2008), Kasczensky <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2013), Chapron <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) and LCIE (in prep.).</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Eurasian Lynx has a very broad distribution. It occurs along forested mountain ranges in southeastern and Central Europe and from northern and eastern Europe through the boreal forests of Russia, down into Central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Europe, it was probably absent from some of the larger islands such as Ireland and Sicily and from countries with few forests. It was also absent from the Iberian Peninsula, where the smaller Iberian Lynx (<em>Lynx pardinus</em>) occurs. From this extensive distribution, lynx were exterminated from most of western and Central Europe with the exception of the Carpathian Mountains. It also survived in a small area in the southeastern Balkan (FYR Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro). Larger populations persisted in Fennoscandia and the Baltic States (but populations were heavily reduced), and in European Russia. Human activities reduced the lynx to its minimum numbers in the 1950s. In recent decades, many populations have recovered (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014). Lynx have been released in several areas of Europe in an effort to reintroduce this elusive predator, including in Switzerland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and France. There are some local but insufficiently documented releases known to support lynx populations in Poland and Lithuania.</p>  <p>Lynx occurring in Europe are viewed as belonging to eleven distinct populations (von Arx <em>et al.</em> 2004, Linnell <em>et al.</em> 2008, LCIE in prep.):<br/> <br/><strong>1. Jura</strong><br/>This population stretches across the Jura Mountains from central-eastern France north of the Rhone to western Switzerland between Geneva and Basel. Based on reintroduction in Switzerland in 1974/75, lynx have now colonised almost the entire mountain range. <br/> <br/><strong>2. Vosges-Palatinian</strong><br/>Founded through re-introductions in the French Vosges Mountains in the 1980s, the established population expanded to the German Palatinian Forest. The population started declining in the 1990s and is currently at the verge of extinction. A current <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&amp;n_proj_id=5104"">EU LIFE project</a> (Reintroduction of lynx in the biosphere reserve Palatinian Forest”) aims at releasing 20 lynx from the Carpathian and Jura populations into the Palatinian Forest in Germany (<a href=""https://snu.rlp.de/de/projekte/luchs/"">https://snu.rlp.de/de/projekte/luchs/</a>). <br/> <br/><strong>3. Alpine</strong><br/>Originates from re-introduction projects in the 1970s in Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. In the 1990s the population was fragmented into two sub-populations, nowadays, four subpopulations are identified (Molinari <em>et al.</em> 2018): (1) The area occupied by lynx in the north-western Alps (CH, FR) which has increased, (2) a new subpopulation founded in north-eastern Switzerland with the translocation of 12 lynx between 2001 and 2008, (3) a new occurrence established through the release of five lynx from 2011–2017 in the north-eastern Alps (Kalkalpen AT) and (4) the south-eastern Alpine subpopulation (IT, SI) which has however decreased continuously since 2000.<br/> <br/><strong>4. Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian</strong><br/>The population stretches in the triangle of the three range countries: in the south-western Czech Republic (Šumava Mts., SE-part of the Český les Mts. = Oberpfälzerwald, the Šumava foothills, Blanský les, Novohradské Mts.; Kutal <em>et al. </em>2017), eastern Germany (Bayerischer and Oberpfälzer Forest, Fichtelgebirge, Frankenwald), and northern Austria (Böhmerwald, Mühlviertel, Waldviertel).<br/> <br/><strong>5. Dinaric</strong><br/>The Dinaric population is distributed from central-southern Slovenia through central Croatia (Gorski Kotar and Lika) up to western Bosnia.<br/> <br/><strong>6. Carpathian</strong><br/>The distribution area covers at present almost the entire mountain chain of the Carpathians. The stronghold of the population is in Romania. Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine also hold relevant population segments. The distribution in Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria is scattered. Distribution and numbers may be overestimated as in many of the range countries no robust monitoring system exists. <br/> <br/><strong>7. Scandinavian</strong><br/>Lynx occur from southeastern to northern Norway and almost all over Sweden. <br/> <br/><strong>8. Karelian</strong><br/>The population stretches from the Republic of Karelia across to Finland where it is however only permanently present in the south to the centre of the country. The occasional presence in northern Finland is consistent with the situation in Murmanskaya Oblast, where indications are also much more scarcely compared to Karelia (Bragina <em>et al.</em> 2015) and with animals shared with the Scandinavian population.<br/> <br/><strong>9. Baltic</strong><br/>In the north (Estonia, eastern Latvia and northern Belarus) the distribution is continuous with Russia. In the rest of the range (Lithuania, main parts of Belarus, Poland, the Ukraine, and Kaliningrad) the distribution is highly fragmented.<br/> <br/><strong>10. Balkan</strong><br/>The Balkan Lynx is distributed in the south-west Balkans, mainly in the border area between Albania and Macedonia. Mavrovo National Park in Macedonia is the stronghold of the population. The Munella Mts. in Albania host the second but smaller subpopulation. Two different individuals were pictured in Bjeshkët e Nemuna, western Kosovo, not far from the border with Montenegro. From time to time there are single, unconfirmed observations in northern Greece.</p>  <p><strong>11. Harz</strong><br/>Lynx were reintroduced into the Harz National Park in Lower Saxony from 2000–2006. They have settled the entire Harz Mountains and surrounding areas.</p>",The species is sometimes hunted for sport. In some&#160;countries the species is also important for the skin market and the pelt&#160;industry.,Terrestrial,"<p>Included on CITES Appendix II and protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix III with the exception of the Balkan lynx <em>Lynx lynx balcanicus </em>which is listed in Appendix II) and the EU Habitats Directive (Annexes II and IV, except for Estonia where it is Annex V and with an exception from Annex II, and Finland and Latvia where it also has an exception from Annex II). The Lynx is protected and hunting prohibited in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine. In Sweden, Finland and Romania the lynx is protected but a limited number of lynx can be killed under Derogation. In Estonia and Norway the lynx is listed as a game species with an open hunting season and in Latvia lynx are exploited to a limited extent under derogation (Kaczensky <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the European part of Russia, the lynx is hunted/trapped in places where it is abundant as in some areas of the Central region and the Volga region, and in most areas of the North-Western region. Hunting is not allowed in the Northern Caucasus and in the Southern region (Bersenev <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>Since 2006, a programme for the recovery of the Balkan Lynx is being implemented aiming to secure the survival and recovery of this Critically Endangered subspecies.</p>  <p>In several European range states, prevention measures to counteract livestock depredation are in place and awareness has increased but measures for managing conflicts with hunters are still missing (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>There is a need for improved monitoring activities in many parts of the Carpathian and Baltic populations. The small and isolated European lynx populations in western and central Europe need a genetic improvement through the translocation of individuals from the source population (Carpathian) and improved connectivity between the populations to allow gene flow and prevent inbreeding depression.</p>  <p>Further recommendations on general and population-specific measures for the European populations are compiled in Boitani <em>et al.</em> (2015).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

While Black Rhino numbers have more than doubled since bottoming out in the mid 1990s (due to increased protection and enhanced biological management to keep more subpopulations productive), the species qualifies as CR due to the scale of the decline in numbers over the past three generations as a result of very heavy poaching in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Three generations ago (i.e., 44 years back in 1973) the point estimate for Black Rhinos was 37,807 rhinos and despite numbers more than doubling from a low of 2,354 were only 5,495 as of end 2017. This represents a decline over three generations of 85% qualifying as CR under criterion A2. An 83% reduction was projected one year (based on data up to and including 2017) into the future (from 1974–2018). This reduction was the same as observed in point estimates for these dates. The next worse projected reduction in point estimates over three generations was when modelling two years ahead from 1975–2019 (an 81% reduction from an estimated 28,674 in 1975). Numbers continue to increase at a continental-level although at a reduced rate due to the escalation of poaching since 2007.</p>","Black Rhino occur in a wide variety of habitats from desert areas in Namibia to wetter wooded areas. The highest densities of rhinos are found in savannas on nutrient-rich soils and in succulent Valley Bushveld areas. Black Rhino are browsers and favour small acacia's and other palatable woody species (<em>Grewia</em>'s<span style=""font-style: italic;"">,</span> Euphorbiaceae species, etc.) as well as palatable herbs and succulents. However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities). Surplus rhino that are removed from such established populations are routinely being profitably invested in new areas with suitable habitat and protection where populations can grow rapidly.","<p>Black Rhino face a variety of threats. The main threat to the species is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary&#160;Information&#160;file.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also reduce conservation budgets and incentives to conserve Black Rhino privately (both those privately owned and those managed for the state on a custodianship basis (due to declining live sales and greatly increased protection costs ). For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019 <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout most of the 20th century, the Black Rhino was the most numerous of the world's rhino species. Relentless hunting of the species and clearances of land for settlement and agriculture reduced numbers and by 1960 only an estimated 100,000 remained. Between 1960 and 1995, large-scale poaching caused a dramatic 98% collapse in numbers with numbers bottoming out in the mid 1990s. Over this period numbers only increased in South Africa and Namibia (Emslie and Brooks 1999). From 1992–1997 total numbers remained relatively stable with increases in some countries (those with the best-protected and managed populations) being cancelled out by declines in others. However, since the lows of the mid-1990s, Black Rhino numbers at a continental level have more than doubled reaching and estimated 5,495 by end 2017 (Emslie&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2019) and 5,630 by end 2018 (Knight 2019). Figure 1 in the attached Supplementary Information documentation shows how estimated total numbers of Black Rhino have changed over the last three-generations based on best estimates of rhino numbers per subspecies per country per year going back three-generations to 1973.<br/><br/>See Supplementary&#160;Information documentation for more information on sources of data.<br/><br/>Point estimates of subspecies/genetic management cluster totals as of 31 December 2017 were (see also Table 1 in the Supplementary&#160;Information): Southern-central Black Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. minor</span>) 2,305, South-western Black Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. bicornis</span>) 2,188 and Eastern Black Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. michaeli</span>) 1,002 based on AfRSG data with assistance of Range States.

Today putative <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. bicornis</span> range includes Namibia, southern Angola, western Botswana, and southwestern and southeastern South Africa (up to the Kei River), although today they occur only in Namibia (the stronghold) and South Africa with a sighting of one animal in Angola and unconfirmed reports of possibly another three animals.<br/><br/><em>Diceros b. michaeli</em> was distributed from South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia, through Kenya into northern-central Tanzania and Rwanda. Its current stronghold is Kenya. Smaller but growing numbers occur in northern Tanzania. The single animal that survived in Rwanda has died. One important free-ranging subpopulation occurs outside its range in a private game reserve in South Africa. Contractually, these <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. michaeli</span> animals may only be translocated back to historical range and not elsewhere in South Africa. The repatriation of some of these animals back to four areas of former subspecies range in Tanzania commenced in 1997, with animals also subsequently going to found a subpopulation in Rwanda.<br/><br/><em>Diceros b. minor</em> is believed to have occurred from southern Tanzania through Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to the northern, northwestern and northeastern parts of South Africa (north of the Mtamvuna River). It also probably occurred in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Angola, eastern Botswana, Malawi, and Eswatini. Today, its stronghold is South Africa and to a lesser extent Zimbabwe, with smaller numbers remaining in southern Tanzania. The South-central Black Rhino is now thought to be extinct in Angola and only one individual has been sighted in Mozambique since the 2008 IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) meeting. The subspecies has also been reintroduced to Botswana, Malawi, Eswatini and Zambia. Based on very small sample sizes, Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2017) results suggested that perhaps the original historical Black Rhino&#160;that used to occur in Zambia but which had been wiped out by poaching by 1995 might be better classified as&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli </em>rather than&#160;<em>D.b.mino</em>r. However, on account of the small sample sizes, and given that the species was reintroduced with&#160;<em>D. b. minor&#160;</em>founders, and that historically Zambia had been considered&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range, and climate and habitats are more similar to some&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range; reviewers recommended that historical pre-1995 Zambian animals should continue to be allocated to&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;for this Red List revision (as has historically been the case). With further data this may change in future. As there were still significant numbers of Black Rhinos in Zambia in the early 1970s, how these animals are allocated influences the&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;subspecies Red List assessment which would change to Endangered under criteria A2 and A4. The <em>D. b. michaeli</em> assessment remains the same whether or not the historical animals are classified as <em>D. b. minor</em> or&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli</em>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries,  the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not  releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts  and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons. For this  reason, only whole countries of occurrence are indicated on the range  maps produced by the AfRSG.</p>","Limited hunting of specific individual surplus Black Rhino males to further demographic and genetic metapopulation goals was only recently sanctioned by CITES.  Black Rhinos, however, are currently only openly sold in South Africa and in all other Range States Black Rhino on communal or private land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state.  Black Rhinos are primarily threatened by illegal killing for horn.<br/><br/>Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat with the occasional zoo animal being reintroduced.",Terrestrial,"Black Rhino have been listed on CITES Appendix I since 1977. All international commercial trade in Black Rhinos and their products have been prohibited. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of consumer states. Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new populations both within and outside the species' former range. Following a decline in breeding performance in some areas, increased effort has recently been given to improving biological management with a view to increasing metapopulation growth rates. Increasing efforts are also being made to integrate local communities into conservation efforts (most notably in the Kunene region of Namibia). Strategically, Black Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long term security. In contrast to Southern White Rhino, most Black Rhino on privately owned land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state. Since CITES CoP13 limited sport hunting quotas have been approved for the two Range States with biggest populations (South Africa and Namibia). Removal of specific individuals can enhance demographic and/or genetic conservation. In addition to local and, national initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the SADC Rhino Management Group, the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group and the East African Community Rhino Management Group. In addition to National Rhino Plans there is a Continental African Rhino Range States Conservation Plan.

However, the species needs conservation action to prevent future decline.","<p>  </p><p>Alpine Ibex typically inhabit open, rocky habitats above the upper tree-line ecotone in Alpine massifs. Steep slopes with rugged topography and meadows and pastures are preferred. Below the tree line, at subalpine levels, ibex are only found in open, sunny woodland interspersed with rocky outcrop. Ibex mainly feed on alpine grasses and herbs, but woody plants and cryptogams in low quantities have been also reported &#160;(Couturier 1962, Grignolio <em>et al. </em>2003, Hofmann and Nievergelt 1972, Nievergelt and Zingg 1986, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999, Villaret <em>et al. </em>1997).</p><p>  </p><p>Ibex activity peaks during daylight hours and is reduced during the night (Signer <em>et al. </em>2011). The Alpine Ibex shows seasonal migration between summer and winter home ranges. They spend the harsh winter months at lower elevations on south-exposed steep slopes, while they select higher altitudes in summer, following the green-up wave and seeking for lower temperatures (Aublet <em>et al.</em> 2009, Brivio <em>et al.</em> 2019). Winter and summer home ranges may be several kilometres distant, but individuals show a high fidelity to seasonal home ranges (Parrini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). </p><p>  </p><p>Males and females live in separate groups outside the rutting season (Villaret et al. 1997, Bon et al. 2001, Grignolio et al. 2003). Group size largely depends on the season, on the habitat and on the population density (Toïgo <em>et al. </em>1996), even if it can be affected by other environmental drivers (Grignolio <em>et al. </em>2019). &#160;Gestation lasts about 167 days (Stüwe and Grodinsky 1987). Females give birth from early June to mid-July, usually to one kid even if some cases of twinship have been reported (Couturier 1962, Apollonio <em>et al.</em> 2013). Males and females are sexually mature when 18 months old. However, males can access reproduction only at older ages because of social constraints, and the age of females at primiparity may be delayed in high density populations (Toïgo <em>et al. </em>2002). The rut takes place from early December to mid-January, with a peak between 15<sup>th</sup> of December and 10<sup>th</sup> of January (Couturier 1962; Willisch and Neuhaus 2009, 2010; Apollonio <em>et al. </em>2013). Dominant (i.e. older) males adopt the ‘tending’ tactic, courting oestrus females to gain exclusive access to mating, while younger, subordinate, males adopt &#160;the alternative ‘coursing’ tactic, trying to achieve temporary access to females who eventually are separated from the tending, dominant male (Willisch and Neuhaus 2009, Apollonio <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>  </p><p>Maximum longevity is up to 15-17 years for males and 20-22 years for females, even if rare exceptions have been reported for older individuals.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>              <a name=""_msocom_1""></a>","<p>  </p><p>Although at present the species is not considered threatened because of its increasing numbers during the last decades, there is concern regarding its genetic diversity and ability to cope with the rapid global changes that are currently occurring. </p><p>  </p><p>A major threat for Alpine Ibex comes from its extremely low genetic diversity and high inbreeding levels, which are consequences of the severe repeated bottlenecks experienced by all extant populations combined with the small size and isolation of these populations linked to low recolonization rates (no genetic exchange between populations) (Biebach &amp; Keller 2009, 2010, 2012). This may lead to inbreeding depression (Brambilla <em>et al. </em>2015), increased disease susceptibility (Brambilla <em>et al.</em> 2018) and reduced population growth rates (Bozzuto <em>et al. </em>2019). At a time when the environment changes rapidly because of global changes and when new diseases emerge, this low genetic diversity may be a serious threat for Alpine Ibex.</p><p>  </p><p>Modification in human activities may also represent a potential threat. The increase of recreational activities, i.e. hiking, climbing, paragliding, the use of drones or helicopters, represent a disturbance that can affect Alpine Ibex home range selection and activity budget (Brambilla and Brivio 2018). The intensive use of pastures by domestic herds (cattle, sheep and goats) may promote competition for food resources and transmission of diseases. Hybridization with domestic goats is also a threat for the conservation of the species. </p><p>  </p><p>The Alps are severely exposed to climate warming with many negative consequences on Alpine Ibex through direct effects (adaptive behaviour to avoid heat to the detriment of feeding) or indirect effects (mismatch between vegetation peak and birth dates, decreasing food quantity and quality in summer) (Aublet <em>et al.</em> 2009, Brivio <em>et al. </em>2019, Mason <em>et al. </em>2017, Pettorelli <em>et al. </em>2007, Toïgo <em>et al.</em> 2017). In consequence of the ongoing climate change, ibex is predicted to forage in limited areas closer and closer to mountaintops (Brivio <em>et al. </em>2019) and thus to find more and more restricted suitable habitat.&#160; The ongoing natural expansion of a predator (i.e. the wolf) in the Alps does not seem to give rise to concern (Grignolio <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019, Palmegiani <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).</p><p>  </p><p>Some diseases may endanger populations, e.g. sarcoptic mange, infectious respiratory syndromes (caused by viruses and bacteria), arthritis-encephalitis virus infections (CAEV).</p><p>  </p><p>The Alpine Ibex is legally hunted in some countries (e.g. Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Argentina), while hunting is prohibited in other countries such as France and Italy (Shackleton 1997). Legal hunting is not considered a threat if it is properly planned and regulated, but poaching is a potential threat (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p><p>  </p><p>Because of all the reasons mentioned above, the species may be at risk in a not too far future. Conservation measures have to be undertaken such as the reinforcement of genetic diversity and connectivity between populations.&#160;<br/></p>","After centuries of decline caused primarily by intensive hunting, Alpine Ibex was close to extinction at the beginning of the 19th century, with only one hundred individuals surviving in the region around the Gran Paradiso massif along the Italian-French border (Grodinsky and Stüwe 1987). Thanks to active protection and to intensive reintroduction programs conducted in the 20th century, the species recovered and is now present again along the entire Alpine arc (AIESG Alpine Ibex European Specialist Group)<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><a name=""_msoanchor_1"" class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1""></a>. <br/>An overall estimate of about 53,000 individuals from 180 colonies was assessed in the years 2008-2017 (AIESG Alpine Ibex European Specialist Group). The numbers of Alpine Ibex in the different countries of the native range are around: 9,450 in France, 16,400 in Italy, 18,000 in Switzerland, 7,400 in Austria, 500 in Germany, and 300 in Slovenia. The overall number of individuals appears to have very slightly increased over the last 10 years compared to the estimates of previous reports.&#160;<br/>However, the distribution is quite fragmented and not all the suitable habitat is occupied, mainly because the species has a very low colonizing potential. Recently, some restocking and translocations were conducted to increase genetic variation of the reintroduced populations and to favour gene flow among them. Indeed, because of its particular history, the species experienced several severe genetic bottlenecks, and all the extant populations have a low genetic diversity and high inbreeding levels (Biebach and Keller 2009, 2012; Grossen<em> et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Stable,"<p>The Alpine Ibex is endemic to Europe, where its native range is the Alps (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005). The species was driven very close to extinction in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century due to overhunting and poaching. Thanks to active protection and reintroduction programs, nowadays the species is present again across the entire Alpine arc. All current populations originate from re-introductions or introductions, except for the population in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). Alpine Ibex populations are present in: France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria and Slovenia. Additional ibex populations can be found in Bulgaria and Argentina, regions where it was introduced around 1980s, far away from the species’ native range. Although the range of Alpine ibex has increased over the last century, as a result of translocations and few natural recolonizations, its distribution is still fragmented because of the very long recolonization time of the species. <br/><br/>Alpine ibex mainly occurs between 1,600 and 3,200 m asl although several populations may be found as low as 700-800 m asl (Nievergelt and Zingg 1986).</p>","Management regulations are different between countries. Alpine Ibex is completely protected in some countries (France, Italy), while hunted for sport and food in others (Austria, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Switzerland). Legal hunting is well-managed and is not considered to be a threat to the species. No data are available to estimate poaching pressure.",Terrestrial,"<p>  </p><p>The Alpine Ibex is included in the Bern Convention (Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, Appendix III – Protected Fauna Species, 1979) and in the European Directive 43/92/CEE “Habitat”, Annex V (Updated with Directive 97/62/CE, 27 Oct 1997). The species is protected under national legislation in France and Italy and occurs in several protected areas in most countries. It has been the subject of intensive conservation management in the form of reintroductions and introductions ( Stüwe and Nievergelt 1991, Shackleton 1997). Reintroductions began at the beginning of 20<sup>th</sup> century in the Swiss Alps and in the Alpi Marittime region (Italy) but most reintroductions have been conducted from the 1970s (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p><p>  </p><p>Most recent recommendations for the conservation of the Alpine Ibex strongly emphasize the need (1) to reinforce the genetic diversity of existing populations by translocating individuals from other populations, and (2) to enhance the connectivity between populations by reintroducing individuals in areas potentially connecting two populations. A particular focus has to be exerted on the genetic characteristics of translocated individuals to maximize genetic diversity in the reinforced population. A good knowledge of the space use patterns within and between subpopulations is a prerequisite for translocations aimed at increasing the connectivity between them.<br/> <br/> Reintroductions to suitable areas where the Alpine Ibex is still absent should also be planned to ensure a safe future to this species. For such reintroductions, as recommended earlier by <br/> Shackleton (1997) and Dupré <em>et al.</em> (2001), it would be appropriate (1) using reliable environmental suitability models for the selection of areas where Alpine Ibex colonies could be reintroduced. These models should particularly take into account the availability of areas where overheating during summer may be avoided; (2) conducting a translocation strategy that aims to make the separate colonies part of a metapopulation; (3) giving priority to protected areas, or at least to &#160;areas capable of guaranteeing an efficient surveillance against poaching and disturbance (this does not mean that controlled hunting areas should be excluded<em> a priori</em>); (4) selecting founder individuals for new colonies according to specific criteria (sex, age, genetic diversity); (5) limiting or even possibly eliminating domestic sheep and goat grazing in reintroduction areas to decrease the risk of disease transmission, resource competition, and hybridization; and (6) screening the suitability of reintroduction sites in relation to the absence of endemic diseases. <br/> <br/> Other conservation recommendations include ensuring that any harvest should be sustainable (through monitoring, legislation, and international cooperation), eliminating poaching (through legislation, law enforcement, education and communication), reducing the impacts of human disturbance (e.g. by providing refugees in areas with intense tourism pressure), monitoring all populations and investigating the effects of global changes.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Europe

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

However, recent population estimates suggest that the future prospect of some subpopulations or subspecies is of some concern, particularly that of the Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest (which, it seems, may have undergone a precipitous decline in numbers). Furthermore, several subpopulations remain entirely dependent on management regimes, particularly the migratory wildebeest population of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, which accounts for some 70% of total population numbers.","This species occurs in short-grass plains, and bordering Acacia savanna open bushland and woodland in drier areas. Serengeti wildebeests thrive on short grasslands on alkaline and volcanic soils during the rainy season, and withdraw to longer grasslands in areas of higher rainfall and permanent water during the dry season. They are rarely found above 1,800-2,100 m (e.g. the Ngorongoro Crater). Common Wildebeest are pure grazers, requiring water at least every day or two in the dry season (Estes 2013).","Once often found in large concentrations, the numbers and distribution of Common Wildebeest have been reduced by the spread of settlement and livestock, elimination of water sources through watershed deforestation and expropriation for irrigation, poaching for meat, the loss of the seasonal ranges of some migratory populations, and  game eradication programs in failed efforts to eliminate the wild hosts of sleeping sickness (nagana) and other diseases of domestic livestock (East 1999, Estes 2013). Fences that blocked migration between wet and dry-season ranges have caused mass die-off events, by denying access to water and to higher-rainfall refuges during severe droughts. A notorious example is the decline in numbers and episodes of mass mortality of Botswana wildebeest caused by veterinary cordon fences that blocked drought-induced migrations, particularly after thousands died at Lake Xau in the north-east of the Kalahari Desert in 1980 (Owens and Owens 1980).","During the late 1990s, estimates were available for all of the major surviving populations of this species, mainly from aerial surveys, producing a total population in excess of 1,200,000 (correcting for undercounting bias in aerial surveys). The migratory Serengeti-Mara population represented about 70% of global species numbers (942,000, having dropped below one million following the severe 1993 drought). Other population estimates were: Blue Wildebeest, 150,000 (with about half in protected areas, and one-quarter on private land and conservancies); Cookson’s Wildebeest, 16,000 (about 60% in protected areas); Nyassa Wildebeest, 96,000 (about two-thirds in protected areas, particularly Selous); and Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest, 94,000 (with about two-thirds in and around protected areas) (East 1999). <br/><br/>The most recent estimate of the total population size of Common Wildebeest is around 1,550,000 (Estes and East 2009), largely due to the rebounding of the Serengeti population to about 1,300,000 (Thirgood <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004); other subspecies populations are estimated at 130,000 Blue Wildebeest, 5,000-10,000 Cookson’s, and 50,000-75,000 Nyassa. However, estimates of Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest indicate a steep decline in the subspecies’ populations to a current level of perhaps 6,000-8,000 animals.<br/><br/>Citing various authors, East (1999) indicates that population densities estimated by aerial surveys range from less than 0.15/km² in areas such as Kafue, Etosha, Hwange and the central and southern Kalahari, to 0.6-1.3/km² in areas such as Kruger, North Luangwa, Selous and Kajiado, and 3.6/km² in Tarangire. Recent total counts in areas where the species is abundant have produced population density estimates as high as 34.0-35.0/km², e.g., Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater.",Stable,"The Common Wildebeest (<em>Connochaetes taurinus</em>) is formerly distributed from southern Kenya southwards to northern and eastern Namibia, Botswana, the Orange River in South Africa, and Mozambique (East 1999, 2013). This species have also been introduced to regions outside their former distribution range, such as the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe and private farmland in Namibia (East 1999).<br/><br/>The ranges of the five subspecies are as follows (following East 1999, 2013):<br/><br/><em>C. t. taurinus</em> (Blue Wildebeest). Namibia and South Africa to Mozambique north of the Orange River, and from Mozambique to Zambia south of the Zambezi River, and from south-west Zambia to south-east and southern Angola.<br/> <em>C. t. cooksoni</em> (Cookson’s Wildebeest).

Northern Tanzania and southern Kenya west of the Gregory Rift Valley, reaching Lake Victoria at Speke Bay.",The Common Wildebeest is hunted for food and sport.,Terrestrial,"The vulnerability of this species to illegal hunting and loss of habitat caused by the encroachment of settlement is increased by the dependence of some migratory populations on seasonal access to unprotected rangelands. In these cases (e.g., Liuwa Plain, Tarangire and Kajiado) effective protection and management of national parks which contain only part of the population’s annual range may be insufficient to prevent major population declines. Loss of range outside protected areas may result in the replacement of migratory populations with much smaller (but nevertheless substantial) resident populations within protected areas, as has occurred in areas such as Etosha National Park and Central Kgalagadi Game Reserve. Some wildebeest populations are naturally relatively sedentary and/or their seasonal movements are generally accommodated within protected areas (e.g., Kafue, Luangwa, Hwange and Selous). The overall status of the species may not change in the long term if it continues to be well represented in protected areas and on private land, but if current trends continue its populations will become increasingly sedentary within fenced parks, reserves and farms (East 1999).<br/><br/>The future of the enormous migratory wildebeest population of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem will have a major impact on the species’ overall conservation status. This population has shown signs of recovery from its decline in the early 1990s (Thirgood <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), but two sections of the migration route – the Ikoma Open Area and the Mara Group Ranches – currently receive limited protection and are threatened by poaching or agriculture. Other smaller, but substantial populations, of Common Wildebeest occur in areas such as: Kafue and Liuwa Plain (Zambia), Etosha (Namibia), Okavango, Makgadikgadi-Nxai Pan, Ngamiland and the central and southern Kalahari (Botswana), Hwange (Zimbabwe), Kruger, Hluhluwe-Umfolozi and Mkuzi (South Africa), Hlane (Swaziland) and private farmland (Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa) (Blue Wildebeest); the Luangwa Valley (Zambia) (Cookson’s Wildebeest); the Selous ecosystem (Tanzania) (Nyassa Wildebeest); Ngorongoro Crater (Tanzania) (Western White-bearded Wildebeest); and Tarangire (Tanzania) and Kajiado (Kenya) (Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest).

Although likely to be slowly declining in some parts of its range, it is also undergoing range expansions in other areas. There are no threats known to be causing major range-wide declines that would warrant listing in a threatened category or even as Near Threatened and the species is therefore listed as Least Concern.","Due to its tolerance of dry conditions and its omnivorous diet, the Golden Jackal can live in a wide variety of habitats, exceeding 2,000 m in elevation, ranging from semi-arid environments to forested, mangrove, agricultural, rural and semi-urban habitats in India and Bangladesh (Clutton-Brock <em>et al.</em> 1976; Prater 1980; Poche <em>et al</em>. 1987; Y. Jhala, pers. obs.). In Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia the species is strongly associated with lowland deciduous dipterocarp forests, but is also found sometimes in highly degraded and opened-up areas of other forest-types. These typically support many people and it is possible that they would be used more extensively if persecution of carnivores within them were not so heavy (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998). In Europe, the species prefers cultivated areas and wetlands in lower elevations and heterogenous habitats with adequate cover for hiding and breeding (Šálek <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Jackals are opportunistic and will venture into human habitation at night to feed on garbage; garbage dumps also regularly attract and support high jackal densities (Ćirović <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moderate human activity may benefit the species in areas where persecution of carnivores is at most only relatively light, as it tends to increase availability of food (carrion, refuse, and animal dung) (Giannatos 2004). An especially important source of food in Europe are slaughter remains and other animal waste from livestock, which represents approximately 40% of jackal diet across the continent (Ćirović <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The absence of larger predators like the Grey Wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>) seems to favour the recovery of the species in many areas (Kryštufek and Tvrtkovič 1990; Giannatos 2004) and indeed extermination of wolves has been implicated as a major reason for the expansion of jackals throughout Europe (Krofel <em>et al</em>. 2017; Newsome <em>et al</em>. 2017). Similarly, in Southeast Asia the Dhole (<em>Cuon alpinus</em>) may suppress jackal numbers, so that jackal numbers increase locally when dhole numbers decline (J. F. Kamler, unpubl. data). It has also been hypothesized that climatic changes due to global warming will reduce barriers to the dispersal of jackals, such as long winters with severe snow cover (Arnold&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).","At least in the European part of their range, Golden Jackals appear to be staging a come-back, with marked expansion into areas where they were previously present but disappeared, as well as into countries where they have not previously been recorded (Arnold <em>et al</em>. 2012; Trouwborst <em>et al</em>. 2015; Krofel <em>et al</em>. 2017). There is a paucity of information from the more easterly parts of the species' distribution range, but there is some evidence of localised declines (e.g. in the southern Western Ghats due to agriculture, logging and human settlements; Pillay <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;In Lao PDR and Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Thailand and Cambodia, it is likely that heavy persecution, especially widespread indiscriminate snaring, keeps jackal populations much lower than they would otherwise be (W. Duckworth and J.F. Kamler pers. comm.); on the other hand, in Israel and in some parts of Europe it appears that hunting does not affect jackal populations (Kapota 2014). In Europe, Israel (e.g., the Golan Heights; Yom-Tov <em>et al</em>. 1995) and elsewhere (e.g. parts of Bangladesh; Poche <em>et al</em>. 1987), Golden Jackals are sometimes perceived as a pest species (e.g. where there are garbage dumps or abattoir dumps, jackal numbers are increasing). Equally, the species has an acknowledged role in removing high quantities of animal waste and crop pest rodents in European human-dominated landscapes (Ćirović <em>et al</em>. 2016).","The Golden Jackal is fairly common throughout most of its range. High densities are observed in areas with abundant food and cover.&#160;In Europe Golden Jackal typically occurs in densities around 1 family group per km² with recorded range of 0.1-5 family groups per km² (Banea <em>et al</em>. 2012; Šálek <em>et al</em>. 2014; M. Krofel, unpubl.). Population size for Europe was roughly estimated at 70,000 Golden Jackals (Ćirović <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;There is a lack of knowledge on population densities for most areas in the eastern extent (particularly Vietnam and Lao PDR) where the species appears to be scarce and localized. In India, jackal populations achieve high densities in pastoral areas such as Kutch, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Haryana. Based on intensive observations on breeding pack units and radio-collared individuals, jackal densities in the semi-arid Velavadar National Park were estimated between one and two jackals per km² (Moehlman and Jhala 2004); see Sharma (1998) for densities quoted for the Thar Desert in India.&#160;Based on known density estimates for parts of India and considering that about 19% (i.e., about 637,000 km²) of the geographical area of India has forest cover with jackal populations (and that jackals are also found outside forested habitats), a minimum population estimate of over 80,000 Golden Jackals would not be unreasonable for the Indian sub-continent. However, there is also evidence for recent declines in some parts; for example, they have shown a 50% reduction in detectability in the southern parts of the Western Ghats (Pillay <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Increasing,"In Europe, the Golden Jackal was historically limited to coastal regions along the Mediterranean and Black Sea (Krofel <em>et al</em>. 2017). During the 19th century, expansion started in south-eastern Europe. Following a period of decline and subsequent recovery, they have been expanding their range northwards and westwards in many parts of Europe during the 20th century (Kryštufek and Tvrtkovič 1990, Kryštufek&#160;1999, Arnold&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Trouwborst&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Krofel <em>et al</em>. 2017). In recent years, they have both recolonized parts of their range where they were previously present, such as the former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia (Ivanov <em>et al</em>. 2016), as well as expanded their range into new countries where they probably mostly occur as vagrants for now, such as Switzerland, Poland and Germany. Presence in Europe, either as native or vagrant, follows Trouwborst&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015) and Krofel <em>et al</em>. (2017), with the exception of Slovakia where they are now considered native (after Slamka <em>et al</em>. 2017), and mapped range follows Trouwborst <em>et al</em>. (2015) in mapping only areas of (current) permanent presence. In early 2016, a Golden Jackal was camera-trapped in the Veluwe Nature Reserve in the Netherlands, the first record for this country; there have also been several recent (since 2015) records from Denmark and at least one record from Haute-Savoie in France in 2017. The expansion thus appears far from being complete and the distribution range of the species is predicted to continue to increase towards the west and north of the continent.<br/><br/>Southwards, Golden Jackals range into Turkey, Syria and Iraq into the Arabian Peninsula, where the species is today restricted to a small part of eastern Saudi Arabia in the Hofuf area and around Al Asfah; however, there are also records from the last few decades from Qatar (Hellyer 2009) and Jordan (Amr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004) and it is possible that it may occur in Kuwait (Mallon and Budd 2011). Gasperetti&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1985) listed it for Yemen, based on records from the end of the 19th century (see also Al-Safadi 1990 and Al-Jumaily 1998), but Mallon and Budd (2011) remarked that these reports are unconfirmed and likely to be erroneous or refer to released or imported animals. There are no confirmed records for UAE. The species does occur in Israel, and Viranta&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2017) remark on a single&#160;<em>Canis aureus</em>&#160;haplotype in their study from the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, noting this could denote the presence of hybrids with&#160;<em>Canis lupaster</em>.<br/><br/>The Golden Jackal then ranges eastwards through Iran, Central Asia and the entire Indian subcontinent east and south to Sri Lanka, Myanmar and parts of Indochina (Jhala and Moehlman 2004). Duckworth <em>et al</em>. (1998) reviewed what was known of the range of the species at the time in Indochina, noting its presence in low-lying regions of eastern Cambodia, southern Vietnam and southern Lao PDR. It has subsequently been recorded in central Lao PDR (Nakai plateau, pre-inundation; Dersu&#160;2008).","There is no significant trade in Golden Jackal products, although skins and tails are very occasionally sold. In some regions (e.g. Croatia), there is also commercial some limited trophy hunting for foreign hunters.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legal protection</strong><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix III (in India). Jackals feature on Schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) of India and are afforded the lowest level of legal protection (mainly to control trade of pelts and tails). However, no hunting of any wildlife is permitted under the current legal system in India. In Europe, the Golden Jackal is included in the Annex V of the Habitats Directive, 92/43 EC as a species of Community interest. At the national level in Europe, their status under domestic law varies amongst the 26 countries west of the Black Sea where the species’ presence has been confirmed; for example, in 14 countries, Golden Jackals may be hunted in accordance with national hunting legislation, which in many cases includes&#160;a defined hunting season (e.g. Montenegro, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)&#160;(see Trouwborst <em>et al</em>. 2015 for a full review, including a discussion of some of the management confusion&#160;due to recent range expansion and inadequate legal interpretation).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Golden Jackals are present in a great number of protected areas across their range.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Captivity</strong><br/>Golden Jackals are common in many zoos in India and a few in Europe, but otherwise are not commonly held in conservation breeding programmes.<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge</strong><br/>The status of the species in the Middle East requires clarification. Little quantitative information is available on jackal densities in most parts of Asia, habitat use, and ranging patterns in relation to food availability. Information on ecology, dispersal, survival and mortality factors of adults, pups and dispersing individuals is needed, since most of the previous studies have been done in Africa, where studied animals are now recognized as a separate species.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
163991139,15954,Panthera pardus,Vulnerable,A2cd,2020,2015-07-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Leopards are widely distributed across Africa and Asia, but populations have become reduced and isolated, and they are now extirpated from large portions of their historic range. Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution with increased human populations (Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014), habitat fragmentation (UN 2014), increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008), excessive harvesting for ceremonial use of skins (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015), prey base declines (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East and West Africa, Middle East, East and South-east Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations have increased by 2.57 percent annually from 1994 to 2014 (UN 2014) driving a 57% increase in the conversion of potential Leopard habitat to agricultural areas from 1975 to 2000 (Brink and Eva 2009). Deforestation in South-east Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). These factors were not incorporated in the previous assessment and likely have a substantial impact on suitable Leopard range.<br/><br/>Comparison of the extent of extant range presented in this assessment (8,515,935 km², see map) with that produced by Red List Assessors in 2007 (21,953,435 km²: Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2008) yields a range reduction of 61%. However the severity of this reduction is inaccurate due to previous insufficient sampling (the 2016 map is much more detailed in resolution, see Methodology in the Supplementary Material), and the reduction has likely occurred over a longer time scale. Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2008, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect, however, that at least half of the reduction translates to real and relatively recent range loss. Also in southern Africa, the so called stronghold of the Leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that Leopard populations have remained stable (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015). In Zimbabwe, much Leopard range has disappeared due to the resettlement of private farmland and subsequent loss of prey populations (du Toit 2004). We estimate regional range loss of approximately 21% in southern Africa. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fusari <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2012) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Preliminary data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa. It is suggested that 4,500-7,000 Leopards area harvested annually to fuel the demand for Leopards skins by followers of the Nazareth Babtist (Shembe) Church only (Balme unpub. data).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme <em>et al.</em> (2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman <em>et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The concern about unsustainable trophy hunting has lately increased, e.g. South Africa has banned trophy hunting for 2016. This followed an alert by its CITES Scientific Authority that the number of Leopards in the country was unknown, and that trophy hunting posed a high risk to the survival of the species.<br/><br/>Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat and prey, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are not well understood, have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","<strong><em>Habitat Types and Range</em></strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the snowy regions of the Russian Far-East. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards do occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Occupancy survey found that Leopards occupied 174,066 km² of forest habitat in India (Jhalla <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Despite widespread occurrence they are killed in very large numbers in India (Raza <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong><em>Diet</em></strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10- 40 kgs) where available (Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitors density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the prey items in the diet (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Shehzad <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range.<br/><br/><strong><em>Home Range Size</em></strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 to 15 km² (Odden <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Hunter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Recent reports from northern Iraq suggest unsustainable levels of Leopard removal (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/>In the face of changing land-use, prey availability and direct mortality from humans, Leopards have persisted where other large predators have not. Their ability to live within human-dominated landscapes and feed on a variety of prey have given many people the impression that Leopards require little concern, however, recent trends have shown that current threats have substantially reduced Leopard populations throughout West and Central Africa, South-west and South-east Asia and China.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in review). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered and Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2008 and should retain these listings in 2016 based on the following population estimates and a declining trend:<br/><ul><li>Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(ii), D):&#160;&lt;60 (Jackson and Nowell 2008, Sugimoto <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Xiao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).</li><li>Arabian Leopard (<em>P. p. nimr</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 45-200 (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 350-525, with &lt;250 mature breeding adults (Ario <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 700-950 (Kittle and Watson 2015).</li><li>Persian Leopard (<em>P. p. saxicolor</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 800-1,000 (Khorozyan 2008).<br/></li></ul>[<strong>Note</strong> that although the Red List Categories and Criteria for the subspecies assessments published in 2008 have not changed, the assessments no longer appear on The IUCN Red List as the information they contain may be out-of-date or may contradictory to the information presented here.]<br/><br/>This current (2015) assessment looked at available information on Leopard status on a regional basis (as discussed below). Across the majority of range, leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) since the previous assessment as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards be listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. In India, the Caucasus and the Russian Far-East, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts.<br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> review). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were not undertaken for Leopards. Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and again, a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, from 1994 to 2014, the human population in Africa increased by 2.57 percent annually (from 0.699 billion to 1.139 billion) (UN 2014), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies <em>P. p. pardus</em> potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping, geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Since the previous assessment, remnant populations in Morocco and Algeria are likely extirpated as recent surveys have failed to confirm their presence (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). The Egyptian population is considered very small with only a few observed signs in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, whereas there has been no recorded sign in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, the North African subpopulation potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><u>Sub-Saharan Africa</u>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (Hatton <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UN 2013), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2013), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21 %, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa potentially qualifies as VU (criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for other areas of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g., Henschel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><u>Indian Leopard (<em>P. p. fusca</em>)</u>: The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Poaching for wildlife trade is an increasing threat to Indian Leopards (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). For example, Raza <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2012b) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Selvan <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Mondal <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000-14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). A full assessment is recommended for <em>P. p. fusca</em>, as it may potentially qualify as Vulnerable due to a suspected declining population containing fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/><u>North China Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. japonensis</em>)</u>: A recent review of Leopard distribution shows a &gt;80% reduction in range considered extant in 2008 (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). This subspecies, endemic to China, now occurs only in parts of seven provinces, and the total population is estimated at &lt;500 individuals (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), with the number of mature individuals likely less than that. Subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), and habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). These threats are expected to continue in the future, indicating that Leopard populations may continue to decline. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for <em>P. p. japonensis</em> or the subpopulation of North China, as it potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered or Endangered due to a small, steeply declining population.<br/><br/><u>Indochinese Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. delacouri</em>)</u>: A recent review showed a dramatic reduction of over 80% in range where Leopards are considered extant in South-east Asia compared to 2008 (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Singapore, and only small fragmented populations remain in Cambodia, southeastern China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a total estimated population of &lt;2,500 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade is probably the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (J. F. Kamler pers. obs.). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kawanishi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and thus likely to have negative impacts on the leopard populations. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for the Sout-heast Asian Leopard subpopulation (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>), as it potentially qualifies as Endangered due to a small declining population.<br/><br/><u>Other subspecies</u>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula (<em>P. p. nimr</em>), Java (<em>P. p. melas</em>), and Russian Far-East (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) continue to require listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. Although the population of <em>P. p. orientalis</em> may have increased recently, especially on the Chinese side of the border (Xiao <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the total population remains &lt;60 individuals. With no noted population or range increase, the Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) should retain its current status as Endangered. The Leopard of southwestern Asia (<em>P. p. saxicolor or ciscaucasica</em>) has been recorded in previously undocumented areas of the Caucasus, such as Georgia and Azerbajian (Sarukhanova 2014, Voskyanyan 2014), however, due to overall low numbers and restricted range, this subspecies should remain listed as Endangered (Khorozyan 2008). See the individual Red List accounts for more details regarding these subspecies.<br/><br/><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected.",Decreasing,"Our assessment of Leopard distribution has been divided into two geographic regions: Africa and Asia. In order to describe these regions, we have further divided Leopard distribution into sub-regions to address local population trends. A detailed discussion of the methodology used to produce the 2015 range map can be found in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Africa</em></strong><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in North Africa has been restricted by 97% of their former range with only remnant, isolated populations remaining (Durant <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). An adult male Leopard was killed in the Elba region of southeastern Egypt in retaliation for livestock depredation, though evidence of a breeding population is still uncertain (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2014). Continued camera-trapping efforts have failed to capture the presence of Leopard in the Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). The presence of Leopards was confirmed in the Ahaggar Mountains of Algeria from the genetic testing of one scat sample in 2005 but no presence has been confirmed since (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). Leopards are thought to be extirpated from Morocco (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u>West Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in West Africa has been dramatically reduced. This reduction is likely due to habitat fragmentation, but also more rigorous survey efforts that have confirmed presence and likely absence across the region (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014). Leopards have been confirmed in Niger along the southwestern border with Benin and Burkina Faso (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014) but previous reports in Air and Tenere National Reserves are unconfirmed. Leopards are generally restricted to a few protected areas from Senegal in the west to Nigeria in the east. Leopards have been reported in the south of Senegal including Parc National de Niokolo-Koba. In Sierra Leone, there are small remnant populations near Outamba Kilimi National Park and Gola National Forest as well as the eastern boundary with Guinea/ Liberia. Leopard populations in Liberia have been recorded in Lofa-Mano National Park in the west and Sapo National Park in the east. In Ghana, Leopards are found along the boundary with Côte d’Ivoire and Mole National Park in the north and west (<em>c.</em> Burton pers. comm. 2014). In Benin, Leopard are found along the northern boundary. Leopards are nearly absent from Nigeria.<br/><br/><u>Central Africa</u>: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Leopard range was largely reduced in areas of increased human influence and areas relatively easy to access and therefore open to illegal hunting and bushmeat trade. In Cameroon, Leopards are found in the northern and southern portions of the country. In Gabon, Leopards are found throughout the country with small absent pockets in the southeast and southwest. In the Central African Republic (CAR) Leopards are found in the southwest, central and eastern portions of the country. Leopards are found throughout South Sudan with the exception of the Sudd wetland.<br/><br/><u>East Africa</u>: The distribution of Leopards in East Africa has been reduced, in particular in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and central Tanzania. There are possible remnant populations in Djibouti, Eritrea, and North Sudan. They are nearly absent from Somalia. Leopards are found throughout southern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda and the west, central and southern portions of Kenya (Z. Davidson pers. comm. 2014, I. Seme pers. comm.2014, G. Yirga pers. comm. 2014). In Tanzania, Leopards are found throughout the Serengeti-Ngorogoro Crater system and to the south and west. It is thought that Leopards are absent from the southeastern boundary of Lake Victoria to Central Tanzania.<br/><br/><u>Southern Africa</u>: Southern Africa likely has the healthiest Leopard populations of their entire range. It is generally thought that Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have declining but healthy Leopard populations outside of human dominated areas (C.<em>&#160;</em>Begg pers. comm. 2014, A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2014, P. Schuette pers. comm. 2014). In Namibia, Leopards inhabit most of the country with the exception of the highly populated northern region, the arid southeast farmlands and the desert coast (Stein 2011). Botswana has a continuous Leopard population in the North and West. In South Africa, Leopards are found along the boundaries with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique with dense populations located in the Limpopo region. Leopards are also located in the Cape provinces of South Africa.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Asia</em></strong><br/><u>Middle East</u>: The main stronghold for the Arabian Leopard (<span><em>P. p. nimr</em>) is the continuous tract of the Dhofar area in southwestern Oman and the Hawf area in northeastern Yemen (Khorozyan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Spalton <em>et al </em>2014). There are also small, isolated populations in Saudi Arabia (Zaffar-ul-Islam <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In 2006, Leopard populations were estimated at eight individuals in Israel's Judean Desert and Negev Highlands respectively, however, they have not been confirmed since (Perez <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The species is likely extirpated in the Musandam Peninsula of Oman and UAE (J. Spalton pers. comm. 2014, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards are probably extinct in Jordan (Qarqaz and Abu Baker 2006), UAE (Edmonds <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006) and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), with the possibility of rare forays from the Negev (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/><em><strong>Southwest Asia and the Caucasus</strong></em><br/>Recent surveys found that Leopards have a wide distribution in Iran, mostly in the region of the two mountain chains consisting of Alborz running northwest to northeast and Zagros from northwest to the south (Sanei and Zakaria 2011). Their presence is also recorded in Golestan National Park, Iran which is located in the northeastern part of Iran near the border with Turkmenistan (Erfanian <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). A few recently confirmed records from Iraq and Turkey are restricted to the mountainous areas of Kurdistan (B. Avgan and H. Raza pers. comms. 2014), where Leopard is known to be scarce. There are numerous camera-trap records dated 2013-2014 confirming the presence of a small population in the Zangezur Ridge shared by Armenia and Azerbaijan (B. Avgan and A. Malkhasyan pers. comms. 2014, Voskanyan 2014, Sarukhanova 2014). Two individuals are recorded in Talysh Mountains of southeastern Azerbaijan (Sarukhanova 2014). There is recent camera trapping evidence from Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan (Avgan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Recently, a Leopard was video-trapped in North Ossetia, Georgia (P. Weinberg pers. comm. 2014). There are no confirmed recent records in Dagestan although Leopards definitely lived here in low numbers in the 1980s and the last confirmed photograph was taken in 2009 (Yarovenko 2010, Y. Yarovenko pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><u>South and Central Asia</u>: There is some indication of its presence in the Babatag and Kugitang mountains of Uzbekistan (N. Marmazinskaya pers. comm. 2014). A confirmed record of Leopard was obtained in Afghanistan in the Bamyan province in 2011 in a camera trap image (Moheb and Bradfield 2014). In Pakistan, Leopards also inhabits broken hilly or mountainous country throughout Waziristan, Baluchistan and Sindh Kohistan in association with acacia scrub forest (Roberts 1997). A recent study using DNA from scats found Leopard presence in northeast Pakistan from the Ayubia National Park (Shehzad <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards occur widely in the forests of Bhutan and Nepal. Leopards are widespread across India (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009) and Sri Lanka (A. Kittle and A. Watson pers. comms. 2014) occurring inside and outside Protected Areas.<br/><br/><u>Southeast and East Asia</u>: Leopard range has been significantly reduced in southeast and East Asia. The North China Leopard is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in Central China in the Ningxia, northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, northern Henan, western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Leopards of southeast Asia have been confirmed in protected areas in Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and southern China but are likely absent from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (S. Rostro-Garcia and J.F. Kamler unpubl. data). Some recent information indicates that they are still present in most forested regions of the island of Java, Indonesia but in very low numbers (H. Gunawan and H.A. Wahyudi pers. comms. 2015). In the Russian Far East, Leopards occur in a large area of about 7,000 km² along the eastern slopes of the East Manchurian Mountains on the border with China but their numbers are likely to be very low (Hebblewhite <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<p></p>","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for  medicinal purposes in eastern cultures).",Terrestrial,"The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and products is restricted to 2,560 individuals in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the geographic distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation.&#160; In 2014, sport hunting has been banned altogether in Botswana while South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards&#160;for the year&#160;in&#160;2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source. In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise <em>et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). In 2009, Leopards were protected from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan on the country’s Protected Species List (Zahler pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (G. Balme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Leopard population recovery efforts are currently under way with reintroduction projects in Sochi, Greater Caucasus and the Russian Far East (C. Breitenmoser pers. comm. 2015).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
166485425,15573,Oryx gazella,Least Concern,,2020,2016-01-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern as the species is numerous and widespread, and populations are currently stable or even increasing. The Gemsbok’s future is secure as long as it continues to occur in large numbers on private land and in protected areas in Southern Africa. Its high value as a trophy animal should ensure further increases in its numbers on private land.","Adapted to waterless wastelands uninhabitable for most large mammals, Gemsboks inhabit semi-arid and arid bushland and grassland of the Kalahari and Karoo and adjoining regions of Southern Africa. They are is equally at home on sandy and stony plains and alkaline flats. It ranges over high sand dunes and climbs mountains to visit springs and salt licks.<br/><br/>Although they are predominantly grazers, they broaden their diets in the dry season to include a greater proportion of browse, ephemerals and Acacia pods. They drink water regularly when available, but can get by on water-storing melons, roots, bulbs, and tubers, for which it digs assiduously. Adaptations to living in a desert environment are summarized by Knight (in press).","Presently there are no major threats to the survival of the species. In the past its numbers and its distribution declined significantly due to the expansion of human activities in Southern Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries. Yet, in the last two decades there has been widespread reintroduction of Gemsbok to private land and protected areas, For example, in Namibia the largest numbers occur on private farmland, where the estimated population increased from 55,000 in 1972 to &gt;164,000 in 1992 (East 1999). <br/><br/>Despite this favourable trend, in some areas such as south-western Botswana its distribution is increasingly restricted to protected areas, to the point where there are now two discrete concentration areas within this region, in Central Kgalagadi-Khutse Game Reserves and within and to the north and east of Gemsbok National Park. Outside these protected areas, it occurs mainly in areas of the Kalahari without cattle (East 1999).<br/><br/>Its ability to meet its survival needs within a relatively small area of semi-arid or arid savanna, even during severe droughts, enable it to occupy much smaller mean annual ranges than migratory species such as blue wildebeest and red hartebeest. The Gemsbok’s independence of surface water and non-migratory behaviour have enabled it to largely escape the adverse effects of veterinary cordon fencing (East 1999).","Population estimates are available for almost all of this species’ range. Summation of these estimates gives a total population of 326,000, but actual numbers are probably higher because of an unknown level of undercounting bias in aerial surveys. Assuming an average correction factor for undercounting bias of 1.3 would give a total population estimate of 373,000. Overall population trend is increasing in private farms and conservancies and protected areas, and stable elsewhere (East 1999, Knight 2013).",Stable,"The Gemsbok formerly occurred widely in the semi-arid and arid bushland and grassland of the Kalahari and Karoo and adjoining regions of southern Africa, with a marginal intrusion into south-west Angola (East 1999, Knight 2013). The extensive contraction in its distribution and decline of its numbers which accompanied the expansion of human activities in Southern Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries have been partly compensated in the last 10-20 years by the widespread reintroduction of Gemsbok to private land and protected areas. Today, they remain widely, albeit patchily, distributed in south-western southern Africa, although populations in Angola are now considered extirpated, even from the former stronghold in Iona N.P. (East 1999). They have also been introduced in small numbers to areas outside their natural range, such as private game ranches in Zimbabwe (East 1999).",Proportion of specimens taken from the wild and from private ranches is not known.,Terrestrial,"The largest numbers occur on private land (about 45% of the population), especially in Namibia, and in protected areas (35%) such as Namib-Naukluft and Etosha (Namibia), Central Kgalagadi-Khutse Game Reserves and Gemsbok National Park and surrounds (Botswana) and Kalahari Gemsbok National Park (South Africa). All of these populations are stable or increasing.<br/><br/>The Gemsbok is of major economic value to the wildlife industry in southern Africa. It is a key trophy species on game farms and an important component of game-capture activities. In South Africa it is in great demand among farmers because of its trophy value.

166485696,18597,Pseudoryx nghetinhensis,Critically Endangered,A2acd+3cd+4acd; C2a(i),2020,2015-11-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Assessment and conclusions are based in part on information exchanged among researchers at recent meetings of the Saola Working Group of the IUCN SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group (Saola Working Group 2009, 2013).<br/><br/>All available information indicates that the species is in a clear and protracted decline throughout its small range from intense hunting pressure, accelerated by continued opening of its habitat to increased human access (mainly through road construction). No part of the species' area of occupancy is fully protected from hunting, and some areas have almost no protection at all. Local hunters in the species’ range commonly go years without seeing an animal, indicating very low and suppressed population density. Threats from hunting are exacerbated by other factors, especially those that increase human access to remaining occupied Saola habitat, and include loss of habitat, although at present forest loss is a comparatively smaller threat to Saola than hunting. The recently constructed Ho Chi Minh Road through the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam, and its numerous feeder roads branching into Laos, plus new roads constructed under&#160; the East-West Economic Corridor development initiative, are probably unmitigatable major threats. Rates of decline are likely to increase rather than decrease, and a population reduction of &gt;80% over three generations is estimated for the past, present and future. Remaining population is estimated at &lt; 250 mature individuals, with a continuing population decline, and largest subpopulation estimated to contain &lt;50 mature individuals.","Knowledge of Saola’s historical and current range suggests that the species has a highly specific habitat association with wet evergreen forest. This is a forest type with little to no dry season (rainfall never falling on average below about 40 mm per month), which occupies a restricted geographic range mainly on the eastern (Vietnamese) slopes of the Annamite Mountains (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Lunde <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Laos, wet evergreen forests are very localised, because the main spine of the Annamites inhibits moisture-bearing clouds from crossing from the eastern, Vietnam side to the the western slopes during the months of November to April (the dry season in Laos). Only at low points along the spine are the clouds able to spill across into the western slopes and valleys in Laos. Saola occurs in these areas, where rainfall is significantly less than 40 mm per month for approximately two to four months per year. Similar hill evergreen forest areas in other regions of Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia have, however, no evidence of Saola presence, suggesting that additional local factors are probably involved. These may include cooler temperatures, extensive cloud cover, and localised edaphic or climatic factors creating conditions similar to wet evergreen forest. However, it is also likely that the close proximity of wet evergreen forest which is (or was until very recently) contiguous to drier hill evergreen forest sites with Saolas is a significant factor in this distribution pattern.<br/><br/>The Saola’s altitude range is uncertain. It seems to be mid elevation species, with most records coming from 500-800 m asl (Robichaud 2011). However, most forest lower than 500 m in its presumed range has been lost, heavily degraded, and/or heavily hunted. While it is difficult to know the species’ lower altitudinal range in the absence of human interference, there is no indication that the species occurs extensively above 1,200 m. Such high elevation forest is still extensive, and relative to that at lower elevations less impacted by people, yet there appears to be no unequivocal evidence from any source of Saola occurrence above 1,200 m.<br/><br/>Information from villagers in its range indicates that Saolas are mainly solitary, although there are some reports of groups of two or three animals, and rarely groups as large as six or seven (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1994). The species is possibly territorial, and might mark territory with scent from its large pre-maxillary gland (Robichaud 1998). However, other reports and circumstantial evidence suggest that the species might use a relatively large home range, and move between areas perhaps in response to seasonal factors. For example it has been reported that most hunted animals have been killed in winter (at least in Vietnam), when Saola are reportedly in more accessible lowland habitats (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1994). While tropical forests have inherently low ungulate biomass, natural Saola densities are probably even lower than other sympatric ungulates such as wild pigs, serow, Sambar, and muntjacs. Additionally, the generation time and reproductive output of Saolas is presumably longer and lower than that of similarly sized ungulates.<br/><br/>Single foetus pregnancy has been documented. Information from local villagers suggests this to be the norm (Robichaud 1998). Saola may have a fixed breeding season, with births occurring in the summer.<br/><br/>Evidence from camera-trap photos and observations of captive Saolas suggest that the species may be be primarily diurnal, or diurnal and crepuscular (Robichaud 1998, Robichaud 2011). Local reports suggest the species is a browser, feeding mostly on leaves (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1994, Robichaud 2011).","Natural Saola densities have probably always been relatively low, but it is clear that Saola populations must also be unnaturally depressed, as populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in its range have been significantly reduced by human exploitation. Field survey encounter rates with muntjacs and pigs in the Saola's range are remarkably low compared to some other parts of tropical Asia (there are very few published figures of encounter rates from the area, in part because it is so difficult to directly contact most species), and wild cattle, elephants, and Tigers are all nearing extinction in its range (e.g., Duckworth and Hedges 1998). Even typically resilient species such as Sambar are scarce. The declines are corroborated by local villagers across the area, who consistently report major reductions from former abundances, in the past few decades.<br/><br/>The greatest threat to Saola is hunting. While wildlife in the Saola's range are most threatened mainly by commercial hunting for the bushmeat and traditional medicine trades, specific demand for Saola is almost non-existent, because the species is unknown in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia (nor is its meat considered to be particularly tastier than muntjacs or Sambar). Instead, the animal is snared incidentally in the intense, general pursuit primarily of other species valued in the region’s wildlife trade.<br/><br/>The intensity of hunting in the Saola's range is hard to adequately describe, but some figures hint at the enormity of the problem. The human population of Vietnam is more than 90 million, that of China more than a billion. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000 and papers therein). Mammals valued in traditional Asian medicine, such as bears, Tigers and Sambar, are all hunted intensively in the Saola's range with snares, guns and dogs - all methods which are also effective at killing Saolas.<br/><br/>Although hunting for the bushmeat trade may be somewhat more localized than trade in medicinal animals (because of logistical issues of transportation before meat can spoil), its intensity is similar if not higher, because animals such as muntjacs and civets are relatively resilient to hunting and remain widespread. Probably close to ten million Vietnamese, i.e., ten million people with the propensity to eat wildlife, live within 100 km of forest inhabited by Saola. It is unlikely that any Saolas occur more than 35 km from a village. The bushmeat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted, but Saola will become extinct long before these more common species are hunted out. In Vietnam, informal interviews with hunters in Pu Huong Nature Reserve revealed that 30 Saola were killed there between 1995 and 2003 (Hoang Xuan Quang and Cao Tien Trung 2004). In some local villages in Vietnam, hunters used to kill three individuals per year 10 years ago, but now rarely catch any (Do Tuoc and Alexei Abramov pers. comm. 2006). Additionally, thousands of collectors of turtles, pangolins, rosewood, agarwood and other forest products comb every square kilometre of Saola range on a yearly basis, opportunistically hunting and setting snares for subsistence bushmeat and additional opportunistic income.<br/><br/>Although specific trade demand for Saola has been low, it could be increasing as the species grows rarer, and disposable incomes in the region expand.<br/><br/>With Saola populations now so low, local hunting for subsistence also poses a risk. Saola may be particularly susceptible to being hunted with dogs (Robichaud 1998). The pressure from proximal human settlements is so intense that there are no longer core areas in the Saola's range not regularly reached by hunters. It is likely that in 80% or more of forest within the Saola’s range, every year snares capable of catching Saolas are are set in every square kilometre. In some areas (possibly approaching 50% of potential Saola range) intensity probably reaches many thousands of snare-days per square kilometre per year.<br/><br/>Snaring is less intensive in Laos, but there the majority of Saola range lies along the Vietnam border, and is heavily hunted by transborder Vietnamese poachers, and/or coincides with the distribution of the ethnic Hmong in Laos, who avidly and effectively hunt a wide range of wildlife, including Saola. These forests are nearly as devoid of large mammals as forests in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Habitat destruction is also a threat to the species. Forests in the Saola’s range are destroyed or degraded for small-scale agriculture, commercial agriculture, timber extraction, roads, mining and hydro-power development. Although, there is presently more Saola habitat than there are Saolas, the human population growth rate in the Saola's range (both from in-migration and births) is high, which will intensify habitat lost in the coming years.<br/><br/>Presumably, the generation time of Saola is greater than three years, and reproductive output is lower than that of muntjacs, serows or Sambar, putting Saola at a conservation disadvantage. Additionally, pigs, serows, muntjacs and Sambar retain significant population reservoirs in areas of lower hunting pressure, such as difficult-to-reach areas of secondary forest, higher altitude forests and/or extensive blocks of monsoonal forest in Laos, but Saola does not. The apparent absence of Saola from extensive areas of secondary forest is either an indication of a greatly accelerated rate of decline compared with other species, or an ecological intolerance, neither of which bodes well for the species.<br/><br/>Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife medicines and bushmeat. Development projects in the region commonly cite poverty as a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but the main threat in the Saola's range, at least for the mid-term, is increasing wealth in its range countries and in China. Wealth, not poverty, is the principal driver of the region’s wildlife trade.<br/><br/>The recent construction through the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam of the Ho Chi Minh Road, parallel to and with branches to the Lao border, affects Saola subpopulations by forest fragmentation and increased human access for hunting and the rapid transportation of wildlife to urban markets. It has also led to increased forest clearance in several critical areas, especially the Hue Saola Nature Reserve and Quang Nam Saola Reserve, as well as areas in Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces. The transboundary feeder roads from the Ho Chi Minh Road into Laos are likely negatively affecting Saola in all provinces where the species occurs in Laos.<br/><br/>Saolas have proved difficult (thus far impossible) to maintain in captivity (Robichaud 1998), although no efforts involving appropriate expertise and care have yet been made (Robichaud and Long in press). Approximately twenty Saolas, at least, have been captured in Vietnam and Laos since the species was described in 1993. All died soon afterwards, with exception of two released back into the wild shortly after their capture (Stone 2006).<br/><br/>Protected area management has been largely ineffective in the Saola's range. In a few areas the situation is beginning to change, but to-date protected areas have offered little or no refuge for the species. Most protected in the Saola’s range have proved particularly impotent in the control of poaching. Some have done better at safeguarding areas from economic development, but protected areas in the region are still commonly sites of hydro-power projects, road construction, and mining.<br/><br/>Lastly there are the threats arising intrinsically from small population size, including, but certainly not limited to, the possibility that individual Saolas may now be largely isolated from one another for breeding (Saola Working Group 2009, Robichaud and Long 2014).<br/><br/>In summary, intense hunting and a multitude of exacerbating pressures on Saola are increasing, and evidence indicates that the species, which is naturally uncommon and localized, is in a major decline. Without concerted action and change, the trend is likely to result in the extinction of Saola in the foreseeable future.","The area of forest remaining in the presumed historical range of the Saola is somewhere between 5,000 to 15,000 km², but much of this range is probably no longer inhabited by the species. The number of Saola subpopulations—defined as those in non-contiguous blocks of habitat—probably numbers 6 to 15, and none likely holds more than 50 animals. Consequently, total Saola population is undoubtedly less than 750, and likely much less.<br/><br/>No formal surveys have been undertaken to estimate Saola numbers accurately (Tham Ngoc Diep <em>et al</em>. 2004). Accurate population estimates would be exceedingly difficult to obtain even if the species were not rare, due to its reported secretive behaviour, the difficulty of making direct observations in dense, rugged and remote forest habitat, and the fact that signs of the species cannot at present be unequivocally distinguished from other ungulates of similar size in its range. Furthermore, it has been difficult for biologists to gain government permission to enter and survey parts of the species range in Laos. Nonetheless, based in part on information provided by local people in its range, and partly on low returns from camera-trapping efforts, all populations are small, localised and probably significantly isolated.<br/><br/>To date, scientists have recorded Saolas in the wild on only five occasions, from camera-trap photos. In addition, some freshly killed and newly captured animals have been observed. The first photograph of a Saola in the wild was taken in 1998 by a camera trap set near a mineral spring in Pu Mat National Park, Vietnam (Whitfield 1998). Several months later the species was twice camera-trapped in Laos, in Bolikhamxay Province (Robichaud 1999). Most recently, in September 2013, an adult Saola was photographed by a camera trap in the Hue-Quang Nam landscape of Vietnam (Hance 2013).<br/><br/>The paucity of data on Saola is indicative of the species’ critically small population. Although populations of other ungulates in the Saola's range are also severely depressed, they are encountered far more commonly by local inhabitants, researchers and camera-traps than are Saolas. Sightings of these ungulates by local people occur at a frequency often two orders of magnitude higher than for the Saola, while detection rates by camera-traps are closer to three magnitudes higher for commoner species such as Red Muntjac (<em>Muntiacus muntjak</em>). Documented villager sightings of Saolas in the past decade don't number in the thousands or hundreds, but in the tens. In contrast, sightings by villagers of muntjacs, pigs and even Sambar (<em>Cervus unicolor</em>) and serows (<em>Capricornis</em>) are so common that researchers generally don't quantify them.<br/><br/>Although the low population estimates for Saola are only informed guesses, the extremely low detection rate for the species (<em>ca</em> three orders of magnitude lower than that of species like Red Muntjac) is akin (or worse) in most locations to that of better known species such as Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>), Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) and Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>). The populations of these species in the region are estimated, based on better evidence, to be of a similar order of magnitude as estimated for Saola, thus lending confidence in the Saola estimates.<br/><br/>Speculative population estimates of 70 to 700 in Laos and several hundred in Vietnam were given in the IUCN Antelope Action Plan (Mallon and Eames 2001, Timmins 2001). Subsequent surveys in Laos indicated that the population there was likely near the country's low estimate, i.e., fewer than 100 remaining (Robichaud and Timmins 2004). Similar estimates of low hundreds at most were made in the 1990s by other researchers, based on the known range and reports from hunters (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1993, Schaller and Rabinowitz 1995). More optimistic estimates have included analysis of hunter interviews conducted in In Pu Mat National Park, Vietnam in 1998 and 1999, which suggested that about 18 Saolas survived in the Khe Bong area in the southeast of the reserve and about eight in the Khe Chat and Khe Choang areas in the centre (Pu Mat constitutes <em>ca</em> 1/10 or less of the species' potential current range). In 2003, research suggested that these numbers had been reduced by about 50% over the intervening five years (Weir and Dinh Van Cuong 2004).<br/><br/>The former 2001 estimates may have been realistic at the time, but in light of a continuing high rate of decline, the current population is likely much nearer the lower figure (i.e., fewer than 250 mature individuals). The situation has deteriorated considerably since then and numbers are probably declining at a high rate due to intensive non-specific hunting of most larger species of wildlife throughout the species' range (spurred by commercial demand for bushmeat and traditional Asian medicine). This increase is unwittingly facilitated by an intense program of road and track construction on both sides of the border in the species’ range (which also contributes to habitat loss and degradation). The surviving population is suspected to be highly dispersed and its fragmentation worsening. Saola numbers may in fact be so low and dispersed that no viable populations remain.<br/><br/>There are no Saolas known in captivity.",Decreasing,"This species occurs only in the Annamite Mountains region of Laos and Vietnam. Most records are from south of the Song [River] Ca in Vietnam, south to at least Quang Nam, but a population to the north of the Ca River, in Phu Houng Nature Reserve, has also been found (Vu Van Dung<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1994, Kemp<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997). In Vietnam, evidence of occurrence comes from Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua-Thien Hue and Quang Nam Provinces.<br/> <br/> In Laos there is evidence of occurrence in Xieng Khouang, Bolikhamxay, Khammouan, Savannakhet and Xekong Provinces. Records come from as far west as central Bolikhamxay Province, but occurrence in Laos away from the main spine of the Annamite Mountains was likely always patchy because of generally unfavourable climatic conditions. The precise northern and southern limits to the species range in Laos, as in Vietnam, are still uncertain. Because of regional climatic factors, the majority of suitable habitat is, or was, probably more abundant in Vietnam than in Laos, but Vietnam's much higher human population density has severely reduced both habitat and Saola numbers in the habitat that remains. It is suspected to occur in less than 10 forest blocks in the two countries, with an extent of occurrence (EOO) probably totalling less than 10,000 km²<sup></sup>, and an area of occupancy (AOO) thought to be considerable smaller. It is probably absent from small forest fragments in the order of 100 km² or less, and is likely to be largely restricted to larger forest blocks with relatively low hunting pressure.</span>","Shot and snared opportunistically for meat by local people in Laos and Vietnam. Although rarely targeted specifically, offtake from widespread bushmeat snaring (especially in Vietnam) is a major threat. Possibly some medicinal use, but this is undocumented.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, the species was targeted for live-capture for supply to national zoos and local menageries. In 2010, an adult male Saola was captured by villagers in Bolikhamxay Province, Laos, and there were reports of subsequent attempted intentional live captures in the same province. The motivation in these instances for capturing a Saola is not clear.<br/><br/>Targeted for trophy hunting (horns) in the northern part of Vietnamese range (probably hunted in northern range in Laos by Vietnamese hunters for same reason). In 2000, horns marketed as belonging to the rare Saola were offered for sale in Hanoi, Vietnam for US$600 (Alexei Abramov pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"Saola is listed on CITES Appendix I and both of its range countries are CITES signatories. It is protected by national law in Vietnam (Decree 48; IB) and in Laos (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Regulation 360).<br/><br/>Two editions of a conservation action plan for the species in Laos were written (Robichaud 1997, 1999), and one for Vietnam (Anonymous 2006), but none of these were officially endorsed or adopted by the respective central governments. In 2010, the IUCN SSC Asian Wild (AWCSG) Specialist Group published a Regional conservation strategy for wild cattle and buffaloes in South-east Asia, which included Saola (IUCN-SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group 2010). The AWCSG’s Saola Working Group subsequently completed and continues to update an evaluation of Saola conservation priorities (Saola Working Group 2012).<br/><br/>Parts of the Saola’s presumed range in Laos that are legally protected include:<br/><ul><li>National protected areas: Nakai-Nam Theun, Khou Xe Nong Ma and Xe Sap.</li><li>Provincial protected areas: Nam Mo (Xieng Khouang province), Nam Chat-Nam Pan (Bolikhamxay province), Laving Laveun (Savannakhet province)</li><li>Other conservation areas: Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area (Bolikhamxay province).</li></ul>However, only Nakai-Nam Theun, Phou Sithone and Xe Sap have active, well-funded management. Saola probably occur in several forest blocks outside protected areas, especially in Bolikhamsay Province (potentially some of the largest populations remaining), and perhaps also in Khammouan, and to the south of Xe Sap NPA in Xekong Province.<br/><br/>Parts of the species presumed range in Vietnam that are legally protected:<br/><ul><li>National parks: Vu Quang, Pu Mat, Bach Ma</li><li>Nature reserves: Pu Huong, Phong Dien, Dak Rong, Bac Huong Hoa</li><li>Other conservation areas: Hue Saola Nature Reserve, Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserve</li></ul>The majority of the Saola’s range in Vietnam is now included in protected areas. However, unprotected forests along the international border in Nghe An and Ha Tinh Provinces are possibly still important sites for the species, especially for successful long-term conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Highest priority areas for conservation focus are:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Bolikhamxay Province, Laos.</li><li>Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area, Laos and to a lesser degree the adjacent forests in Vietnam.</li><li>Transborder area of Khammouan and Savanakhet Provinces, Laos and Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces, Vietnam.</li><li>Southern Thua-Thien Hue and northern Quang Nam Provinces, Vietnam (and adjacent areas of Laos).</li></ul><br/>The highest, urgent priority for both countries is more effective patrolling against snaring and other types of hunting within areas that have management structures (Saola Working Group 2009). Another priority is to conduct a range wide assessment of Saola status and conservation opportunities, to best direct the limited resources effectively. This includes assessing unprotected sites which might offer significant potential for Saola conservation. The recent establishment of three new nature reserves specifically to protect Saola (Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves in Vietnam, and Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area in Laos) is encouraging.<br/><br/>Until recently, there had been no demonstration of effective anti-hunting measures anywhere in the Saola’s range. In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, the government of Laos generally failed to support, and in some cases actively blocked, efforts to initiate Saola conservation activities in the country. The reasons probably related to sensitivities over hydro-power development and logging. This has abated somewhat in recent years, and efforts to conserve Saola are now more active in Laos (and in Vietnam) than at any time since the species’ scientific discovery in 1992. <br/><br/>Some of the advances have been spurred by the positive development of the establishment (in 2006) and commencement of focused activities (in 2009) of a Saola Working Group (SWG) within the IUCN SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group. The SWG has helped bring national and international attention to and support for Saola conservation; e.g. the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria made Saola the logo of its recent two-year (2012-2013), Europe-wide campaign to raise awareness and funds for the conservation of Southeast Asian wildlife. In the several years since 2009, more funds have flowed to Saola conservation activities than in all other years following the species’ discovery in 1992.<br/><br/>With the encouragement and assistance of the SWG, WWF, and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), management authorities of the three new Saola protected areas, plus Nakai-Nam Theun and Xe Sap National Protected Areas in Laos, have made significant improvements in the reduction of threats, particularly through the collection of tens of thousands of illegal wire snares. This model of international conservation organizations advising and/or funding, recruiting and managing teams of “forest guards” hired from local communities has vastly improved protection of Saola in these areas. But the teams have not yet succeeded in reducing snaring levels to near zero, and so given Saola’s small population, snaring even in these areas remains a significant threat. In most other protected areas in the Saola’s range (and areas of the Saola’s range range outside of protected areas), protection activities either do not exist or are woefully inadequate.<br/><br/>In recognition of the perilous wild status of Saola and slow pace of improved in situ protection, at its 2013 biennial meeting the SWG endorsed moving forward as quickly as possible to establish a captive ‘insurance’ population of Saola, in Laos or Vietnam with international best-practice management and technical support (Saola Working Group 2013). EAZA quickly responded by establishing an Intensive Management of Saola Advisory Group, whose role is to assist the the SWG and the range countries to design, fund, establish and staff a successful Saola captive management centre.<br/><br/>In summary, intense hunting and a multitude of exacerbating pressures continue to push Saola into a decline, even while efforts to ameliorate these and conserve Saola are increasing. It is not yet clear if the increased attention to conservation of Saola has come in time and has the capacity to save the species from extinction.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Population trends are generally increasing in protected areas and on private land and decreasing elsewhere (24%). The species’ overall status will remain satisfactory as long as it continues to be represented by large, stable or increasing populations on private land and in protected areas in southern and south-central Africa. The high numbers of this species on private land reflect its value as one of Africa’s major trophy animals. The safari hunting industry is therefore very important for ensuring the continued existence of large numbers of Greater Kudu on private land. The status of the northern populations is precarious, and their survival will depend on more effective protection and management.","Preferred habitat includes mixed scrub woodland (it is one of the few large mammals that thrives in settled areas - in the scrub woodland and bush that reclaims abandoned fields and degraded pastures-), acacia, and mopane bush on lowlands, hills, and mountains. Recorded to 2,400 m in Ethiopia (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996). Kudu are browsers; they can exist for long periods without drinking, obtaining sufficient moisture from their food, but become water dependent at times when the vegetation is very dry (Owen-Smith 2013).","The Greater Kudu’s status is less satisfactory in the northern parts of its range, due to over-hunting and habitat loss. Greater Kudus are heavily hunted, however, this does not seem to be affecting the species' overall long-term survival as they seem to be quite resilient to hunting pressure and remain abundant and well managed in other parts of its range.","Citing various authors, East (1999) indicates that population estimates are available for many parts of the Greater Kudu’s range, but many of these are based on aerial counts which tend to substantially underestimate this species’ actual numbers. The sum of the available estimates (352,000) is therefore likely to be considerably less than the true total numbers of the species. Population densities estimated from aerial surveys are frequently less than 0.1/km², even in areas where this species is known to be at least reasonably common. Higher densities of 0.2-0.4/km² have been estimated by aerial surveys in some other areas. Ground counts in areas where the Greater Kudu is common have produced population density estimates from 0.3/m² to 4.1/km² (East 1999). <br/><br/>East (1999) estimated a total population of around 482,000 Greater Kudu, with the largest populations found in Namibia, where the species remains widely abundant on private farmland, and South Africa. Population trends are generally stable or increasing on private land and in protected areas in southern and south-central Africa and Tanzania, but show a tendency to decline in other regions.",Stable,"Historically, the Greater Kudu occurred over much of eastern and southern Africa, from Chad nearly to the Red Sea, south to the Eastern Cape, west to Namibia and north to mid-Angola. While it has disappeared from substantial areas, mainly in the north of its range, it generally persists in a greater part of its former range than other large antelope species, as a result of its secretiveness and its ability to survive in settled areas with sufficient cover. As in the past, it is much more sparsely distributed and less numerous in the northern parts of its range (from northern Tanzania northwards) than further south.<br/><br/>In Eritrea Greater Kudu were observed in Semenawi Bahari on the escarpment north of Asmara in 2014 (Mallon 2014). The species may now be extinct in Djibouti, where a few were reported to survive in the south on the Ethiopia border in the 1980s (East 1999, Heckel and Rayaleh 2008). In Somalia, Simonetta (1988) suggested they may survive on the northern slopes of the Ga'an Libah in the north-west, where tracks and local reports were recorded by Mallon and Jama (2015); there are recently discovered museum specimens collected in the 1960s from south and central Somalia that expand the known historical range&#160; (Gippoliti and Fagotto 2012). There is no recent information on their status in South Sudan (they were not recorded during recent surveys in the south, Fay <em>et al.</em> 2007) or Uganda (East 1999).","The Greater Kudu is much sought after by hunters, both for the magnificent horns of bulls and more generally for their high-quality meat (Owen-Smith 2013). They are one of the most commonly hunted species in southern Africa, and generate the highest proportion (13.2%) of hunting income in South Africa (Patterson and Khosha 2005). Greater Kudu are also a favoured game-ranching species, because as browsers they do not compete with domestic livestock (Owen-Smith 2013). The percentage of animals in offtake from ranching versus wild is not known.",Terrestrial,"Greater Kudu are well represented in protected areas, from southern Tanzania to South Africa, with major populations in parks and reserves such as Ruaha-Rungwa- Kisigo and Selous (Tanzania), Luangwa Valley and Kafue (Zambia), Etosha (Namibia), Moremi, Chobe and Central Kgalagadi (Botswana), Hwange, Chizarira, Mana Pools and Gonarezhou (Zimbabwe) and Kruger and Hluhluwe-Umfolozi (South Africa). It also occurs widely outside protected areas, including large numbers on private farms and conservancies in southern Africa (Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa) where it is a mainstay of the trophy hunting industry (East 1999).

171131310,19771,Rupicapra pyrenaica,Least Concern,,2020,2020-03-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is currently increasing in numbers and range. It is not believed to approach the thresholds for any of the criteria for the IUCN Red List. Consequently, it is assessed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>R. p. pyrenaica</em> and <em>R. p. parva</em> are also Least Concern. However,<em> R. p. ornata</em> is assessed here as Vulnerable (D1+2) as this subspecies lives in very small populations and has restricted area of occupancy. It was previously assessed in 1996 as Endangered, but because of strict protection and a programme of captive breeding and reintroductions and introductions, its population has increased such that it no longer meets criterion D at this level. Ongoing conservation measures are required to ensure its future conservation.","The species is found in alpine meadows, rocky areas, forested valleys and lower slopes in mountainous regions. It generally stays above 1,800 m in alpine meadows during the warmer months of the year (Corlatti <em>et al.</em> in press). These animals make seasonal movements from steep forests in the valley slopes (in winter) to the open alpine meadows in summer (e.g. Corlatti <em>et al.&#160;</em>in press). In recent years, some populations have started to permanently inhabit forests (Herrero <em>et al.</em> 1996). Some Cantabrian populations live at 200 m. Males and females live separately outside the rutting period. Females live in groups of adults with young, while males are more solitary. The rut takes place in November and early December, and females give birth to one young after 160-170 days of gestation (Loison 1995). Longevity is about 20 years (Loison 1995).","For Pyrenean Chamois, diseases are currently the most important threat. Several keratoconjunctivitis outbreaks (Arnal <em>et al.</em> 2013) and the Pestivirus since 2001 affect populations (Serrano <em>et al</em>. 2015). Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei affects central Cantabrian population (Nores &amp; González-Quirós 2009). In Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountains, chamois coexist with domestic livestock, but there do not appear to be problems with competition; indeed, in the Pyrenees the presence of domestic livestock is considered to benefit the chamois, via maintenance of young and good quality forage, which increases the carrying capacity. Most Pyrenean and Cantabrian populations are hunted, with the exception of those living in National Parks and other Protected Areas as Nature Reserves. Pyrenean Chamois are a major game subspecies, except for Navarre region (Spain) where it was Vulnerable until 2019 and then it has been delisted (Herrero <em>et al.</em> 2016) and is important socially and economically as a source of rural livelihoods. Hunting is carefully managed and revenue from hunting is returned to the local community in Game Reserves in Spain (Pita Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Spain the regional governments and in Andorra the government set quotas, and hunting is not at an unsustainable level. In France, hunting is essentially a recreational and non-profit leisure activity, and average annual quotas are under 10% of censused populations. This is sustainable, with only a few local exceptions (C. Berducou pers. comm. 2006).The threats to the species vary in different parts of its range. Apennine Chamois may be vulnerable to many factors because their total number is small, locally decreasing, divided in only five populations, and genetic variability is very low (e.g. Lorenzini 2005, Corlatti <em>et al.</em> 2011). Space and food competition with livestock, especially domestic Caprinae, seem to have been the main limiting factors. Some poaching occurs, but does not seem to impair the viability of the populations. There are currently no problems with disease for the Italian subspecies.&#160;Presently, the major threat for Apennine Chamois seems to be the ongoing climatic change, which alters the structure, abundance and distribution of grasslands used by this ungulate, with effects on juvenile malnutrition in summer and an increase of winter mortality (Lovari <em>et al.</em>&#160;submitted).Some negative effects of high temperature/low rainfall in spring on individual survival have been reported also for an area of the French Pyrenees (Loison <em>et al.</em> 1999). Locally, chamois are also outcompeted by red deer<em> Cervus elaphus</em>, which has been recolonising Apennine areas formerly used only by chamois (Lovari <em>et al.</em> 2014, Ferretti <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Moreover, vegetation dynamics in secondary meadows of the Apennines have reduced the availability of nutritious pasture through the ongoing spread of poorly palatable plants (Corazza <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Overall, the status of this species has greatly improved since 1990. The population and range of the Pyrenean Chamois increased markedly from 1989 to 2003, although there have subsequently been some declines due to keratoconjunctivitis Mycoplasma conjunctivae (Arnal <em>et al. </em>2013) and pestivirus outbreaks (Marco <em>et al.</em> 2009, Serrano <em>et al. </em>2015). The estimate was around 53,000 in 2002 (Herrero<em> et al.</em>&#160;2004) belonging to one metapopulation. Densities of Pyrenean Chamois tend to be lower outside non-huntable areas (National Parks, Natural Reserves) and Game Reserves.&#160;<br/>The Cantabrian Chamois lives in three populations, Western, Central and Eastern. The Western and Central have around 16,000 (Pérez-Barbería <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) animals. The Eastern, result of a reintroduction in 2002-2005 (Sánchez-Martínez<em> et al. </em>2011) had 131 in 2017.&#160;<br/>Contrary to the other subspecies, numbers of the Apennine Chamois remain small. Numbers have probably been low for the last few centuries, only starting to increase in the 1920s as a result of increased protection. Numbers plummeted again to just several tens of individuals in a single population in the Abruzzo National Park during World War II (Lovari 1989). As a result of conservation actions, including re-introductions and conservation introductions, numbers have increased again and total population size is currently estimated at no less than 2,500 individuals, in five separate populations (Mari and Lovari 2006, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2019), up from a total of c. 400 individuals in the late 1980s (Lovari 1989). Presently, the number of mature individuals does not exceed 1,500.",Increasing,"<em>Rupicapra pyrenaica</em> is endemic to south-west Europe, where it occurs as three subspecies: Pyrenean Chamois <em>R. p. pyrenaica</em>, Cantabrian Chamois <em>R. p. parva</em> and Apennine Chamois <em>R. p. ornata</em> (Shackleton 1997, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). The Pyrenean Chamois is found in the Pyrenean mountains, in Andorra, France and Spain. The Cantabrian Chamois occurs in the Cantabrian mountains (Spain). The Apennine Chamois now survives only in five small to very small populations in the Abruzzo, Majella, Gran Sasso-Monti della Laga and Monti Sibillini National Parks, as well as in the Sirente-Velino Regional Park in Italy, although earlier in the Holocene it ranged from the Sibillini mountains (Marche Region, Italy) down to the Pollino massif (Calabria Region, Italy) (Masini 1985, Masini and Lovari 1988). The altitudinal range of the species is 200-3,000 m.",Hunting of this species is generally well managed and sustainable.,Terrestrial,"The species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and Annex V of the EU Habitats and Species Directive (as part of <em>R. rupicapra</em> sensu lato).&#160;In Spain, the species occurs in several Protected Areas and Game Reserves, including non-huntable areas (Picos de Europa, Ordesa y Monte Perdido and Aigüestortes i Llach de Sant Maurici National Parks; Larra-Belagoa and Muniellos Nature Reserves); and huntable ones, as Natural Parks (Fuentes del Narcea, Degaña e Ibias, Somiedo, Las Ubiñas-La Mesa, Ponga, Redes, Alt Pallars-Aran, Posets-Maladeta, Cadí, Los Valles Occidentales); Game Reserves (Los Valles, Viñamala, Los Circos, Benasque, Cerdanya, Cadi, Fresser Setcasas, Mampodre, Saja, Somiedo), among others. In France, it occurs in a number of protected areas (Pyrenees National Park, Roc-Blanc, Moudang and Mont-Vallier Mountain Reserves, Orlu Natural Reserve) and other small reserves where hunting is banned. A study of population dynamics is ongoing in France in Orlu and Bazes, epidemiological situation, as well as a detailed survey of the population size and distribution (Richard <em>et al. </em>2017, Lambert <em>et al.</em> 2018). In France, there is a hunting plan that is designed to correct geographic imbalances in numbers and distribution, but might be difficult to achieve. A major restoration effort was carried out in the French Pyrenees between 1981 and 2000, involving the translocation of more than 600 individuals (Herrero<em> et al. </em>2004, C. Novoa and C. Berducou pers. comm. 2006). New reintroductions have been carried out in the last years. In Andorra there is a monitoring and a sustainable hunting quota inside and outside reserves&#160;Apennine Chamois inhabit five separate protected areas. A group of 22 chamois was released in the Majella National Park between 1991 and 1994, and 26 were re-introduced into the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. Small captive breeding groups have been kept in six large enclosures in five parks. No studbook has been kept, which is a major shortcoming in this captive breeding program (Shackleton 1997). The subspecies is strictly protected under national and international legislation - it is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, Annex II* and IUCN Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive, Appendix II of CITES, and as a “specially protected species” under Italian hunting law. Proposed conservation measures include the following: 1) consider conservation introductions to other protected areas in the central Apennines, once their suitability has been adequately assessed. 2) When selecting individuals for transplants and captive breeding, consider the low genetic variability of this subspecies. This was most likely a result of living at low density for a long time and of population bottlenecks occurring at World Wars I and II. 3) Keep detailed breeding records, genetic profiles, and develop a studbook, for each of the captive breeding populations. 4) Avoid releasing Alpine Chamois into areas of potential (re)introduction of Apennine Chamois as, if such an action was carried out, it would prevent the subsequent release of the latter species (Shackleton 1997).<br/>Future priorities for the species as a whole include extending monitoring of all populations and increasing knowledge of demography, global change and the impact of hunting. It is particularly important that monitoring and research should take place also outside protected areas, i.e. where chamois are hunted.",Palearctic,,false,false,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean"
172360006,8982,Eudorcas thomsonii,Least Concern,,2018,2018-02-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Surveys have reported rapid declines (60–70%) from the late 1970s to the early 2000s in several places, including the main strongholds for the species: the Serengeti, Masai Mara and Ngorongoro. However, since the early 2000s the decline has slowed, from a population of 225,689 in 2002/2003 to 207,361 in 2010–2014. Thomson's Gazelle therefore does not meet any of the criteria for Near Threatened status over the past three generations (13 years) and as such is classified as Least Concern. Yet, careful monitoring of population trends is needed and it is entirely feasible that new survey information could merit transfer of this species to a threatened category. This assessment considers <em>Eudorcas thomsonii</em> and <em>E. mongalla</em> as separate species when formerly they were assessed together. Under this arrangement, Thomson's Gazelle now has a relatively restricted distribution within East Africa, which should also be taken into consideration.","Thomson's Gazelle live in the short grasslands of Kenya and Tanzania (East 1999). They are primarily grazers, although they may include more forbs and fruits in their diet in the dry season. Thomson's Gazelle are relatively drought resistant, enabling them to remain out on the dry plains, long after most other ungulates have moved off to find wetter habitats (FitzGibbon and Wilmshurst 2013). Thomson's Gazelle in the Serengeti follow a broadly similar pattern of seasonal movements to the Serengeti's migratory wildebeest and zebra populations, but remain for longer in the wet season range on the open plains in the southeast of the ecosystem and do not migrate as far north as the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya during the dry season (East 1999).","Although there do not appear to be any current major threats to Thomson's Gazelle, there is evidence that several subpopulations have undergone declines (FitzGibbon and Wilmshurst 2013). In Ngorongoro Crater, these declines have been attributed to many complex reasons including: availability of water, tourist impacts, habitat modification due to exotic plant invasion, fire management, and road development (Estes <em>et al.</em> 2006). Illegal hunting is a major concern in the west and north of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem (Arcese <em>et al.</em> 1995). The decline in the Serengeti has been suggested to be linked to the increase in the number of Wildebeest, which are competitors for food (Foley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","The migratory population of the Serengeti ecosystem (Tanzania), which is Africa's largest and most spectacular gazelle population, has been estimated most recently at 165,973&#160;(± 34,218 S.E.), based on 2010 survey results from the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI in litt. 2010), which is indicative of a steep decline since the estimate of 500,000 in the early 1980s (Sinclair and Norton-Griffths 1982).<br/><br/>In the Ngorongoro Crater (Tanzania), Estes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2006) estimated an average population size of 3,472 individuals between 1968–1978, which has since decreased to a low of 1,257 in 2005 (Estes <em>et al.</em> 2006) before rising to 2,399 (± 616 S.E.) in 2014 (TAWIRI in litt. 2010).<br/><br/>Across Kenya, Thomson's Gazelle have declined from <em>ca</em>. 147,000 individuals in 1977–80 to <em>ca</em>. 44,000 in 2011-13 (Ogutu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). For example within Kenya, the Masai Mara ecosystem (Masai Mara reserve and Mara Ranches) populations were estimated at around 100,000 individuals (with ~80% in the Mara Ranches) between 1977–79 and by 2007–09 had been reduced to around 26,000 (Ogutu <em>et al. </em>2016). There are also reports of declines in the Ewaso Nyira basin, where numbers were estimated at <em>ca</em>. 33,000 in 1977, but at one-third of this in 1997 (Muchoki 2000).<br/><br/>Globally, the population of Thomson's Gazelle declined sharply from 438,650 (Tanzania - 390,420; Kenya - 48,230; East 1999) in 1996–1999 to 225,689 (Tanzania - 175,689; Kenya - 50,000; Mduma 2003; Estes <em>et al.</em> 2006; Ogutu <em>et al.</em> 2016) in 2002/2003 but this decline has since plateaued, with the current (2010–2014) global population estimated at 207,361 (Tanzania - 168,372; Kenya - 38,989; TAWIRI in litt. 2010; Ogutu <em>et al. </em>2016), approximately 145,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Thomson's Gazelle currently inhabit a relatively small range in S Kenya and N Tanzania, largely restricted to the high plains and <em>Acacia </em>savannas above 500 m (Estes 1991, East 1999, FitzGibbon and Wilmshurst 2013). The largest populations occur in the Mara ranches, Masai Mara National Reserve and the Laikipia and Kajiado rangelands. In Tanzania, the species occupies about half of its former range (East 1999).","Thomson's Gazelle are hunted for their meat (shot or snared), and as trophies.",Terrestrial,"Thomson's Gazelle occur in a number of protected areas in their range, with core areas of the Serengeti-Mara subpopulation protected by the Serengeti N.P. and Masai Mara N.R., where wildlife tourism is the only permitted land use (FitzGibbon and Wilmshurst 2013). The core areas are surrounded by buffer zones: Maswa G.R., Grumeti G.R. and Ikorongo G.R. to the southwest, Ngorongoro Conservation Area amd Loliondo Game Controlled Area to the southeast and the Mara Ranches to the north (FitzGibbon and Wilmshurst 2013).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
